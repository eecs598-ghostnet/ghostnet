Shoutout to Chi-Town!
Dedication 5, since '05!
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass, wit'cho fine ass
You fine as two grapes gettin' stomped out by a giant cask
You the best dressed with ya breasts showin'
Like a salad, no dressing  take ya to ya favorite restaurant
Ask for the bread then fuck in the restroom
They don't ask for a pass when yo ass waltz in my dress room
You the best bride and I'm the best groom
Wedding presents got my best man at the Best Buy buyin' the best of Fresh Prince for the bedroom
I'm a buy a summer house, with a rec room
And a car with no backseat and some leg room
And some strawberries and some chocolate and a fridge and some broccoli
Cause I know you like vegetables even though I don't
I won't say, I won't eat it if you chef it
Fuck it, I'll hire Geoffrey to get a beverage if you should ever get parched
You feel like Ruby Dee to me, great and powerful Ossie
Who's behind the man behind the curtain? Foxy
Coffee, brown as the bosom I flew in on
Nose round like the wheels that my rims spin on
Lips full like the light on the dash was flickin', oh wait it wasn't
Oh and I forgot I'll take a microwaver oven
So we could kick the butler out and we can make a muffin
Maybe bake a dozen
My homeboy like yo sister, maybe they can bake some cousins, ooh isn't that sweet?
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass
This is not a love song, this is a you song
I just happen to love ya
Uhh, give you the world if it was for me
My diamond grill make it hard to see I'm lyin' through my teeth
And now I'm flyin' on my PJ, lookin' at the clouds
Thinkin' about yo ass and how it look like a big smile
I get mental flashbacks of your ass crack, lemme get back on track
You say I act like I don't miss you, that's because I don't act
But anyway, we can role play or get straight to it
Sorry, my mind in the gutter, better yet sewer
And when you say "I love you", I stutter "I-I love you too"
It's Wayne's World, she say "What is this world comin' to?"
And she know me and whoever together, she hope we comin' loose
She told me that if she ain't the one, she gon' throw up the deuce
I laughed at her, we took a bath together and splashed each other
Then she got serious and said "Tune, I gotta ask you somethin'
Do you really love me?" I tried to change the subject
So I said some crazy shit to her like
"What if you and I were just letters?
That'd be unfortunate we'd have to rob a fortune teller
But I swear I think I love you, fingers crossed in my pocket
Okay that's a dead subject, you bring it up, that's a zombie
You remind me of, my memory ain't what it used to be"
She said she ain't trippin', I know because I move my feet
And when she figure out that she been swindled
I'll be cleanin' that love bird shit off of my window
I-I love you too
I mean how many times, h-how many times I gotta
How many times I gotta say it for it to count?
Are you countin'?
I loved the pictures, I needed that, I swear I did
I was just thinkin' about you when you sent them too
You don't believe me? I know
D5, whattup five? I-I love you too, I do
I met her when I was young and she was younger
With a body like woman so her age meant nothing
I had to get her number 
After how she made them daisy doots fit her all summer
I'm wishing I could hit her all summer
And all she ever wanted
Was for young Weezy to love her
But all I ever wanted was to cum easy and dump her
But that didnt come easy
'Cuz she ended up being my baby's mother
and then I felt smothered but little did I know
I'd never find the same girl inside another
But I never thought that I'd be looking for her
And I never thought that late at night
When I'm in the mix laying down with some chick
That suddenly it'll click
How this broad in my drawers dont know shit 
Bout what I did 'fore I was big
When's there's a woman with my kid where I should be
She screamed to me What?
My love, my patience, my pain OK
Nigga please
I got the young'n blues y'all
I met her after the fame
And she aint even like me but I got her after the game
Mami was a nice piece, young Cali sweet thang
Made her into wifey and then reality changed
It was going good I was happy again
But then things got rapidly strange
And it had to be Wayne
She was still a virgin
What more could I ask from a dame
But I was a bastard I asked for the pain
Now my ass in the rain
And she got a new life the picture flipped
And none of it includes Weez and all his bullshit Shit
And I remember the Bahamas for the weekend 
We was freaking in the suite
And she looked sweet enough to beat it up
Till we began to sleep and I
I'm dreaming 'bout the Victoria Secret lingerie
Told me keep itshe aint want moms to see it
And just think I once saw it on the girl's body
Now all I'm seeing is nobody
I got the young'n blues y'all
You see I never really ran, but no gentleman
All I know is big pimpin' ma'am
I'm just tryna be Weezy
And the perfect husband just might be too hard to find in me, Weezy
Baby girl you gotta work with ya boy
'Cuz all of that cursing it be hurting ya boy
Look for the better not the worst in ya boy
And maybe I can be ya boy Ya know what I'm sayin'
But see this here is not your everyday love tune
It's the story of your everyday thug dude
And in your mind you prolly thinkin we don't love you
But on the real we just not used to what love do
And please consider that
We were taught to love money, ice, cars, and clothes
Love pussy but you dont love them ho's
Love ya niggaz love ya children
Now if they got a bitch you could love that
Holla back
I got the young'n blues y'all
Young Weez'got the young'n blues y'all
I got the young'n blues y'all
Uhh, I got shotguns under my staircase, rob yo hoe ass barefaced
Been had this bitch on lock, I'm bout to get this bitch a cellmate
All my life I been this cold, all my nights I spend with hoes
I keep change on me now cause this shit's startin to take a toll
I just flew two hoes in, oh how time flies, clip it's wings
Make you spit that safe combination out like Listerine
And even though I'm not an artist, this is where I draw the line
We don't feel none of you niggas, y'all some fuckin porcupines
I still got residue all on my dinner plates, real niggas in my inner circle
None of my checks come late, I ain't havin' that, I give 'em curfews
Dressed up like a old lady, uzi under my church dress
Surprise yo ass like a baby, takin' his first steps
Im too good for just any bad bitch, smoke like I've been kissin' dragons
That milk carton show her missin' panties, that pussy felt like a hidden valley
Thank God that I'm so gifted, I wouldn't return a single gift
But all good things must come to an end like this blunt burnin' my fingertips
Lil Tunechithis ain't what you want
Put that gun to yo hoe head, make her tell me what you don't
Got some moon rocks in my pockets, that's a pocket full of stones
Fuck with me cause I fucked around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong
Ow! Neil Armstrong ow! Neil Armstrong
Fuck with me cause I fucked around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong
Got some moon rocks in my pockets, that's a pocket full of stones
Fuck with me cause I fuck around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong

I kiss every single body part, her body is a work of art
I'm way too high, her skirt too short, I think I love her, it was just a thought
I pop up in that coupe 'bout to go back to the future
And she said "Tune, not in my mouth", you should've said it sooner

We are at war with the universe, the sky is falling
And the only thing that can save us now
Is sensitivity and compassion
But I know one thing's for sure
I'm gonna get my kicks before it all burns down
Some say tragedy's hard to get over
But sometimes that tragedy means it's over
Soldier, from the academy league of rollers
I deny being down though they seem to hold us
My, shoulders are strong I prove 'em wrong
I ain't doing nothing but moving on
Let the truth be known
But they talked that freedom at us
And didn't even leave a ladder,
I work at the corner store
We all got problems, problems
No one's gonna fly down low
No one's gonna save us now 
How you feel you're not alone
We're all just jealous, jealous
We don't reach the sky no more
We just can't overcome, no
You tie my hands what am I gonna be?
What have I done so bad?
What is my destiny?
You tie my hands what I am I suppose to see?
What have I done so bad?
What am I gonna be?
I, knock on the door, hope isn't home
Fate's not around the lucks all gone
Don't ask me what's wrong ask me what's right
And I'ma tell you what's life, and did you know?
I lost everything, but I ain't the only the one
First came the hurricane, then the morning sun
Excuse me if I'm on one
And don't trip if I light one, I walk a tight one
They try tell me keep my eyes open
My whole city underwater, some people still floatin'
And they wonder why black people still voting
'Cause your president still choking
Take away the football team, the basketball team
And all we got is me to represent New Orleans, shit
No governor, no help from the mayor
Just a steady beating heart and a wish and a prayer
These friends they come and go
But I got family, family
These kids so fast they grow
They learn so quickly now
That there's nowhere to go
That there's no future, future
Don't make this here so low
And we can't overcome, no
And if you come from under that water then there's fresh air
Just breathe baby God's got a blessing to spare
Yes I know the process is so much stress
But it's the progress that feels the best
'Cause I came from the projects straight to success and you're next
So try they can't steal your pride it's inside
Then find it and keep on grinding
'Cause in every dark cloud there's a silver lining
I know 
See right now we just riding on love
A shot in the dark
We ain't tryin to do nothing but hit the heart
We need love
That's all y'all, that's all
Yeah, Born right here in the USA
But, due to tragedy looked on by the whole world as a refugee
So accept my emotion
Do not take it as an offensive gesture
It's just the epitome of my soul
And I must be me
We got spirit y'all, we got spirit
We got soul y'all, we got soul

Twelve rounds comin, bells ringin
Introduced to the game, when I was just a child
Mama love a drug dealer, straight quit her job
And took his life, and along with him, I died
And she died, we died
Then came my daughter, to my bed side
Told me daddy, don't cry, I'm alive

But this is how the note ends
Ya know, let's kick it back

Ladies and Gentlemen, you know me
You know I ride for my mother fuckin' niggas
Most likely I'm a die with my finger on the trigger
They tell me don't get high and I should try and make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler and I'd rather make a killing
My eyes be so wide as they rise in the skillet
I let my bitch bag it, if she spill it I'm a kill her
I bullet-proof the ride now I feel like armadillos
And fuck a hospital, Young Money we the illest
And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest
My flow is nasty like CY Phillies
Self-made G and them bitches know the business
We lightin' all rappers in the kitchen, I'm a chemist
And when I was five my favorite movie was The Gremlins
Ain't got shit to do with this but I just thought that I should mention
You lookin' for divine, and a little intervention 
And the Byrds don't fly without my permission
I'm probably in the sky, flyin' with the fishes
Or maybe in the ocean, swimmin' with the pigeons
See my world is different, like Dwayne Wade
And if you want trouble bitch, I want the same thang
And you know that I'm a ride with my mother fuckin' niggas
Most likely I'm a die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry 'bout mine,  I'm a grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the Sky Is the Limit
The Sky Is the Limit
and if you look high you'll see that I'm gon' be in it
Fuck ten in the coup and your bitch love it
Switchin' lanes, fast third then she switch subjects
Tell a bitch "don't talk to me,
And if you talkin' to them niggas, don't talk for free"
And I hate when a nigga say, "talk is cheap"
'Cause I'm the type to let money talk for me, yeah
My flow is art unique, yeah
My flow can part a sea
The only thing on the mind of a shark is eat
By any means and you just sardines 
I got the 40 cal tucked in my PRP's
What do you expect, I'm from New Orleans 
And the guarantee of my city is riders
They tryin' to make a brand-new map without us
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars
And no matter how you change it it'll still be ours
And you don't want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulders
Run up in your house and shoot everyone that sittin' on a living room sofa that's fucked up
And you don't want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulders
Mail it to your mom with a dozen a roses now that's fucked up
And I'm a G, and you ain't gotta know the alphabets to see
I know my whole city is depending on me
And I forget a lot of shit, but I cannot forget the streets

Bandanna in my right pocket

As I sit in a throne

I tell her "Now gon' pop that pussy for a real nigga"
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggaz is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, The Lord is my witness
So on my Libra scale, I'm weighin sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch, well just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me, nose-bleed seats
and today I went shoppin, and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I've been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet, hehe

Haters cain't see me but them bitches still lookin for me

Put your two cents inm and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about  I , give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry, call that "wine and dine"
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin pulses
They say choose wisely, that's why I was chosen
Rockin like asphalt, it's the cash's fault
Looked in the face of death, and took its mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south, and her ass north
But I'm, Ray Charles to the bullshit

Slide through the drive through of a fast food restaurant
Turn the music down and tell the broad what kind of sauce I want
Scratch off quickly to a main street, intentions to make cheese

My bitch keep saying that the judge got a date for me

Shine so hard like the fucking sun facing me, basically
Take it how you take it, I be making you be hating me
Loving me but hating me, hoe you got to pay for me
Riding in the big boys, sitting on them grown folks
Every time I park, it's a motherfucking car show
I guess I'm the number one Lakers fan
Yellow bottle, yellow bottle, purple bag, purple bag
Well they know me as the Curren$y, but some call me the Hot Spitta
Sittin in the Chevy on three wheels like a tricycle
Always been a fly nigga since I was a little one
Bottle pop like NBA finals is what we want
I puff a lot of blunts with my nigga Weezy B 
One night I was so high I thought that I forgot how to read
Young Money fly boys, money weed and different breed
Throwing parties at secret locations somewhere on the beach
We often bring them Patron shots for the models
And send a bottle of that Cris' up to the DJ

The bottles, the battle, the beetles'll eat you
Momma named Cita, I love you Cita
Member when your pussy second husband tried to beat you?

We are not the same I am a martian
And I'm hotter than summer rain like Carl Thomas
Lock, load, ready to aim at any target
I could get your brains for a bargain
Like I bought it from target
Hip hop is my supermarket
Shopping cart full of fake hip hop artists
I'm starving, sorry I gotta eat all it
And I'll be back in the morning
We are not the same I am a alien
Like Gonzales, young college student who done
Just flipped the game like Houston, I'm used to
Promethazine in two cups I'm screwed up
And you ain't shit if you ain't never been screwed up
Flow so sick make you wanna throw your food up
Ice water chest, and my wrist like a cool cup
Two twin clippers, I give your ass a crew cut
I get bread like cold cuts you know what?
Your girl go down fast, come up slow, but I never slow up
They don't make 'em like me no more
Matter fact, they never made it like me before
I'm rare like Mr  Clean with hair
No break lights on my car rear
I never hade life, and I never had fear
I rap like I done died and gone to heaven I swear
And yeah I'm a bear like black and white hair
So I'm polar
And they can't get on my system 'cause my system is the solar
I am so far from the outhers, I mean others
I could eat them for supper, get in my spaceship and hover, hover
Yeah when I step in the spot, motherfuckers say, "Who that?"
Big Bun Beater, but you already knew that
Live from the state where they chop it and screw that
You hatin on the trill OG, where they do that? for real!
Motherfuckers need to get off the dick man
Fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
Get out my mix man, just go' get you stuck
Deeper in the quicksand, with no easy fix man damn!
No tricks man, those is for kids
Kush in my cigar, and hoes in the crib
Drank and the 20 ounce froze in the fridge
You fuckin with PA so you know what it is what it is
I'm sittin on the fours that clack
Comin down candy in the golden ‘Lac
We gettin to the money like it's Goldman Sachs
And we do it for the pimps that are holding back, let's go!
Look who crept in with automatic weapons, reppin QB till the death of him
That nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants like Kanye West and Em
Track record goes back to “The Essence”
Smack adolescents who ask who the best is
I'm nasty like gas from a fat man, attested
I pass it, you gaspin for breath and you die fast
But I'm like a gastronomic bypass
Bunch of Nas advocates, actors seemed to get typecast in the same role
Since sixteen I ain't grow a day old yet my brain grow, cocaine white Range Rov'
Tats on my body like an art exhibit, I did real good for a project nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper, now it's Chandon, fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden, I was real young, look at youth, a novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected, chowed down now my food's digested
Pow pow, with my shooters are techs, bust louder than the noise that I just spit
Let's get one thing straight that my crown ain't for testin testin
Chop heads off like King Henry the Eighth, guillotine to ya neck bitch!
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since '91
Niggaz can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is  sealed , no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wylin dude, studied cowards that made power moves
Watched Wild Planet seen lions devour food, you can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggaz
And yo my nigga Waynelet them niggaz hate
And like my nigga Drake say, "We ain't got time to respond to niggaz"
I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be
I'm a shotta, when I pop up with them poppers burn ya block up
Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin over Gotham
Word to Poppa
Bl-bl-blood gang, five! It's that Blood gang, five, but green is the bottom line
I run this town, I ain't gon' lie, they run they mouth, they ain't gon' fight
They actin like they ain't gon' die until I let them llamas fly
Flatbush to Bed, do or die, from Watts to Larry Hoover Chi
Poverty and heroine, it's no place for a juvenile
Greed in our heart, it's the green that we want
Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss!
They say I'm underrated , but un-compete-with-able
Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me? Unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That's when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth got 'em sayin
"There he goes again!"
See now they nominated a nigga to come and flatten everything
Now let me dominate it, nigga run
And they be knowin that I be blackin on everything
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake ‘em when I come and shake ‘em
And bake ‘em and take ‘em to another place
Ain't no fakin, ain't no kind of mistakin how I be breakin up
Everything and be creating a s-s-s-situation when I'm done damn!
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done killed more cats than curiosity snitch!
Most of you niggaz sorry and owe apologies quick
What the fuck you niggaz still hangin'around here for? You apostrophe bitch!
Okay, now enough of that, see now I'm out the door
They say opposites attract, so hear I am girl
With my pistol in my pocket
Hidden under right in my jockey
They say opposites attract so here she is girl
With the master of bachelor
She just become a doctor
Operate on me
I need that open heart surgery
cause the way my heart is feeling
I can't make it through the night
Pocket full of money and some dark shades
Flow so current he can start waves
Game like butter he Parkay
Love me some head like shortay's
Coppin quarters like the arcades
Getting high with my animals in our cage
And you can see us if we start gaze
Creole boy maybe I sauté
On your mark, ready, start race
That's just you making my heart race
And I may be the opposite, but I'ma let cha operate, yeaah
And I know she wants the D-boy
So I'ma pop on her like kee-loy
And I got that magic like Bruce Leroy
If this isn't it, then love got a a decoy
Ger body sicker than retard
And I bet I got the medicine she need for it
And I bet I got the medicine to keep going
She shoots me happiness and I bleed joy
No band-aid for me boy
I lost my love, yeah they girl got me weak for it
Yeah I see you, and I see you, when I see you
Girl you're the one can I be two
And if your love is clear then I see through
Then they yell clear and I'll pull through
You save my life baby I will too
Then they say

On my way to the east to the laundromat

I brought my bag of oranges, its time to juice it

Put the laser on the 45 iron, stupid
One shot to remind who is the fly lil nigga dat's behind da trigger

You will never see me like momma tigger
An eighty's baby a fightin' nigga, I got it on my mind like a psychic nigga

See me over the viking stove I am lighting bricks
Or in the middle of the shoot out, I'm tighting clips
Pop another one shoot back while lighting spliffs I do this
You catching my drift representing with my section on my belly and shit

This is my crown, my throne
This is me on my own, let's get it on
So roll the carpet out, cause you fuckin' with a nigga from the royal south
See you are either in or you are out 
And if you out stay in 'cause  them warriors are out
Because those vultures, cops, and those lawyers are out
So I just open up the gate and let my holliers out
No nigga I neva call your house I am probably some where taking Toya out
Not answer my phone and ignoring your spouse
She leavin' messages about me enjoying her mouth
Hey, I am ready to knock a boy in the mouth
Give me the name, naw better yet point him out
Me and the streets got a joint account
I am from the streets that you need to be warned about
New Orleans, wodie put the gat in your mouth
And if we feed you with a lot of iron it will flatten you out
A few roaches but never had no rats in this house
Never telling one another leave dat in the house
Always been a small hustler moving my packing out
If I ever run into some trouble send my savages out
These niggaz talking sweet I will get dem cavities out

This is me on my own, let's get it on
I have no doubt, that I could love you forever
The only trouble is, you really don't have the time
And when they see me, they see 3 baby
She marks her calendar, we schedule every plan
She knows when I'm coming, she's more than a fan
She got my tour dates, she also got a man
But even homie gotta understand
She got one night only 
And no one gon take it from her, nothing's gon' make her miss it
And when I go she'll miss it
But she'll never forget that one night only 
Next day another city, she's never coming with me
I'm nothing more than memories
Memories she keep forever
She always dream about me, wish she could sleep forever
She get her fit together, she get her shit together
After my concert, she wanna get together
I get her on my bus, we chill and sit together
She has no curfew, I can take the bitch wherever
Come off a bit respectful, I'm on a different level
I got her feelin special, then she remember
She got one night only
But I can make you love me forever
Baby I can make you love me forever
Now all the hoes hate her, the dudes wanna date her
Her nigga saw her leave, she deal with him later

She let that nigga love her, she let that nigga save her
But when I come she let a nigga take her
Take her for one night only 
She turnin off her phone, she turnin off her page
Tell hime that shit on roam, that nigga goin in labor

These niggas hate the game, but they can't block the layup
And she go home to him, he sicker than a patient

He ask her where she been, she say stop trippin it was one night only
But I can make you love me forever

And we got one night only 
I got a wife, she knows, my wife aint on the road
When she come to my room, she take off all her clothes
Say anything hoes, tomorrow same clothes
We probably order movies, we probably lay together
But we can't stay together, that's when I gotta tell her
I have no doubt, that I could love you forever

If it's fuck it then fuck it, now you speakin' my language
Put your dead body under them white sheets with no blankets
I'm so rich, I go poor/pour, champagne and don't drink it
Ice on my neck like I fainted
These are the thoughts of the brainless
No new friends, we don't talk to strangers
Man I'm so serious with this pimp shit, full clip in my Mac 10
Ain't no exit out the game, nigga cut off your blinkers
And if she married I fuck her, if she lonely I fuck her
If she crazy I love her, y'all just don't understand her
She say "You got it made", I say "No, I got a butler"
They tell me to turn up but I'm the knob on the oven
I got a knife in my pocket if there's a fork in the road
I'm the man of steel/steal, but I won't say what I stole
Bring that coke to the stove and whip it like a new slave
Whip it like a new slave, like it's freezin' and you naked

And if so, make sure my kids see my cash
And I know, I'm silent like an album cast
And my future will be better than my past
You can love me or hate me
I swear it won't make me or break me
I'm going wherever the money take me
Until they funeral and wake me, and don't wake me
Cause I'm sleeping, I'm dreaming
I know that there's a better way cause I've seen it lord
But this faster money is so convenient
And I need it, say I need it
C-A-R-T-E-R

I spit rounds like the Tiki bar
And if I got beef I'm the meat cleav-ah
And I are, the illest nigga Martin Luther King died for
And I ride for, Hollygrove 1-7, Eagle Street
And I'm higher than an eagle's feet, but I believe in me
Apple is the cross street, I am just an offspring
Born in the ghetto, that's why I can't let go
One call, I'll have my dogs on ya like an echo
Baby I am the real deal, no pickle
Uh, I spit single cell psycho
I go, off like a motherfucking rifle
And I'm from, the underground baby like a pipe hole
And I will stand tall like light poles until the light blows
And you can love me or hate me
Baby I swear it won't make me or break me
And I be going wherever the money take me
Until they funeral and wake me, and don't wake me
Cause I'm sleeping, and I'm dreaming
See I'm just hustling, living what I believe in dog
And it's a problem when a homie's not eating
And I'm greedy, I'm greedy
Share my blood, feed my family
My flow will have to plead insanity
So sick I need Grey's Anatomy
Acid like a bust open battery
I'm cool like L A  nights
I'm tight like ballet tights
Eight twelves, I swear the other day I pissed Cristal
These bitches try to kick it like gentiles
I've got to watch my head in the battle
I'm just trying to stay ahead of my shadow
And I'm floating like a boat and a paddle
Alligators and rattlesnakes
But I promise I will take a nigga off like a Saturday
Got money to validate, I'm icy like carrot cake
Different coloured diamonds make me look like a salad plate
I'm straight out the alley, wait, it's the nigga ya daddy hate
Weezy F  Baby, great!
I know they love me then hate me
But I'm a G, it won't make me or break me

Even in the dungeon I glow, even if it ain't sunny I glow
If it ain't 'bout money I go, no where I nail to the flo'
Money controls where I go, it is the sail to my boat
And it's goin' down, it's goin' down, like there's a whale in the boat

Mona Lisa smile, that bitch barely grinnin
Take you off the face of the Earth like a blemish
We went from  Boyz  to menace, Menace II Society
Now we get higher/hi-ya, call that shit karate
Blame it on the money, the money is the bad guy
Smoke so much good, I don't even have a bad side

Bitches eat me up like my name is Russell Stover
Murder the perception, make 'em get it right
If I'm flirtin with affection, I'm fuckin her tonight
I'm a Southerner's delight, Louisiana pride
The belly of the beast, it ate me alive
Tell them bitches they'll never take me alive
And today I took a walk outside
Uhh, and we all kiss our mommas
Cause promises are broken but tomorrow is a promise
Think I'm gettin sick I'm feelin ill-legal
And not havin money is the root of all evil
Life is a midget, so try to live it up
If these walls could talk, they'd probably won't shut up
I need some wallpaper, before they start to fuss

Then she shoot over to my house, I scoot over in her bed, I shoot off in her mouth then she bit the bullet
Uh, skatin on 'em like Iâ€™m Lil Wayne, and the weed so strong I can feel veins
Write it down, take a picture now I feel framed, the drugs got me so numb, I can't feel ashamed
And my girl at home with the mood swings, girl I gotta make a few runs like Usain

Pop some pills that make me sleepy, hoes, creep me, in they teepee

To that new nigga with my old hoes-kudos
For my niggas on Rikers Island back there playing Uno
Getting swole like popeye for niggas walking around like Bruno
I'm in the bed with a duo, laid up like two points

Like where the fuck did my heart go, and show me something I haven't seen
And give me what Martin sleep, on the same night he had a dream
And take me to where I've never been, but not to where I'll never be
And I ain't never scared but I'm scared of me, me versus me I need a referee
Need weaponry, especially if the treasury in jeopardy
Fuck deputies big letter B, need equity, need credit clean
To trafficking from peddling like everything from amphetamines to medicine
These niggas sweeter than Nectarines and Grenadine
Tell me something I don't know, like what happened to hard coke
You can call me Eddy cause I stay ready, my family call me Eduardo
I'm music to these bitches ears I hit that ass like the wrong note
My bitch bad with corn rows with boots on in farm clothes
You can find me prancing in the finest mansion with the finest dancer with a height advantage
She want cocaine pills and weed, liquor and dick she gotta micro manage
I'm just eating rappers they go nice in salads with some diced up carrots

Married to the Benjamins, battle all my enemies
Riding with Big Foot, Harry, and the Hendersons

You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It's seems like you came back ten times over

Lookin through all your thoughts and lookin over your shoulder
Ohh and you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions

Soo Woo to the B gang
Rest in peace
Wheres my coffee?
Hey sweetie
Looks like it's gonna be a long day
Uhhh another one huh? What we got
Your first patient 
Is suffering from a lack of concepts
Originality
His flow is weak
Another one
And he has no style
What you got for him?
Tssss okay
Let me put my gloves on, and my scrubs on
Excuse me if I'm late but like a thief it takes
Time to be this great uhhh so just wait
Your style is a disgrace your rhymes are fifth place
And I'm just grace one uno ace
And I'm tryna make your heart beat like bass
Hmm mm, but you're sweet like cake
And I come to fix whatever you shall break
Where is your originality you are so fake
So picture me like a gallery capture what I say
All I need is one mic all I need is one take
Like hey! brighter than the sun ray
Got a pistol on a playground watch the gunplay
Like no kidding no kids in the way
But the kids do watch gotta watch what we say
Gotta work everyday gotta not be clichéd
Gotta stand out like Andre 3K
Gotta kick it, kick it like a sensei 
You gotta have faith you gottta gotta
Wait wait I think I, I think I lost him
I don't know about this one
His confidence is down, vocab and metaphors needs work
And he lack respect for the game
Uhhhh let me see
You think you can save him?
Okay respect is in the heart so that's where I'ma start
And a lot of heart patients don't make it but hey kid
Plural, I graduated
'Cause you can get through anything if Magic made it
And that was called recycling Re: reciting something 
'Cause you just like it so you say it just like it
Some say it's biting but I say it's enlightening
Besides Dr  Kanye West is one of the brightest
And Dr  Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest
And Dr  Jeezy can fix you back up the nicest
Arthritis in my hand from writing
But I'm a doctor they don't understand my writing
So I stopped writing now I'm like lightning
And you ain't  Vince Young  so don't clash with the  Titan 
Fast and exciting my passion is frightening
Now let me put some more vocab in your I V 
Here take this Vicodin like it and love it
And confidence has no budget
So pay me no mind
I don't walk it like I talk it 'cause I run it
I don't do it 'cause I done it
And I'm in the emergency on it
God dunnit I've lost another one
But this one looks much better than the others
His respect is back up, concepts sound good
His style is showing strong signs of improvement
All he needs now is his swagger
Okay let me take my gloves off then
Swagger tighter than a yeast infection
Fly go hard like geese erection
Flashing patrol police detection
Eyes stay tight like Chinese connection
Eyes stay tight like pussy at night
Baby don't get me wrong I can do that pussy right
But I'm too wrong to write too fresh to fight
Too paid to freestyle too paid to freestyle
Had to say it twice swagger so nice
And don't ask me shit unless it concern a price
And I don't rap fast I rap slow
'Cause I mean every letter in the words in the sentence of my quotes
Swagger just flows sweeter than honey oats
That swagger I got it I wear it like a coat
Wait, as I put the light down his throat
I can only see flow his blood starting to flow
His lungs starting to grow this one's starting to show
Strong signs of life where's the stitches here's the knife
Smack his face his eyes open I reply “What a night”
Welcome back hip hop I saved your life
He looks good, his vitals are up 
He's looking good he's looking good
Yep yep we got one we saved him he's good
He's good we got one he's good
He's good we got him 
We saved him he's a go he's good

College bitches keep me with 'em like cliff notes
Cold bitches keep me with 'em like thick coats

All the bitches love me, I need a thick guard
And if she don't give head she's a nimrod
Bitch i'll never put your number on my sim card

Make her get over here like Scorpion
And when it comes down to the recording
I must be Lebron James if he's Jordan
No, I won rings for my performance
I'm more Kobe Bryant of an artist
Same coach, same game, been starting
 Same tri-angle Offense
I come through the lane like Dargent
Referee niggas is lame, they call charging
I have no brain I'm retarded

You can be my Jane, I'm your Tarzan
I'm from the jungle where the snakes is all poison
I am magnificent like Marcus
You might wanna fall back like August
Or late september whatever you call it
I hit niggaz in the head like Vonage
I am talking to no particular audience
But understand I'm the guardian
And understand there won't be no guardin him
You will just get played like an accordion

I keep pussy running like a faucet
She better catch like she Steve Largent
Because I'm "What's up" like "Martin"

But you don't understand me so let me explain
Stood in the heat, the flames, the snow

my God is my judge, no gown no gavel
I'm a rebel, down to battle
now or never, I would never ???
fucking fantastic, fuck if you agree
but I don't give a fuck if you see me
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood
What's understood ain't gotta be explained

bright pinky rings but that ain't about this
what you bout bitch
excuse my French emotion in my passion
but I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion
what are you asking, if I don't have the answer
it's probably on the web, like I'm a tarantula
but I know you don't understand, cuz you thought Lil Wayne is weezy
but weezy is DWayne
I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh lord please don't let me be misunderstood
I was watching t v  the other day right
got this white guy up there talking about black guys
talking about how young black guys are targeted
targeted by who? America
you see one in every 100 Americans are locked up
one in every 9 black Americans are locked up
and see what the white guy was trying to stress was that
the money we spend on sending a motherfucker to jail
a young motherfucker to jail
would be less to send his or her young ass to college
see, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that
our jails are populated with drug dealers, you know crack/cocaine stuff like that
meaning due to the laws we have on crack/cocaine and regular cocaine
police are only, I don't want to say only right, but shit
only logic by riding around in the hood all day
and not in the suburbs
because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood
and you know the other thing is mostly found in you know where I'm going
but why bring a motherfucker to jail if it's not gonna stand up in court
cuz this drug ain't that drug, you know level 3, level 4 drug, shit like that
I guess it's all a misunderstanding
I sit back and think, you know us young motherfuckers you know that 1 in 9
we probably only selling the crack cocaine because we in the hood
and it's not like in the suburbs, we don't have what you have
why? I really don't wanna know the answer
I guess we just misunderstood huh
you know we don't have room in the jail now
for the real motherfuckers, the real criminals
sex offenders, rapists serial killers
don't get scared, don't get scared
I know you saw one them sex offenders papers
don't trip he live right on the end of yo block
Mhm yea, that nigga live right down the street from you
sex offender on the level 3 drug
convicted ex-con
yea check em out
watch you got, you got a daughter, son, what you got?
haha yea, you know what
that's the good weed
you know what, I have a fucking daughter
you understand me and why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail
just because the reason why he live next door to me
ain't the reason I live next door to him
Meaning he didn't wrap his way to my fucking neighborhood
he sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood
you move him out bring him to jail for life
and then you move in with a sex offender
ahaha, hey give me a paper
ahaha is that a misunderstanding because I didn't understand it
another thing, let me take my glasses off
cause I wanna see the reaction on there faces when I say this
ha-ha, uh Mr  Al Sharpton
here is why I don't respect you and nobody like ya
see you're the type that gets off on getting on other people
that's not good, no homo
rather unhuman, I should say
I mean giving the fact that humanity were a good humanity
rather to me is helping one another
no matter your color or race
but this guy and people like him, they?d rather speculated before they inflamate
if that's a word, ha-hahaha you know spec before check
anyways meaning id much rather
you talk to me first and see if you can lend an opinion before you link one
just my thought of good humanity Mr  Sharpton
hold on I ain't finished with you man
na fuck that shit Mhm hold on, um
Mr  sharp ton and anyone like you, you don't know me
so if your not going to try to then what you say or think about me
are what ever I do is totally Casper the friendly ghost
to me and it doesn?t make you a good person to criticize before you improvise
doesn?t
necessarily make you a bad person either but the characteristics for
heavenly into bads way, ahaha but since I am human I am good and bad, as
well but I try my hardest to stay good
threes other things I do and say may be bad or just not to good
but I do try, so with that said I don't vote you, I mean your only human, good or bad
but I also don't respect you and I don't care if that's good or bad
see you are no MLK you are no Jesse Jackson, you are nobody, to me
your just another don king, with a perm, hahaha just a little more
political, and that just means you're a little unhuman
then use humans, and now let me be human and say
fuck Al Sharpton and anyone like him
fuck if you understand me
I love being misunderstood
haha why?
cause I live in the suburbs
but I come from the hood
Bring the hook in

Oh, no, no, I ain't runnin'
Now when I walk past
You might see an extra shadow
Angels on my shoulders
Are usin' me for a battle
Spiritual warfare, good versus evil
I even fought the demons as a semen
Yes I was brought there
Cursed ever since my day of birth
Got a Heaven-sent flow
Though, it's Hell on Earth Hell on Earth
So wit' that in mind, I don't live for Prada
I'm tryin'a stack n' mack, and got stigmata
Tryin'a get the same fan base as Big Poppa
Sometimes when I flow
They say the southern Big's popped up
They tell me "don't get mur'd, or get locked up"
But I'm from Holly Grove

So til' the day they drop my box, fuck

I can feel it in the air
The reaper's comin' slow

You might see me on the side of the road
Who knew this nigga could sing?
I asked the Lord to be my coat and umbrella
Cause outside it's rainin' cold
It's so cold
It's so cold America
I say, Miss America, Land of the Free
You ain't never do nothin'
For a brotha like me
You sold me a dream of forty acres and a mule
Then you turn that half-a-acre that I had, into a pool
You get up on the news, lyin' bout how the levy's broke

Flooded out engines, messed up suspensions

Hey baby look here, I got this new song I wrote
it's got that nice slow groove that everybody dancin to
and when I play it, it kinda remind me of me and you
I mean, there's one more thing I want to talk about
It's time for you to come home, everybody got their problems
I'm dealing with mine
I done gave up them narcotics, I'm a changed man
She loves me, she loves me not 
How many ways can I say I'm done fishin
You wanted the role, smash the audition
Havin a partner for a man in my position eliminates the cooks in the kitchen
Still I got a taste for that fast food, foreign cars, many women
And some say it's the life I was given
I say it don't matter if I work at Mickey D's
I still got a fix for what you got between ya knees
On a new broad, you still one to one
Every once in again I like havin some fun
No disrespect intended but what's done is done
Women steppin out for love, men do what to come
Not a playa like Pun, but when shorties get the grabbin on me
The last thought I get is Koobie run
To them girls wishin on a star that's will stun
But I gotta tell it like it is hun, one
She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go
But if you're thinkin of leaving you need to let me know
We better together then further apart, so darlin don't go breakin my heart
We was high school sweethearts, talkin since we was teens
Every morning, and every evening
Ten years later she eatin that mean cuisine
I'm on the field, straight gone of that creatine
In the NFL which mean Not For Long
City to city, all the groupies they hop along
Word get back to wifey, she like "Stop the song"
I'm takin the kids to my mommas, I'm out, I'm gone
Momma was like Baby now I hate to see your tears
But I've been with your daddy for 'bout 35 years
And in my day I had to turn a blind eye to cheating
But I ain't never had to wear no black eye from beatings
As long as he doing right, by you and your kids
How you gon expect that man not to be who he is
I ain't sayin that it's right but we often pay the price
Cause a womens life is love, a mans love is life
And he gon live it to the fullest, and I ain't tryna pull you down or sound like a broken record
But you should know by now that all niggaz is dogs
Better to have a rich pit then a broke german shepard
She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go
But if you're thinkin of leaving you need to let me know
We better together then further apart, so darlin don't go breakin my heart
I say I don't have nothin if I don't have you
Like Shadai, we got the sweetest taboo
And my game is skin deep, like your first tattoo
I gets all in ya head just like shampoo
I just wanna fuck with you like rude polices
I don't want a broken heart because I lose the pieces
Hey, girl don't play with my gangsta
And have the boy blue like a Texas Ranger
And I know cheaters never get crowned
So I play "fair" like roller coasters and clowns
You gotta hold ya soldier down
Even when the war is lookin it is right around the corner
And you don't want to leave me, believe me
Cause I could turn you on like a personal TV
It's young weezy, I know what ya thought
But I'm just here to play my part, so don't go breakin my heart
She say she love me, won't leave me, won't ever let me go
But if you're thinkin of leaving you need to let me know
We better together then further apart, so darlin don't go breakin my heart

And when I move, I move out with the raw
I move out with the squad
To his album we ride we so mob
I throw lives and lowest to live
For my loaf of bread the people's player
I did what the culture said
And I live by the coast of Nostre Cid
Fuck around I'll knock your shoulder from your head
Get it right I'm a soldier till I'm dead
This kid is white with buttonholes inside that bled
I'm pumping o's with lots of hay
I'm so high and really I don't even know why
And oh I just go buy a whole house
And lay my mat down lay her back down
But I never put my mack down
You see the thug in me
You know Weezy he the young son of Bubba-B
Buy my basketball shorts with a thunder B
If you want it then come to me
I'm right here
I'm G'd up
Only follow the code of the streets
Live bad to die good
Know how to move when hustling by the days with no food
But just so I can eat
And ain't it a bitch
And if you see me getting fat I'm probably getting rich
And you probably can see me for some crack before six
And after that it's all bricks
A fake and my palm is wrapped around this eight
And my arm because the dirty south is straight Vietnam
I skate with the bomb
I'm asking you don't play with me at all
Shots hit your ass and make three of y'all
It'll take three of y'all to fill one of my shoeprints
Cuz I did and do shit that's better than ne shit
Fit for two clips
Thekid is a nuisance
Awww man, hes inspire by his own gangsta music
And theBluerint
Cruising through stoop with theeelit

Ride 'till I die just because
Ride 'till I die piru

Young money is the label, let us in the door

Fuck wit my bloods, got blood on ya clothes
And I'm blooded Suwhoop snd I'm blooded Suwhoop
Once again it's on, yea I'm back in the booth
Stayin at the top like a tac in the roof
Still on these souls, like a mac in a suit
Still on my toes, not a crack in my shoe
Rappers talkin bout me, but I don't give a who
These niggas still lyin, I'm the motherfuckin truth
Talk tough, 'till I knock off ya couf
And I own my team, I'm like a malu
They hatin on me, I'm jus tryna be Weezy
Just like Young Jeezy, in the lime Lamborghini
Smoked out my mind baby now I'm seeing 3D
Dope boy fresh, from my fitted to my DC
All red, so these souls know who we be
We be's, bloods we B's
Pop pop flows, ya'll niggas sweet pea

Back CPR, bad bitch wanna bite back
Skittles on my wrist, yea nigga the bright pack

Niggas throwin darts, now we hit the bulls eye
Young money bitch, New Orleans Eastside
Been around the world, rep the same thang
Been around the world, it's the same game
B's up b's up, flame game
Blat blat blat blat, bang bang

So he popped an X pill, and didn't sleep all night
I aint worried bout you, I'm jus tryna do me
Last album did 2, I'm jus tryna do 3

So if they ever thought the South and the North was gonna collide
Guess what, we already did

Naw, I can't call it
More like a black Democrat runnin' 'em out of office
Young Barack Obama, I'm all for it
The Rock of Gibraltar has now fallen, on ya
I protect my land like a farmer
Pockets stay chubby like Tikara 
Or should I say fat like the Parkers
 Tote big guns like I'm still playin' Contra
Y'all washed up like money that's laundered
Y'all funny, I'm bonkers
Honest, girls strapped to my dick like a harness
Rock star, flier than an ostrich
And I cover east, west, north, south like a compass
I shall shine forever, never tarnish
Money buried behind my house like a garden
All green, my bank account's like a forest
I Can't Feel My Face is gettin' started
And Weezy is my accomplice, ya dig
A black activist like Sonny Carson
Stripes of a sergeant, salute me
And chicks, I get 'em high
Higher than turbulence is
White Phantom, lookin' so Fergielicious
I'm from the city of big drugs and murder victims
Its get rich, go to jail and be a murder victim
Now all y'all listen
If you can't take the heat, get out the kitchen
 I feel like a black Republican
Tote a MAC'n Republican
Act so southern n' die for my brethren
Money, money, money
Like money Mac and publishing
One life to live, never ask for a mulligan
Streets call but the heat make me feel covenant
Been done had cake day late like Anne Sullivan
Fly like an eagle but no I'm no Donovan
Boy you better go eat some soup with your mom n' them
And my mind is on another continent
I am real Cash Money, no counterfeit
I don't parkin' lot pimp I just politick
But I get all in her mouth like parlithins
New always represent it to the inner
Come from the city where the glitter don't glimmer
The sun don't shine and the guns don't sleep
Pick a nigga's ass up like he got somewhere to be
And we wanna let the world know
This is not a diss song either people
We don't diss them we dismiss 'em, ya dig
Recognize or step aside, ya dig
We let the music talk, Draught 3
And by the way, it's Santana, I'm back

I'm that convincing not invisible that mans invinsible
And advance a little due to the pine
My niggaz call me little Russell Crowe for my beautiful mind
And I let you do the time I do the crime
When the crowd call my name I bring my crew to the line
Nigga thats S Q  and we fine nigga thats S Q  and we firrin Nigga!
Ha! Wizzle F Baby fa ya muhfuckin neck nigga
Got Streets in da buildin Gotti in the buildin

I see you with your palms in your pants 
But me, me, see me, I got the world in my hands 
I make it spin on my finger 
I'm a critical thinker 
I'm a hell of a smoker, and a bit of a drinker 
I know your name, yeah 
Your name is unimportant
We in the belly of the beast 
And she thinkin bout abortion 
I woke up this morning, dick rock hard 
Ashed my blunt in my grammy award 
You can save your bullshit on your memory card 
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed 
Jumped on the celly, called Makaveli 
He says he was gravy, I say I was jelly 
Looked in the mirror, said "You's an ill nigga" 
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars 
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers 
I'm tryin to walk a straight line but the line crooked 
I'm shootin for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets 
Yeah, I bought a brand new attitude 
The haters music to my ears, I got my dancin shoes 
Sometimes we question shit that there is no answer to 
But I just built a house on "I don't give a fuck" avenue 
Down on the ceiling, lookin up at the bed 
Life is a gamble better check the point spread 
And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head 
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds 
Smokin on a hallelujah, thank you Jesus 
Help me focus on the future, and not the previous 
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason 
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon 
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees 
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed 
Livin in the glass, and everybody's lookin
But how can you get the picture, if you don't know who took it? 
This current affairs, but who the hell cares? 
Everybody's fightin over positions, musical chairs 
On the road to redemption, go on and use a few stairs 
I'm just fuckin ready so I come prepared 
And if I could sweat glare, the bombs burstin in air
Life is a roller coaster but still unfair
A blessing in disguise, its right before our eyes
But since it is in disguise, we don't know that its there
I know your name

Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar

Yeah, I got game like Stuart, Scott fresh out the ESPN shop
And when Sportscenter poppin e'rthing stopping
But you can't fool me I know what you watching
ME you watch ME, you watch ME
'Cause I BE Weezy
Must see TV, C3
Nigga that's ME and I'm ME
I'm ME times three
So retreat or suffer defeat
I'm back 3 Peat
Raj Smooth, the greatest DJ in the world
Yes! We about to say a prayer for all our loved ones
Anybody you lost put them on yo heart
cause this rap is real, light it up for 'em
Ya Know
I hope you ain't to tired to cry
And I hope you know you ain't never to live to die
Listen
I grew up where them people call them people on us
Think we slangin but we just got beepers on us
Grinding all day like we got sleep insomnia
Living like the videos write a treatment on us
Stuck in the hood like they poured cement on us
Ghetto bird still shitin on us
Government still quitting on us
Lost a few homies and the grief's still sitting on us
So we got they names written on us
White folks still spitting on us
And them bitch ass police k9's teeth still gritting on us
But we smoke ashes still getting on us
Older bitches still hitting on us
I remember well
BZ rolled a L, BZ ain't here
Where's BZ at? BZ got killed
And that was my nigga
I go way back with my nigga
But I know that's how it happened my nigga
Shit is much deeper then this rapping, My nigga
But know they all rappin, My niggas
So now I must make it happen
So I'm a play the captain
Sail boat flapping
My nigga
No fingers I'm snapping
Happy for my nigga lil Tagus
Cause even though we couldnt
The lord saved him
Last time we seen him was when Katrina hated
Shhh found his body like a month later
Rest in peace boy
He was a east boy
And so was Wessy West
He was a good nigga so I know he bless
And his daughter is a princess
This shit is harder than a bench press
But let me keep going
But I swear I got a lump in my throat
But I'm a keep on pumping the flow
So if I cry don't stop the beat
I feel like my heart just stopped the beat
My nigga lil Derek was quick to cop a key
Either that or load the gat and go pop a G
And because of that
He's just a name in a rhyme of mine
I pray his family in his momma's fine
So much shit, just sit on this mind to mine
I think about it all the time
I drink about it all the time
I smoke back to back
Cause if my thoughts got to me I'd be in this rap
Or I'll be in a can
Thank god I had dreams of being a man
And fuck a man with a badge
Cause he ain't shit to a man on the edge
The 5-0 killed Naudy, the good boy dead
Man you would've thought they killed cornbread
Shot him up face down on the lawn
Not to mention wit his handcuffs on
Not to mention they had plain clothes on
And the complaint goes on
But nobody do nothing about it
The jail house and the morgue is to fucking crowded
And hate is at an all time high
Everybody gotta hater like a fucking ipod
Shit and they tried to burn my Phantom up
But I got my gun licenses
I got my hammers up
I'm ready to shoot like a ca-me-ra
Stay still motherfucker
I'm a have to write my will this summer
Cause if they don't kill me
I'm a kill this summer
And you can put that on my late father
Or my grandfather Larry Balsock
The old man hustled till his heart stopped
And I know that my real pops had money
No bank account that brown paper bag money
Yea he might hit me off with a little brag money
But that nigga still wouldn't be a dad for me
But look how I turned out I hope he glad for me
But that's why when I see him I acts mad funny
Cause he a joke to me
Don't message, don't call
Don't talk to me
It's just me and my momma
How it suppose to be
And I make sure she paid like she wrote for me
And I know she gets all hope from me
And I don't never wanna see her mope for me
Hopefully!
But Truthfully
There is a day that's due for me
But we gone pray that it's as far as the future sees
You are listening to the future Weezy F  Baby  Amen
Rest in peace to my cousin Kim Carbo
my nigga Vick, Rest in my peace lil Harold
shoutout to my nigga Steve land rest in peace pimp

Look, look, look
A young nigga screamin fuck the world and let 'em die
Behind tints, tryna' duck the world and smokin rie
Got my bandanna 'round my head and pants to my feet
And got my eyes fire red and glock on my seat
I'm tryna' stay under intoxication
'Cause I lost my father, and got an order, plus I'm on probation
I'm drinkin liquor like it's water, gettin pissy drunk
And stayin away from them lil' broads that tryin to give me some
I keep a chopper in the trunk and my heat on my wasteline
Duckin the law, 'cause I ain't tryna' do no FED time
Sometimes I just wish I could be away
But I gotta take care of Janae and keep Macita straight
So I just maintain the struggle and I keep tryin
But how can I when my closest people keep dyin'
I ain't lyin that the law tryna' bust my clique
But I scream fuck the world man, I'm too young for this
Look, I don't cuss, but in this verse man fuck the world
I lost my father to a gun and made a little girl
And I'm still thuggin' wit' my niggas tryna' keep it real
And I'm still doin for my mother and I'm payin' bills
Give me a cigarette, my nerves bad
The FEDs said they heard that I know where them birds at
And my old lady say she saw me with anotha ????
And some a the boys shot up my block so now I gotta kill 'em
And teachers keep tellin' my momma that I'm gettin' worse
And now she trippin talkin 'bout I need to be in church
And my lil' girl whole family tryna' lie in court
Tryna' put me, a child, on child support
And whole family deny me of what I do 'cause I'm a 'thug and stuff'
Plus, my niggas keep fallin to them drugs and stuff
That dope got these niggas meltin away
Man they got clowns right around me, killin they self everyday
We keep fightin but they so strong
I know it's hard but don't give up baby hold on
Just keep ya fate, count blessings, and wodie keep ya trust
And grab ya nuts and let 'em know that we don't give a fuck
We don't give a fuck
I mean the world just ain't gon' never change
So I just keep my head up and my nuts, let 'em hang
Dawg I swear it's very rough out here for the youngstas
Like everybody against me 'cause I'm a young thug
Dear Rabbit, why they have to kill Rabbit?
But I'ma keep you alive, nigga, I'm Lil' Rabbit
That's why this lil' nigga be buggin like it's no tomorrow
I only can depend on macita and C-M-R
I try my best to make it through the night and live today
But I'm upset so I'm steady wipin' tears away
And police got me under surveilance when and wherever
Wreckin they brains, tryna' figure where I'm gettin that cheddar
I tell my family just leave me a-damn-lone
I can handle all a my business, this lil' man grown
But I try to forget about it and just stand strong
But if everythang was cool I wouldn't write this song
Fuck the world
Got a early call from Kisha, Kisha wanted me to meet her
She said she thought it was time to make the relationship get deeper
Said cool then I'm gon' beep ya
What would be a good time to reach ya
She said what about ten but l thought eleven would be sweeter
Cuz she wanted me to see her, said I needed a teaser
But shit who got the keys to my Beamer
I rolled me up a blunt and got the Crystal out the freezer
I hopped in the two seater, left Nae-Nae with Macita
Vroooom speed up run faster than a cheetah
Only thing on my mind is how l'm gone get all in this cheap slut
Should I use a rubber cause i heard she was a freak but
hey say she keep it cleaned up, but I don't want HIV bruh
I drop my top on da drop-top, her name's on my beeper
I called her on the Nokia
And told her come pick me up
As soon as I got in the house she got on her knees and grabbed my penis
Ate it up like some peanuts
I said oooohhhh Kisha
Chopped off like a millimeter
She drunk it like a 2 liter
She blow like a pro, oh no I got to keep her
Told her l'd be back about eleven I'm gone creep her
But don't go to sleep, I got some more meat to feed ya
Now I'm hot, I wonder what's up with Kisha tonight

For me to dip through, she said it's all gravy
First I got to get somebody to watch my baby
Baby it's all good, I'll be there in a minute
But she didn't know I knew Wayne was already hittin' it
Soon as I pull up I see my dog runnin out
He saw me peepin at him, but he didn't open his mouth
Soon as he pulled off
I knocked on the door
Sayin to myself look at this dog ass hoe

Say lil mama where you headed, she told me forget it
Hop in the back seat of my car and she spread it
Say baby slow down I don't wanna fuck ya first
I want you to suck on my dick until my nuts will burst
She was a fool with it
She said she had a good teacher she went to school with it
Cuz she knew what to do with it
I didn't want the bitch to have my car smellin
So I took her in the alley with some K Y Jelly
Pull your shorts and your draws down to your knees
Put the rubber on the dick handle that please
I hit it she sucked it
Hit it she sucked it and sucked it
I got tired of the pussy and mouth and I said fuck it
Hey hoe, I gotta ride
My baby moma beepin me and she stay way on the other side
I hit B G  on the celly
And told him that the bitch was all good up in the alley, 
not the telly
This hoe don't know I know she fucked three of my dogs
I caught her walkin out the alley down by the mall
She fucked Wayne, Juve, Turk, I know she ain't got no walls
But they told me she'd do a job on the balls
She provided the number later on gave her a call
Told her what I was thinkin and she was down with it all
Can't deny it she was a fool kept that dick standin tall
What she'll do a nigga, should be against the law
That's how Hot Boys play it when we finish we toss
Baby when you finish Manny Fresh down the hall
After this episode that hoe won't be able to walk
After two or three steps that hoe might fall
Now you know then Hot Boys sad ha

Tell them niggas no love lost cause I ain't got shit to lose
I told myself to save yourself cause I can't save you

Niggas ridin' off in Hummerslaughin', drinkin' Moette
You know me: Colleon, standin' four feet

See, these lil' boys, they ain't really up on my game
But once I run into that nigga playin' with Wayne, man
See, when I spin-a you bend then I be on you block
But when me jump out with the chop-chop, my nogga, you drop
Now where your niggas at, comradie? They not with you now

Now, is you 'bout what I'm 'bout?
If you 'bout what I'm 'bout, you 'bout drama
Thuggin' in broad day with four glocks, a knife, and a chopper

Original Hot Boyland-cruisin' with guns
I shall be the one who burn the block up
Never miss when I distribute anger up out my Cali'
Hundred shots automatic
Leave ya hopeless in the alley
Now, when a nigga runs up
If the nigga loveless like me would have his guns up
Just because of the simple fact that I'm a Hot Boy, 
 and got boys that got toys to stop noise
See, when me ride off in the Hummer, leave him set empty
Now him catch three 'cause him want beef
Now, me tried to tell the stupid boy, "Don't mess-a with me "
Now look at himopen up his casket and see
Click-clack my mack, twist my Philly cap to the back
Jump in the black and scream "war", and just "pow! pow!"
How you love me now?  With five barrels to your eye
The scene gets wild, and everybody gon' die
What the dillio? Fill a four-four clip
You'll get flipped for runnin' off at the lip
Who behind the gun slang,

 and twistin'?

Come splittin' when I spit
Them callin' me head busta, Cash Money nigga

I got her waitin' on me, she lookin' down the block
She see me walkin' up and she run to the mailbox
She say it feels she's up in a cell block
And I open her cell lock, I'm the Postman
Just come to make my mail drop, more masculine than him
I'm nastier than him, I'm passin' her and him
In something faster than them
And then he like, "Damn, there go that bastard again, he the Postman"
And she correct him, and I respect her
And he protect her, and she neglect him
And he caress her, and she molest me
He must be weak cuz me, I'm just the Postman
And when her man home, I'm the ghostman
Why you think she holdin that pillow close, man?
Why you think she wont open the bathroom door?
She's no whore, she want more of the Postman
Postman, Po-post, Po-post, Postman
So-o-o patiently, Postman
Girlfriend snatcher, I don't care if you're attached
If that's her, then that's her
And that's me to smash her
Now she hangin' up her high ass skirt, on the Postman
Hehe, yeah baby I got that comeback
I'm at your walls like a thumbtack
So Miss Humpback, I know what to do with all that
Fall back, I'll put you a sinner, in the Postman
That's big talk for a little guy
But I'm walkin' without reply
She got her legs up, she tryin' to walk in the sky
She callin' for God, and she callin' on I, she say Postman
I'm like, "Yeah baby, I'm right here baby
He's here baby!" She like, "Yeah baby!"
Heres a chain letter and some magazines
Keep it clean, he will never think it was the Postman
Postman, Po-post, Po-post, Postman
So-o-o patiently, Postman
Yeah, she love my gangsta, she feel my swagger
I'm there every week just to give her her package
I pick up her bills and I pick up her taxes
You might find a few stamps on your mattress from the Postman
She want young holly grove in a envelope
I'm her private note and you ain't gotta know
I'm her fantasy, she always got letters on the canopy
Waiting for the Postman
No postal service, I just got my social workin'
And your girl is lurkin', and this world is dirty
And your girl is nervous, to give me head in the convertible
I'm the Postman
Yeah, kind and curtious, she love that in me
She love me in her, and I love that plenty
It never fails, sorry homeboy
But you've got mail, I'm the Postman

Hat to the front

I'm stickin' to the script, tryna kick it like a punt
My life is like a movie and I do my own stunts
I'm the Birdman Jr , call me young Baby
Coulda been a killer but Cash Money saved me
Remember I was little but the cash money made me
Big dog bitch, no tramp, no lady
Young ass nigga had a thing for old ladies
But as I got older I began to like 'em younger
To heavens where I brung her, and when she was under
She said "Daddy they, daddy they, daddy they, daddy they
Daddy they can't do it like you can"
I get chips like Vegas and I am not a blue man
Too much ice on my wrist and now I got a blue hand
And if I sing Prostitute she gon' need some new pants
And if I sing Pussy Monster she gon' need a new man
Hello world, I would you all to meet me, her new man
I vow to stay on top of my Somers like Suzanne
And I hustle everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
Everyday I'm hustlin', fillin' up my cup again
With that purple stuff again, I can't get enough of it
Pay me in the direction of a swisher and I'm stuffin' it
With that purple stuff again, I'm on some same color shit
After you do Wayne, it's time to do Wayne's brothers bitch
I get money like a fuckin' Wayans brother bitch
I get good with Gorillas and stay away from the rattlesnakes
And the jakes, and the fake, and the hate
Interstate 10, no cops in sight
And I'm coming back with a whole flock tonight
Lord, don't let me get stopped tonight
Or I'ma have to shoot it out with the cops tonight
I swear, and tell the jack boys not tonight
Cause I ain't 'N Sync but I will Pop tonight
Yeah, that's right, if you ain't got that price
Then go that-a-way, not a way we can even negotiate
Big money heavyweight, on my way to Heaven's Gate
So if that be them open gates, flow so appropriate
Don't associate me with the bullshit
One wish, I wish a motherfucker would trip
Like a engine, I come from under the hood bitch
But now a nigga gettin' paper like a booklet
They ain't help me with it, but I took it
And now they never get it, never get it, never get it, never get it
Never get it back, yeah that's my word
"Bling-Bling" in the dictionary, yeah that's my word
And for me Ja Rule made it just like Irv
Sometimes I still go through the hood just to kiss my curb
Cause I love that block nigga, Eagle and Apple
Old G's, young G's, leaders and barrels
But God found me like a needle in a barrel
And I'm so ready for war cause I'm a Jesus for the battle
Money on my mind, that's all I think of
Married to the game, never taking my ring off
M O B , yeah that's my theme song
Smokin' two L's, rockin' bells like ding-dong
haha, yeah I got my wings on
Flyer than the rest, I don't rest I keep going

Like anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway
Anyway it goes, I'ma get gold
And I could see the top the way I'm climbing this pole
A nigga with the flu ain't rhyming this cold
And nigga I'm hotter than a "fire in the hole"
Steppin' out my shower like a lion in a robe
Eyin' these hoes, iron in my hol-ster
Surp, purp, sure
Let's elevate and get away, accelerate and never hate
Dedicate this, to the blue eyes and blonde hair
I'm on top of my green like a lawn chair
Don't worry, I'm straight like arm hair
Don't worry, I'm straight like combed hair
This world fucked my Pops and I was born here
From the cell to a jet, call it Con-Air

"Love her like "
Oh yes I love her like Egyptian
Want a description? Her body's sickening
I can be her prescription, I can be her physician
Sexual healing, I can be her religion
And now she's kneeling, praying to the ceiling
I bless her as if she sneezed, must be the weather
I dress her, I am her sleeves, I am her feathers
She's fly, flyer than you, flyer than me
I love her, she loves me too, I love her three -
Times, more than her mom, time will tell that I'm the nigga
That she should, we should, be wherever she wanna
Be on a late night, mid day, AM
Just say when, and I know I be with cavemen
But nevermind them
She's poison and I am Michael Bivins
See I know that y'all don't hear mebut she does, we does
What grown folk do when they had too much to drink and I think
We done had to much too drink and 
"Oh yes I love her like "
Pussy, Money, Weed
Oh yes I love her like I ought to
I see you with my daughter, or sonmore than one
Maybe five like the Jacksons, or John Paxson
Just don't let 'em fuck up the mansion, and daddy will be home
Later on, smelling like the cologne that I put on
This morn, and I hope that you smell like woman soap
And shampoo, and lotion, and perfume, and candles
And I'ma run through that pussy like a vandal, yes
I'm nasty as a Scorpio but I'm a lucky Libra
Got her wet like she's sweating out a fever, wow
Leave her, to me and she'll be smiling every single time
You see herfrom e-ar to e-ar
I wanna be beside her when she sleep and she lay
Or we can stay awake and watch the next day
Clothes are overrated, panties are debated
Einsteinher head is the greatest
Oh yes I love her like her dad told her no man would ever love her
Oh and I better be the only man sticking it
Licking it like an envelope, mailing it, sealing it
Read it, I have written down Victoria's secret
Don't tell nobody, don't share your body with nobody
Not even a finger, I will cut it off and let him keep it
Now that's for Weezy, baby and at my station
We have sex orientation
When I hit it, she squint like them orient Asians
I do me, I say hey miss Chung Lee I like to see your booty
Roll like sushi, I'm trynna dip my celery up in her blue cheese
Ah's, ooh wee's, wa la's, tah da's
Mhm's, uh huh's, oh yeah's, never oh no's
Until I have to go, and then itsnever oh no

And when she butt naked she dress to kill
I never felt better, Never have, Never will, Holla
I mean all I see is money, I got a C-Note between my eyes, Its Real
Please feel me, Sqad Up nigga, For Real
I'ma dig deep folk, Dig deep dogg, Its Real
Now listen, Now what you is?
I am what you call a survivor, like trouble with drama
But I recover with power, and love it with honor
Discovered as a son of a problem
Remember smugglin powder throught the doors of my high school
To force up they nostril, 'til it got full
But now they pop for a pill
Lil one here's what's up, Drugs could kill
But drugs could heal
If ya, ahh, ill for that good feel
And it feels good when them fields pull
We wheels quarters through the real raw parts of the streets
My hearts in the streets, So watch what ya step
When ya run from the gunfire of Glocks and Tech's
Specials and Pumps, Vests is for chumps
Eat ya chests for lunch, munch
Young country dude, hunt ya down with tools
Repsect my presence, I step with weapons
You fall in seconds

You can't tell me you don't remember those nights
And if I would cry, then you would cry twice
To me you are the brightest star and the sunlight

You were cookin dinner, I was such a sinner
But the Lord is a forgiver, you know they say if you pray
then you can get your blessings harder than delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me

I know your daughter will be so amazin like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me
And let me say please don't worry about the women I've been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream, DAMN

Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth motherfucker

Uhh, I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I-I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside
So I could
I'm gone I'm gone, I'm gone
It hurts but I never show, this pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove I just stand up and scream fuck 'em all
Man it feels like these walls are closin in, this roof is cavin in
Up it's time to raise it then, your days are numbered like pagers and
My book of rhymes got 'em cookin boy, this crooked mind of mines 
got 'em all shook and scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin clock I took the time
And I, came up from behind and pretty much snuck up and butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up, fuck this fame that ain't what
I came to claim but the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another I'ma make these fuckin haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my words so your fuckin heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently bitch it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah prepare to die!
My head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, incredible, hoe you're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin head'll spin dawg
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives
I'll fuckin
I'm gone I'm gone, I'm gone

And how can I pray when I got nuttin to kneel on?

Right now I'm a million miles from home

Varsity's biggest fans

And I couldn't stop her

She had it all figured out
When she left me with a broken heart
Fucked around and turned me down
Cuz she didnt think I could play the part
But now the prom queen, the prom queen
Is cryin sitting outside of my door
See you never know how
How everything can turn around
They loved her fancy underwear
Every boyfriend, every year
She can't keep a man who's tame
When they can hardly remember her name, haaa!

Just to make them laugh and treat her good
She finds herself alone
Askin herself, where did she go wrong?
She didn't realize
She chased the type of guys
Who don't believe in ties
Tryin to apologize
Never forget the day
She left and walked away
And I couldn't stop her

Fucked around and turned me down

And when I came, she caught me like the common cold

And understand the rap game is my court
So I shall walk and come forth like a Rockport
Or some sort of matchin' slippers or yacht shoes
See I don't cruise control I control the cruise
Yes I gets throat on a boat
And I vow to never fall like soap on a rope and
I got a lot of loot and I ain't lookin' for a lady
And you can never pay me I'm from Uptown baby

Let's go, nigga Where you at, Wheezy?
You liable to catch me speedin' up the six, or beatin' up a chick
or standin' over a stove, sweatin', heatin' up a brick
And we keep the hustlin' slick, and got clips like bananas
We twist the bandanas, and spit at niggas with cannons
We ran in habitats with masks and plastic gats
Stormin' through the house, screamin', "Where's this bastard's crack?!!"
I flash the mack in front of your gal and make her tell
Like, "Slut! Where's the yay, or I'ma pop one in your grill!"
It's Lil Wayne, niggablast and bang triggas
Pay with my change, then I'm gon' have to bang niggas
I bag the caine quicker, and sprinkle like rain, nigga
Flood the av quick with the quarters and halves, nigga
If you out, you can find me on the street with the work
If it's a drought, you can find me on the street with the work
Never slipI empty half a clip deep in your shirt
And put your whole clique deep in the dirt
Smell me?
Who wan' beef with 'em?
Who wan' creep with 'em?
And when it comes down to guns, nigga, I sleep with 'em
See, we can sweep with 'em 'cause it get deep with 'em
And when it comes down to drugs, I'm on the streets with 'em
Look
I'm the youngest Hot Boy on the field with heaters
Let my nine-millimeters kill your peoples
Bust up in your house and put the gun to lil' Renita
Give me the yay, or else I'ma put her in her sneakers
Wow wow, wow you can catch me in all black with no smile
Me, Turk, Geezy, and 'Nilechicka-POW!
How come these niggaz keep burnin the world?
and why the hell this nigga Wheezy keep firmin your girl?
Turnin the wheel on the orange and teal Bentley drop
Then I'ma put that up and hop in the van and hit your block
Tell your mom to get the cops cause y'all gon' need 'em
When you see them bullets that my glock pop, y'all gon' eat 'em
See this for all my niggaz in the pen, I hope for freedom
And this for all my niggaz buyin bricks, I got 'em cheaper
Keep a nigga quiet as a mouse when I come
Wayne #1 Hot Boy, hot as the sunya smell me?

Nasty case, nigga run up in your crib, crash the place
Mask the face, automatic attach to waist
You bastards play?  Then it get awful and bad
There will be no more walkin for dad, and it's off with your head
And they gon' either get it right, or they get it at night
And when they spit, it lick his ass twice like 20 dice
Henny and ice is what I prefer, but light on the rocks
I pack them clips tight on them glocks and light up your block
And if there's coke involved, then your throat's involved
I get the toaster and roll up and smoke most of y'all
Me and my nigga, Super Sosa, run up in your crib
while your grandma watchin Oprah, jag her up and rope her
If you wan' grudge, chances slim like Ethiopia
If you want drugs, I got more flavors than Fruitopia
Recognize it's real and nuttin udder than that
Cause one from the mac'll have blood coverin your back, ha?
Who wan' beef with 'em?
Who wan' creep with 'em?
'cause when it comes down to guns, nigga, I sleep with 'em
See, we can sweep with 'em 'cause it get deep with 'em
And when it comes down to drugs, I'm on the streets with 'em

White girls I video tape 'em and they enjoy it
They love it when everybody saw it, it's off the chain
High yellow Mexican bitches they all for brains
But watch them hoes that want the change, it's not a game
Or a short cuban hoe, with a fat ass though
Bet I'll treat the bitch just like Fidel Castro
Tell me what you like, let me tell you what I like
If you go on and break me off by the end of the night, 
you can ride with me
Cause I like ya Simmon's jeans, ain't tryin to make a love scene
Truly I just want you to break me off
Listen, listen, it's Weezy the hottest, drinkin Barcadis

Now throw ya ass around, and scream me name

I like a short thick broad, fat ass and shit
Like sassy, flip like Trina, "Da Baddest Bitch"
Matter of fact when I see her,  Pull  her  Over  like a cop
Juvey coulda "Backed It Up" and I'da "Dropped it Like It's Hot"
Ya heard me?!  What, haha
Haha, Unplugged

A bitch that take it from the back and make the Ugh Ugh sound
Now you can bounce slide drop, giddy up, giddy up
Now you can ride til you feel it get a nut, get a nut
Shake for ya hood, bounce for ya baby daddy
Twerk for that nigga got you pregnant in the Caddy
Slide with the KY, hold up, pause

My chick like to swallow, yo' chick like to spit
If yo' chick was my chick I'd still love that bitch
Hold up, wait a minute, chill out, stop

Yo mama loved a Tymer but now you welcome
You ok lil mama and I love that chick
But deep down inside I just love my dick
The block is hot, the cops is swarmin a neighborhood heavy
While niggas off in the neighborhood sellin, with penitentiary chances
The dope roped up in the cup of their pants
Fiends flock like ??? come get this candy
I got heroin in bundles, them Highland O's
Plus a cooked slab, chopped up, dimes is swoll
If I spot the laws comin, hey its time to roll
The first fell a Tuesday this month oh sweet thang
Plus it's a sweet day, me next score for three days
One time they say what you mean, I gets the green
Break up the block like Maurice Green, ya feel me?
In my predicament I'm guilty until proven innocent
Hustle ridiculous, I'm tryin to get this dope continuos
Ball til I fall, one thing, I ain't tryin to fall
Want everybody numb like ambasol
But he heard
There go them fuckin po-po's
And if you know like I know
You better get off the corner
I'm a young dog, wild and ecstatic, violent when passin
hem gangstas doin time in a parishment, role models
And keep ya cup, we drink whole bottles, and cuss at niggas
Like fuck that nigga, I let my pump subtract niggas
You beef with me I guarantee your mams be missin
With a note behind demandin three chickens or she gets it
Do not twist because lil man is trippin
They could have ya body in three different places
Ain't nothin gravy, but save it
Cause I'm a ride and hit the nigga street
Weezy go to war like Sadaam and Clinton disagree
While I'm shitty from the weed
Like were them bustas be
I promise ya never fuckin sleep, I clear the set
Come outside late at night to your surprise I'm here with Tecks
Two shots knock off the niggas necks, it's so realistic
So I hope ya get it, or else them shots poke ya fetti
Be on the block until them souljas hit it
That's when he heard
Blocka
Me come to tear your block up 
If you don't want no problems
You better get off the corner
All right, I cook it, cut it, ship and move it
I make a livin in this crooked public distributin
Just take a peek around, the hood is floodin, shit is in
The hottest D in town lookin for me hit me Tuesday, like after six
See I crack the bricks right down to Z's
Got pounds of trees, my blocks blazin qp's to ki's 
Gangin in the cheese, them bricks is comin
No droughts I don't sit on nothin
I don't believe I'm frontin
If I give you a dime, I leave with somethin
The big dog, Nigga I got the city under siege
And the law don't bother me, I give the pigs a couple of G's
Shit, I hustle strong to push this work through the streets
I'm tryin to deal with every nigga, and sell the birds up cheap
I'm greedy, if there's any money bein made from drugs I need it
Twenty bricks two weeks completed, you can't beat it
Whatever you want, holla at me when you need to get it
Does anybody else, I'll pay em a visit
That's when ya heard
Come here peeps
I'm hearin that you run these streets
You don't want beef
Then get off the corner
Uh oh, you better get off the corner, skirt
Blocka, you better get off the corner
Come here, you better get off the corner
Get off the corner, Get off the corner

Rabbit nigga, y'all excuse the expressions
What it be like up there baby boy, ay this here ya son hollerin at ya
I miss the shit out ya, it's hard to be without ya
But I know you watchin, peepin down on how I'm livin
Ay, tell Jesus I said thanks for the blessings he sendin
Please ask him to forgive me for the sins I commit 
Just let him know I'm still young and at risk
Say, I'll never forget the time that you caught me smokin herb in the house
I was dead wrong, I deserved to get out
But you just talked it over with my mom and got it situated in due time
Told me get the paper instead of high
So now I take that advice and shed light over my whole life dog
I wanted to be just like you my whole life dog
I can't believe them niggas stole ya, that shit's pain to me
But don't trip, I hold you down, you still remain through me
And dog I know I can't see you but I bet that you smilin
And I'm a make you even happier, I promise
I know you can't be close to my nigga, I know
But I know you watchin over me nigga, I know
But the shit's steady hurtin, burn deep
But it's alright dog, everything gon' be alright dog
I know you see my daughter growin up and bad as ever
But she cool 'cause she do whatever daddy tell her
And your wife, she's still the most wonderful woman
I just built her a new house, she ain't runnin from nothin
B and Slim, them niggas still love me like they own child
Ms  Rose nerves get bad, but still she gon' smile
And me I'm on some squad shit and some debate it
But I know they love it way more than they hate it
And I know you probably laughin at the way I treat these hoes and these 
bitches
I try love 'em, my BM be trippin
But Rabbit, you know one thing, I got the game from you, every perspective
That's why I keep the gun at close connection for protection
And you see I left school behind and chose CMB
It was impossible on the road every week, but I know enough
And I follow by everything you ever told me, think wisely
Watch over me my nigga, just guide me
I swear to you man, at some times I really wish I was with you
'Cause I get fed up with this life and I miss you
Somebody pass me a tissue, and let me wipe the tears from my eyes
Yeah, nigga I cried, it's 'cause I loved you dog
I promise I won't ever put nothin above you dog
So I live my life in dedication of you dog
I know you see me happy on the outside and hurt within
Make me wanna grab that gun and burst again
But I know they got a reason why I'm here
And I know they got a reason why you gone
And therefore, I'm succeedin on my own
But you ain't never left me, nigga, you still dwell in my heart
I can't forget you kept it real from the start
And until my last breath I exhale, I'm a keep you with me
And when we do meet again, I'm a keep you with me
And tell them niggas Pac, B I G  and Pun I said "thay's my peoples"
Watch over me nigga 'til I see you

Watch out! Watch out!
Dawg you gotta feel me on this one 
What it be like dawg, I'm on some some adope grown up type shit 
Look who I be around nigga, look who I been around nigga 
Geezy, Juve and Turk, B and Slim dawg pay attention dawg 
Age is nothin but some digits nigga trust me on this 
Cas I think I speak for every one when I say life is a bitch 
I ride D L into the C L Gun right in my grip 
I slip a clip in every rip , cas hatas likely to trip 
Come home to my future wife and every nite she'll flip 
She end up catchin rights to her lips behind diapers and shit 
But I like when we split drink henney without ice when I'm pissed 
Go to the club and start a fight thinkin I'm Tyson and shit 
But I'm a man so I'm here to handle my situtions correctly 
And i noI might be dumb but niggas gone definantly respect me 
But in the mean partner I'm fightin gun charges in court 
And in a couple of weeks our next tour about to start 
Its like i'm livin happy now 
except for the fact my daughter sayin I love you daddy now 
And that kinda juice me up and I smoke about 3 blunts 
and puff a cooler bust me up 
And say a prayer for everyday 
just so I get through the stuff but I be like 
Ahhhh man, it's complicated doin everythang on your own man
being responsible for everybody and yo own man 
and when u feel like everythang is goin wrong man
I'm gone stand cause I am a GROWN MAN 
I try to keep my head up, but I die to keep my bread up 
And usually I'm fed up thinkin everythang's a set up 
But I get up this stick out my chest and clutch on my nuts 
And i get hit up with all kinda stress 
And put up wit the stuff trust me it's tough 
But I mantain to climb through it all
And I still manage to be Lil Wayne therefore I shine and I ball 
And dawg I live for today and hope and pray that there's a tomorrow 
And I borrow confidence from out my heart when thangs get awfall 
And I'm walkin on the edge stuck without a solution 
and someway I still pick it out and shuffle to conclusion 
And I don't need nobody so keep yo advice and jus dom it 
Cas ya'll cats don't really no me ya'll jus no bout me 
So if my dawgs be on my side they keep me combile with spirit 
And plus I know my fathers watchin and my mother's the dearest 
And I ain't neva said they don't appreciate what I do 
But jus know if I wasn't a man I wouldn't make it through 
Who would have known that this was somthin that didn't turn out so hectic 
But I chose my own life so I gradually accept it
I'm influenced and effected by the way it became 
And I don't play with them at all so I don't say its a game 
And even though I grew up hard and I have gracefully change 
I'm always street so I'll forever be facin a change 
And I'll keep this thang brutained on the waist of my pants 
And I demand respect from all if not then I'm waisten a man 
And if I want it then I get and if I need it I have it 
Take care of my family first plus the liquor and weed is a habit 
And I'm so often I'm congratulated for the succeced at last 
But when they turn they back I just have Jesus leadin my path 
And I didn't ask for you to like me I don't care if you hate me 
But don't mistake me no otha man can neva make me or break me 
Now you faithfully inspired by the hood tell I'm gone 
And I dawg I do believe I'm grown 
so I'll be good on my own but I be like 
fading Believe Dat 
I roll with a bunch of untamed guerrillas, head bustas, and sharks

And in my hood the laws are scared of uswe are too terrible
If I live to be old, it's a miracle
'cause the way a nigga hatin' or bitch plottin', the shit's hysterical 
That's why I keep me two big guns on blast like a stereo
Come to your burial and kill anybody else who care for you
Don't blame me, society changed me
You haul white, you smash powder all night for the fast dollar
Cut off lights, we masked riders
The hood trash got us in a position we can't shake
With boys we can't break, and due to that you ain't safe, bitch

And we got Guns and Roses, Rolls Royces
Beefin' ain't fake, not to mention

To them dog hoes, nigga, we scream "fuck 'em all!"
I hustle hard in these city streets

Some of the, niggas that you run with are, suckas bruh
None of ya, won't leave, without some bullets up in ya
Niggas can't hold me down, wodie wild
Cuz all that they can hear is loud screamin' and explosive sounds
They show me how to cook that brown and rock that white
No school, put that book back down, pick up that knife
See that's the real reason I hate to be on tour
I'd rather be back on the block with a bird of that pure
Niggas got it all wrong, thinkin' I'm all song
But yall gon' twist it and end up all gone

Unlike no other, I'm real like bag 'Bauds

I sticks to what I love, and that's the street
And stay away from what I hate, and that's police
And I keep a trigga somewhere on me to start blowin'
And leave a nigga somewhere lonely with his heart showin'

Now when I crawl up out the Rove' I got quarters and O's
Forty-fours under my clothes, I'm drunk and blowed
And I done told them boys if they play I dump their mothers
Now they findin' niggas everyday slumped in gutters
I come through on the block strapped, bumpin' Bubba
for the summer in a bright orange pumpkin Hummer
Stumblin’ from the Courvoisier, and lots of hay
And make me run in your place and take your pops away
See, they got niggas in my hood who can't cop the yay
So I can get it understood and have you chopped today
And not to say I could even hit your block and spray
And try to knock all the bone structure out your face
Stick a potato on the head of my nine, it's deadly quiet
Leave a nigga redder than swine, you pig
The plan is to take everything and kill 'em all
Young or old, nigga, big or small
Ain't nothin' nice
Ain't nothin' nice around here, stupid
Keep playin', you won't see next year, stupid
And in the van there's a box in the back full of plenty of tools
And when you see me on the block, I come to give 'em the blues
Now we all do dumb things
Playin' with Wayne doesn't have to be one of 'em
I'll murder his father right in front of him
None of 'em are ready for the trouble I'm 'bout
Pull up in a bubble, hop out, then let a couple pop out
I got two double Desert Eagles, bustin' at your peoples
Cussin' at polices, and roughin' up your nieces
See me just off the meters 
Don't leave without the heaters
Believe this, my nina's got more shelves than Adidas
You see the slick jackin', believe it's glocks and millimeters
Run up on your family and pop your senioritas
A lot of Hennessy, just twist that lil' baby
Damn, them hollow tips just missed that lil' baby
This is definitely, step to me, get a hysterectomy
Technically I'll murder anyone who disrespectin' me
Seventeen Carollton, mess with me, I bury one
Three-eighty, I carry one
Come to kill up everyone
What!
Everybody freeze and drop when Lil Wheezy cock
And niggas be like Q-Tip 'cause they breath and stop
Believe or not, the ki's ten G's a wat
Until I die apple and Eagle that be's the block
And he's so hot that four hundred degrees the spot
And weed and vodk' got me wanna beat a cop
I grease the glock, the scope with the beam and dot
And I'm hangin' out the Beamer top releasin' shots
Follow me, everybody in the family die sourly
Niggas drop hourly ruinin' your economy
Liquor power me, now there's nothin' that can bother me
Creep up in your window while you're sleepin', take your child with me
I'm wild, and Wheezy more violent than Dennis Rodman
Slide up in a blue truck and shoot-up a whole lot of men
A lot of heat, a lot of fire, a blazer like Stoudamire
Ride around your neighborhood and you wake up with bodies by your house
Whaaat
You can find me on the corner with stones, quarters and zones
or dope and powder broke, and our sale's soap and flour
And most of our customers come up to us daily
Yet and still I cut this stuff crazya hustler, baby
What can I give you? I distribute ki's to the kings
and z's to the fiends, and ecstasy and weed to the teens
You need to see Wheezanything you like and I have 'em
From crack to Viagra, and Vicadins valiums
I'm the nigga they point to when you hit my av
So get all your money together, come and get my slabs
I get my cash, put some aside, and flip like half
And still enough for me to TV and deep-dish my Nav'
And you can tell the law that I say they can kiss my acid
For the white people,
when I get two bricks for ten, I know the right people
And I keep a nine on my waistline
And I'ma be right on the corner, wodieI'm gonna grind
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm tryin' to grind
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind
Nigga, y'all gon' respect Wheezy, or else the tec squeezin' shots
I have your chest steamin' hot, and your sis' screamin', "Stop!"
I hang out on the block, nigga, with rocks and weed
On the corner 'til the mornin', see the cops and flee
And if we beef, we don't beef long 'cause we gon' creep all night
So I hope you don't sleep all nightwe on your street all night
Say, aw aw, I don't want your boy to get me shoes
'cause I spit tools, and put him tissues in his shoes
And the bricks move every followin' week
So if you need to get it, too, then holla at megot powder or d
And I shower your streets until your av pass out
More bricks than “The Three Lil Pigs'” last house
Stack crack and lay back, and just laugh at droughts
And issue work for half and just grab that south
For real, niggaWheezy Whee tryin' to shine
From daybreak to nightfall I'm gon' grind
Tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"

Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind
Start from grams to ounces to quarters to halves to ki's
Takes seconds to minutes to hours to days and to weeks
Gotta grind, work, hustle, struggle, and get it
Gotta buy, cook it, cut it, sell it, and flip it
And I flight everyday and night from the corner to the avenue
And I'll sleep next week, man, I got yay, dope, and crack to move
Ask them dudes when Wheezy open shop, I ain't got a bag to lose
Especially if I don't like who sent 'em to me and I'ma tax a dude
Duck the Feds and drama like I duck my baby momma
Sometimes I play it sourwhat you thought was yay was flour
I pull whatever for the cheddarnigga gotta flash and floss
Drought come around, then it's jack the cost or jack the boss
Cock the gun, then I push rocks 'til I spot the sun
All day I hung the block, I see the cops and run
I'm tryin' to get rich 'cause I wan' shine
You can find me on the block, nigga, all the time
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine
Nigga, I'm on the grind
Let's get the pistols out the trunk, let's get ready to bust things
Leave a nigga block full of nothin' but guts, brains
Ain't no way, nowhere that these niggas could duck flames
My guns up for and tellin' all to suck Wayne
I'm runnin' with a clique that just be thuggin' heavy
Plus I'm runnin' in them bricks, cook it, cut it, sell it
One time for my daddy, Rabbit, up in Heaven
Ever since my nigga died I've been strapped up and ready
Come and get itit's Wheezy Whee, the hottest ever
Now this fella gon' get bullets inside his sweater
I'm just terror, or better yet, horror or drama
And tomorrow I'ma hit the block and barrow your momma
Beef with me, you're swimmin' in water with sharks and piranhas
Revolvers and choppers got all your partners callin' the coppers
And for the grand finale, I might pull up in a tan Denali
When I hop out, in my hand is a Calico sprayin' your family
Don't play with meI wish you would

Run in his home, start shootin', hit his son in the dome
Dummy, it's onain't gon' be no relaxin' and stuff

and passin' a bluntme circle once to see if he dead

On the back street of your block in the back seat

When I rush your front door, you get a few to your stomach
Hope they dress you up nice because your funeral Sunday
Nigga shouldn't've played toughwouldn't've got his head bust
Now your whole livin' room is full of pink and red stuff
Now you're gatted up, full of that vodka and weed added up
Fresh platted up, your T-shirt all tatted up
Crack in the tongue of my kicks
Plus I got a gun on my hip, and I'm runnin' the strip

And dead presidents act immortal but I know

Don't need sugar, I need cream, I'm dark and strong
The garbage man puttin' on cologne, aroma wrong
I'm on, I'm on, this that shit they didn't want
I act a ass and shit a skunk, I will, I won't
 Black  your  Eye  like will i am, you Willy Wonka
That's me in the Lam, I'm disappearin' like Jimmy Hoffa
AK-47 my business partner, business is swell
French kiss a bitch, she don't speak French, can't kiss and tell
I push his ass in the wishin' well then wish him well
Sippin' syrup like ginger ale but I'm the quickest snail
From here to Hell, I hear them hail, I give them hell
I'm spittin' hail, I'm Clinton, well I did inhale
These niggas frail, they Chip and Dale, they little girls
Watch me act a donkey then pin a tail, spit out your nails
Uhh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the holy shit, I'm God's manure
I know how to hack a jeweler ward and not computers
I meditate like a Buddhist, holy ramen noodles
And now you sleep, I'm inside your room wit' a lot of shooters
You wake up to this chopper tool, it's like "Cock-a-doodle"
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, glory unto you
Glorrry! Glory
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, my clothes and socks and shoes new
I been a boo-boo since ga-ga goo-goo and dada, FUBU
Make everybody that knew you boo-boo, I got them spooked too
I drive a neutral, shock the future like Dr  Luther
I'm not a chooser, your mom a cougar, I sock it to her
My cocaine white as a white beluga, I like bazookas
I'm high as lunar, I'm wilder than tigers, Nikes, Pumas
Woo! This that shit you didn't want me on
My weed louder than underarms and car alarms
Cheers, I said "Surprise" but couldn't party long
I got to get back to the grind and the drawin' board
But all this fuckin' artist drawin' is the art of war
These niggas' soft as  Teddy  bears, talk to Marky Mark
I wet your block, leave it a waterpark, broad or dark
I whip the work like tartar sauce, you want it hard or raw, huh?
Uhh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the shit, Porta-Potty Tunechi
Unload the Glock profusely, I'm soarin' out confusion
Your motor mouth keep vroomin', I'm goin' Tony Stewart
I'm on the fluid, I'm ruined, I'm cold as Boston Bruins
Lost in the shoo-shoo and who's who and I lost influence
Lost my point of view 'til I find a mirror, start talkin' to it
It told me the truth, it said I'm the shit and you party poopin', Lord
Glorrry! Oh, Lord
Am I talkin' crazy? Too much coffee maybe
I smell like money, I know broke niggas feel nauseated
The broads elated, my boys are faded, my car's the latest
My bars the greatest, they rated  X  like Marvel made it
She caught the babies, she barfed the babies, they orphans maybe
We got that white girl like in the 80s, that Marcia Brady
I  Dicked  Tracy like Warren Beatty, I'm warm as Haiti
I'm armed and lazy, I'm sprayin' until my arms is lazy
Pardon my mental, I'm higher than Continental
Went from flyin' cockroaches to flyin' without credentials
That's private, tell the pilot "Be quiet, we need our privacy"
Throw you off this bitch if you wired, justifiably
Hustle with a motive, you know this, I'm with my whoadies
No snakes, no rodents, no ad-libs, no chorus
No stress, no worries, took you to a respiratory
It's self-explanatory, the glory is mandatory, glory
Uhh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I can't hold this shit, my bowels looser
My towel's newer, my powder room is for powder users
You see rolled up dollar bills filled with snot and mucus
My tie is Lucas, my driver's crusin', my partner's ruthless
My flower's rootless, my pocket's roofless, she poppin' roofies
I'm not a student, I'm not assumin' I'm not a human
You are not immune to this kind of music, you got 'em, Tunechi
Glorrry! You got 'em, Tunechi, I got 'em
Glory, hallelujah
I got 'em

Throw dirt on my name, picture on a shirt instead of a frame

Them Xans got me walkin' 'round like a zombie

Cause I went from negative to positive and it's all"
 Good Times  like J J  and them

They talk about her shit, like they doing promotion for it
But she single, cause they never show devotion for it
She ain't never act too good for a nigga
But she losing faith, she don't see no good in these niggas
She like why I get treated bad, but be good to a nigga
You do bad, you lose, too bad, good for you nigga
It was
She went  Cee-Lo  with my Goodie Mob, yellin' out I fall better
Life is a gamble, I was good luck for the betters
Take a risk nigga, you gotta shoot to miss nigga
Time is golden like that Rollie on your wrist nigga
I hate when they gets figures then disfigured
And when niggas get salty, thinkin' that shits sugar
Huh, that's when good goes bad
That's when niggas who just came home, could go back
So let's keep the vibe right, keep the energy good
Them boys would sit you down player like a injury would
Then my niggas fuck with me before the Industry would
Ridin' 'til the wheels fall off and the engine no good

Stop face fightin' me, like ya face frighten' me

Can you be my B-A-B-Y?
I'll never call another lover mine
And why would I, and why should I
when I seen a lady tonight, with my good eye that I would try and make
mybabybaby
I was up in the club putting my hood high
When I saw you, and I stood by
Just lookin at your onion girl I could cry, and I could lie
I mean I could try and say you ain't sweep me off my feet
But only one thing could keep me off the street
and that's if you be my, B-A-B-Y
I can be why you always be fly
And I'm from B-Stuy, just like B I…G  was, that's how F-A-B does
We can sip something 'til we both be buzzed
In a V-dub and that's only be-cause
Need someone to be my baby
Kind of girl you find in the club rockin those baby Phat jeans
Gonna find someone to be my baby
I see some ladies tonight that should be having my baby, baby
After the baby talk, the goo goo ga ga
You like this, that, you do bla bla
Couple good jokes, a few brouhaha's, it's time to do you mama
First I'ma put you on your back
And make you scream out babyjust like I put you on the track
Then I'ma lay you on your side
And slowly stroke you while you telling me the way you feel inside
But my sex drive won't make me play you on the side
You know you get the keys any day you wanna ride
And my baby know how to start me up
You got the kind of kiss that'll speed a heartbeat up
And you got the kind of touch that'll gimme the chills
I ask you cuz I know you gonna gimme it real
It won't be fake, and don't we make a good couple
And won't we make a good…baby?
Ooh, if I seem just a bit taken, pardon me
But you're so amazing
I just want us to do this exclusively
Say you'll be my baby
My baby's the only one I bring to the villa
that can get the bling and the scrilla
Girl, I know you smooth enough to spring a chinchilla
and still take a sting of Tequila, the way you swing is a thriller
I'm watchin that like the boxing match in the ring of Manila
I wanna keep it comin like the singles of “Thriller”
I mean if you still uhmy B-A-B-Y
I try to play cool
Actin like what you do don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile I'm sittin at home, all alone
Tryin to keep myself from goin crazy
When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about
I want my baby back!  And I thought it would be easy
but it's hard for me to let you GO!
Baby don't go baby don't y'all know what this is
Now I'm better than your ex, gon' be better than your next
Baby Screwed Up so you better be from Tex-as
Can't seem to doubt that I creamed her out
Now you dream about how I turned Nieman out
Nothin to scream about just back your Beemer out
Pack it up in the trunk, go back to Kima house
Cause I can play cool, but I can't play fool
There's options in break up, you ever play pool?
Better do you cause I sure does me
And what your buzz be is only because of me
The wifey, hus-by, never was me
I does me, trust me
I don't wanna another you so I'ma slide yup
But I got another boo, on the side, bay-bay
I try to play cool
Actin like what you do don't phase me, don't phase me
Meanwhile I'm sittin at home, all alone
Tryin to keep myself from goin crazy
When I'm in the house, when I think about
When I see you out, when I hear about
I want my baby back! And I thought it would be easy
but it's hard for me to let you GO!
Baby don't go baby don't
Through the time I been alone, time I spent on phones
Know you ain't lettin them climb up in my throne
Now, baby that lime with that Patron
Have me talkin crazy, it's time to come on home
Now, I talk with someone above
It's okay to lose your pride over someone you love
Don't lose someone you love though over your pride
Stick wit'cha entree and get over your side
We break up to make up at Jacob's baby
Her parents fought too, I'm the makeup baby
Wake up baby, love'll have you open though
I mean you seen Tom Cruise on the Oprah show
So I just can't bet on the next hand
There's too much in this pot just to give to the next man
Now if you ain't never went through it you ain't really into it
The neck scratches show you I really been through it
Every other day I'm givin the love away
That's what your friend's sister or little brother say
If I'ma do somethin, it's the undercover way
When them hatin ass watchdogs look the other way
And others may not see that we need each other
But if we on the same page we can read each other
They should learn us, instead of try to turn us
Mr  and Ms  Smith, we both got the burnersUP!
If you love your baby then turn this up
Know we keep this hot like a Thermos cup
Relax, don't be tryin to perm us up
We already straightyesss
Fab we gon' have to make a dance to this song man!
Y'knahmean  ain't no WAY you can't dance on this
T-Pain!
I want my baby back! And I thought it would be easy
but it's hard for me to let you GO!
"All day" Just keeps callin me man
Just keeps callin me!
I'm back to do the thing
Now I'm back to do the thing
I'm back to do the thing
Back to do the thing
I feel like the ex-champ back in the title fight
The young contenders are lookin at me in idol light
Fresh taper, waves lookin tidal tight
Yea I'm in the building, like a Corey Lidal flight
I'm married to the streets, this is my recital right
I got the Phantom drop dressed up bridal white
Hehe, you know them doors are suicidal right?
Sorta like they slit your wrists when I'm tryin to sit your miss
Nigga picture this, like a Kodak moment
I'm off the bullshit, 'bout to go back on it
And I ain't hard to find, bet ya Lojack on it
Call it corn row roof, cause it go back don't it?
I gotta get it now, ain't no pinchin plan rappin
Fuck bein friends, save me the hand dappin
Understand captain, you'll be under land nappin
If you keep thinkin that it can't when it can happen
Ask Scarface, faster than a car chase
At ya grandma's place, lettin AR's waste
Sports Coupe, not too much car space
The trunk look like Desperados guitar case
If you say a thing wrong, I won't let it string long
All I gotta do is push the button like ding-dong
I don't play the back and forth game 'less it's ping-pong
Mike Tyson flow, so I ain't in the ring long
Nigga you ain't King Kong, thinkin that you bit shit
You gon have your man sick, someone sing his theme song
My nigga Freck plugged me in with this Beijing joint
So hot, she play Alaskan with a string thong
Real delicate, I just call her China Set
Fendi fur, Gucci gators, guess she like designer pets
She saw a few things, that get her vagina wet
SF, G4, and it's not a niners jet
But check the body drop, baby boy shittin
But it's just sittin, so it's like I made a potty stop
It's like karate chops, we be breakin bricks down
Cocaine tour, I been through six towns
Open with crack as the openin act
Heroin headliner, stage name China
What you call that?! That's what you call a trap star
I could get the kingpin charged for these rap bars
That's right nigga, we still do this shit
Man on the street tip too man, we touch things
Y'knahmean like the body shop we touch shit up man
Get this shit movin man, it's Loso
Big shout to that Street Fam, what it look like y'all?
What's goin on Brooklyn?
It's your boy, I'm back man
We got Brooklyn lookin better than ever now man
These niggaz can't fuck around man
I'm back to do the thing "DJ DRAMA!!"
You're all a bunch of fucking assholes
You know why?
Cause you don't got the guts to be what you want to be
Fabolous he doesn't have that problem
He always tells the truth
That's what it's all about?
That's what we work so hard for Fabolous?
So they can point their fucking fingers
and call me the fucking bad guy?
I guess I'm the bad guy
The fingers is pointing
Nigga, I don't go in no clubs without bringing my joint in
They be asking fellas why why?
It's cause the streets is watching
With an envious ear, jealous eye
You know how William H  Bonnie's rockin
I keep the home phone and two way contact to Johnny Cochran
Be the same dudes, testing your patience
In them hospitals, resting like patients, confessing to agents
You smell me, you gotta spray the Wesson like fragrance
And you pay your way out arrests and arraignments
These playas been playin' foul
And I done learned my lesson with flagrants
Nigga, this how I live it ain't just entertainment
I'm what they been trying to do, not do
I'm the kid, they been lying to you
You need people like me
I'm so F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S
Yeah, that's the bad guy
You need people like me
So you can point your fucking fingers
And say, "That's the bad guy "
So, what they make you?
Good?
Bitches think all they gotta do is say the child is Sports
Quit they job and live off the child support
How could you stand there, smile in court
I'ma just settle, fly back to them Cayman Isle resorts
You better sign a pre-nup
You catch me instead of 'it wasn't me'
I'm gonna say 'where you get a key from?'
I love the way your butt swishes
But non of these slut bitches
is worth me asking my doctor why my nuts itches
If they see how the Rolls Royce smell
All day I be emptying my in box and my whole voice mail
I'll be ready to light the weed and pull it
Now every chick want to make me come faster than a speeding bullet
But I ain't into coaching birds like Tony LaRussa
I done had the thickest chickens to the boniest roosters
Who have trouble getting the kid like me to spend
Ma you'll never see a bad guy like me again, for real
So say goodnight to the bad guy, come on
It's the last time you're gonna hear a bad guy ???
You better make way, it's a bad guy coming through
Come on
What type of bad guy give fellas dap, females hugs
I making my business, my kids won't have to retail drugs
I get threats over the two way from email thugs
I ride with ratchets, clips under the CL rugs
Think I'm liking you? Wrong
Cause even if I get locked
My money won't let me stay on Rikers too long
Case dismissed, the DA even liking the song
Right back to the P's, latest pair of Michael's shoes on
When you holla in the club it's cool
But don't change the subject fool
And start askin if I remember you from public school
You know I done heard dozens, of these birds buzzing
Talking 'bout I used to fuck with they 3rd cousin
FYI, stay the fuck from 'round me
guys who want to hear somebody stuck or clown me
I don't care what other haters do
But if you think I'm loved for saving you
Say goodnight to the bad guy
Whoever said to us
Now maybe you can buy yourself
one of them first class tickets to the Resurrection
Yeah, I'm a Ghetto Superstar nigga
Most niggas trying to get one chick, right?
I'm trying to get two
You know, two is always better than one, right?
I'm trying to kill two birds with one stone 
It's 151's prone, that have you and hun's stoned
Trying the unknown 
Doing things I know y'all parents wouldn't con-done
It's you, her and me  eyes too blurred to see
Speech too slurred to G
But you know "Young'n" would love ta
See ya upon each other, feeling on me while tongue'n each other
Wow! it's a wonderful thing 
To have a pretty female under each wing
The cake can prob'ly Pollie, both of these Bobby Darlies
That take off their Rockavalis?
My job is narly from getting slobbed on Harley's
Getting smoke from the supplier, robbin' Marley
I hope this ain't tooking wrong
But ma now I wanna see how both of y'all look in thongs
I got a bad bitch on my left side oww
Bad bitch on my right side okay

Cause I hold the record for the most Menage à Trois and lama taje
I got a bad chick on my left lap
Bad chick on my right lap
Do as I suggest, I confess
At my request they gon' get right
So when you see lipstick on both cheeks
That mean I slip dick in both freaks
They started calling me Two Time Johnny
After repeatedly leaving the club wit two mami's
This brother done had 'em
From close friends, the girls all know each other from Adam
I'm always this humble boo, HELL YES!
It's cool for your girlfriend to come through too
At the most it'll take an hour together
To get these girls from dancing wit each other
In to taking showers together
They know, it's a studio in Fab crib
One of y'all can rock the mic while the other one ad libs
Boo, my government is personal 
But I got enough sets of twins to make Doublemint commercials
After trying X, I can only imagine what y'all be trying next
The stacks that I be splurging have girls in the back of the Excursion
Forgetting bout the fact that they was virgins
I don't care who you bringing wit you
Just let her know that I'm poking her while I'm fingering you
I love that thing that you do
And I know about the tongue and nipple
But I ain't know you had a ring in it too
I can tell when they came, cause they start spelling my name
Like F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S oww
"Well in just about 15 seconds from now, it'll be 1990
We're gathered down below as we say goodbye to 1989
The ball is moving, the crowd sees it, you can hear 'emoh can you ever hear 'em
They know when it hits the bottom it'll be 1990  goodbye to the 80s "
"Happy new year!"
Change is good for everybody
Montana

When that hate don't work they start tellin' lies
Baby work, go on bust it wide
It's that new money, let the draws drop

And baby I could help your situation
No top, smokin' medication
This the New Year resolution
We gotta be the winners cause the rest is losin'
I told 'em get money, that's the best solution
When you do, wear your  Rocket  like you rest in Houston
When niggas stole my style, I ain't stress the boostin'
It's time to make more money, less excuses
My old bitch on death row, it's time for execution
My new bitch is  Bad Azz , she the best since Boosie
Twelve o'clock then the call drop
Cut them niggas off when the ball drop
Young boy, hard head in the soft top
Cause when them shots ain't ringin' you can't call shots ba ba ba!
Mix some white and brown on the corner strap
Might be the next Mike Brown where you rollin' at ba ba ba!
V with, hundred on the Lincoln
3 quarter mink blew the top off Lincoln, God haan!
Niggas scared to play it like jail or jail or Richard Mellor Mellor
I hope I never Tom Heller, God God

My right hand got 30 on his left arm bling!
On that left lane nigga, what a bitch for? haan!
And I just don't know why and I just don't know why
Whoa whoa whoa
Cuttin' off hoes when the ball drop
Ridin' with my woes 'til the casket drop

Shawty bag it up, let that ass drop
Mommy killin' em, tat a tear drop
Bitch I'm on fire, need to stop drop
Nigga this the flow that got your artist dropped
Heard he was a rat, heard he dime dropped
Hit 'em in the head, watch the body drop
Dollars comin' down like rain drops
New year, new money, nigga ball drop
This just feels, beautiful
Beauty's when you just got out the shower
Hair still drippin wrapped up in the towel
Beauty's when you ready in a hour
Them long legs I call them the Twin Towers
You put that arch in it, put that hand on 'yo hip
Put yo' hair in a bun, and you handle the shit
Beauty's when the strut compliments ass
You know yo' beauty look good with yo' confident ass
Shit! Straight up! But the rest work
You know it's beauty when her smile is her best curve
That's real beauty, no makeup shit

The Soul Tape shit, nuff to make shift
All natural, put it down, Young Ralph, let's get it
Beauty is knowin nobody real as you WOO!!!
Truly condolences for that pair of shoes
Killin the scene this type of love will make you complete
Now roll the weed and get the munchies she be in cuisine
I'm in her jeans and still in tuned with her inner being
Her inner thoughts her worst fears she give to me
Beauty is loyalty to the fullest
'Cause Cupid made me your target for she ever see the bullet
For she a get super deep maybe speed out before pull out 
If sex is a weapon, her beauty don't need a bullet
Beauty, is the beauty, that her mother gave her
May you be brought about God me and grandmama's angels
It's God given, never complicated
Alot of niggas talkin that don't got the heart to say it
Now I can tell you I see potential in how you do it
I pray you know your worth when niggas don't notice your beauty
Truly! Ralph!
You see beauty isn't rushed, it's a process 
Sometimes it's slow, yeah
I mean it's beauty in everything you know
You just gotta recognize it
Shoutout to the people who do, and I feel sorry for the people who don't
Niggas is tryin to eat, that's all I look at it as niggas wanna eat food
Niggas is tired of bein on the streets niggas is tired of robbin and stealin
Niggas is tired of sellin drugs, and tryin to get some money
Niggas is tired of bein on the corner fucked up
Rest in peace to the late great Christopher Wallace

So cold in my city, best believe that that heat's on
Bitch I'm tryna eat before it's rest in peace and my teeth stoned
Want my eggs scrambled hard with extra cheese and a t-bone
Got a recipe in these streets homes, taste the hustle, extra muscle
Make a mil' called success, now I ain't say you 'gon duck stress
I ain't say it don't come with pain, couple of losers 'gon come with gain
They ain't eatin got stomach pains they callin you but yo' number changed
Old friendships they strange, couple words might get exchanged
New niggas since diapers, oh well guess shit has changed

Look! I ain't grow up on Park Place, where I'm from it's a dark place
Hardly look on that bright side, mean skies be dark grey
In arcades get a narc case in the P A  arcade
Wasn't tryna be Scarface shit I just wanted the new Barkley's
If lil' fish get fed to sharks I'm tryin to see how that shark taste
Ask them with that shark face I'm tryna feel my park space
I'm tryna be in my dark shades on the parkay at the Barclays
I'm tryna get my money long,long as Eastern Parkway
Me and my niggas got reservations, no wait no hesitations
Non stop, to the money, that's my final destination
The judge looked at me, asked the same of me, what you tryna plea?
And I said B I T E 
Every single day, each and every night B I T E  
That's my word, I'm screamin B I T E , I'm screamin B I T E

Yea, Its bout to get real hard for these niggas to move man
Somebody get these niggas some wheelchairs or somethin
Goin to war is still a scary issue
But in my hood they train to kill wit every pistol
Like they military issue
Guess you a star if you sell a million every disc two
Catch a gun case and bounce and still they'll barely frisk you
Cuz, I proved I move the retail
Make the smoothest grooves wit female
And I remove the rules on V12's
You aint never seen it move this smooth on sprewell's
I'm a hustler, you just a middle man to me
The way I pass the rock could make Jason Kidd a fan of me
Just cop one joint, I'm a one point somethin
Still I'll have you at gunpoint, with one joint dumpin
So watch what you say to them crackers
Ill put a couple G's on yer head like you play for the Packers
I'm rap's Labron James, I quickly see baskets
These scrubs wouldn't make it to the Mickey-D's classics
You got some sticky weed? Pass it
If not put it out, im pushin it before they put it out
Wit the dash, wooded out, Shaq O'Neal footed out
Blastin a get it first, before they put it out, Clue!
Yea, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Maybe wouldn't be a million kids wit they faces on containers
If cops pursue the same way they chase us entertainers
In the hood, a few big faces and a chain a-
Get metal in ya mouth like braces and retainers
Even the young bucks be scheming on somebody change
Tryin a sell somebody 'cain, before they even potty trained
You can smooth talk your way into a hottie brain
Have her suckin long enough to leave a nigga body drained
I wasn't taught, I learned from watchin stupid people
That'll run up shootin, in front of a group of people
I lay in a cut, the same way the troopers peep you
Ride up on yer coupe and creep you while you let a groupie deep you
Cuz even if you reppin like a man of skill
You gon' still need a weapon when you layin a deal
One for watch you slippin like you steppin banana pills
Think a nigga ain't gon' pull a weapon cuz you scanned a mil?
I crept in and got handed meals
Now the white and black rides look like salt and pepper on the bannon grill
Think I wouldn't hold a Pepsi in my hand for mils?
You must be fuckin stupid, nigga
R I P  to the competion
Black City bitch, Black Black City bitch
That girl bust it like the New Jack City bitch

Tonight they lost four Lakers, ask Walt Frazier

Monogramed out son in case you didn't know so
Flow so deadly, swag too murderous
Known for bein nice, that don't mean courteous

One and then the two 
Two and then the three 
Three and then the four 
Then you gotta BREATHE 
One and then the two 
Two and then the three 
Three and then the four 
Then you gotta BREATHE 
Then you gotta gasp
Then you gotta gasp
Yo these niggaz can't breathe when I come through, hum too 
Some shoes, gotta be 20 man 
It's not even funny they can't BREATHE 
The choke holds too tight 
The left looks too right 
You know what? You right 
These bitches can't BREATHE 
Look look, they hearts racin'
They start chasin'
But I'm so fast when I blow past
That they can't BREATHE 
In the presence of the man 
Your future looks better than ya past if you present with the man 
You betta BREATHE 
You niggaz can't share my air 
Or walk a mile in the pair I wear 
And I'm gettin better year by year 
Like they say wine do 
Cops couldn't smell me if you brought the canines through 
And I pace myself 
I know these money hungry bitches wanna taste my wealth 
But I keep em' on a diet 
Embrace they health 
Or either keep em' on a quiet 
And space myself 
And just take a deep breath 
I got em' grabbin' they chest 
Cuz it's hurtin' em' to see Fab in his best 
And they in they worst 
They rather see me lay in the hearse than lay in the back
And I ain't just layin a verse 
I'm sayin the facts 
I came back with some sicka stones 
That got these broke niggaz lookin at me like they chokin' on a chicken bone 
Every chick I bone 
Can't leave the dick alone 
So I know 
It's one of them everytime I flip my phone 
I see em on the block when I passes 
Lookin like they need oxygen mask-es 
I make it hard to BREATHE 
But I keep the glocks in the stashes 
Cuz the cops wanna lock and harass us 
And make it hard to BREATHE 
They has to react 
Like havin' a asthma attack 
When they see the plasma in back 
You dudes are wheezin' behind me 
My flow is like a coupe, breezin at 90 
That's the reason they signed me 
It's quick metaphors and hard punches on the cuts 
Feels somethin' like hard punches to the gut 
How I address the haters and under estimaters 
And ride up on them like they escalators 
They shook up and hooked up to respirators 
On they last breath talking to investigators 
I'm a breath of fresh air 
And a fresh pair 
Face it boo and do it till your face get blue 
And then BREATHE 
When the crew walk in it 
Pop a few corks in it 
As quick as a tick in a New York minute 
Catch a breath, fore u catch a left 
Even worse, catch a Tef 
Only way u catch a F 
To the A-B, its in the maybe 
Rollin with my baby 
Grippin on a toy that you won't find in  KayBee  
I rhyme slick on ya 
I'm a have to put the Heimlich on ya 
What you know bout lettin' dimes lick on ya?
While you inhale the weed 
And it won't stop till they inhale ya seed
And it don't stop I tell em' to breathe 
Like a doctor with a stethoscope 
I don't see no fuckin hope 
Unless these motherfuckers BREATHE 
Yeah, Brooklyn gotta
Uptown gotta
the Bronx gotta
Queens gotta
Staten Isle gotta
You niggas gotta
You bitches gotta
Everybody BREATHE 
One and then the two 
Two and then the three 
Three and then the four 
Then you gotta
BREATHE
Aiyyo Drama this the first
This the first time you had a nigga from Brooklyn
I think with a gangsta grill man
And I-I-I, I just wanna
I-I just wanna say thank you man
for takin Brooklyn down bottom y'knahmsayin?
Lettin niggaz see what's goin on man
I know niggaz heard a lot about Brooklyn
They heard about Big, they heard about Jay
But Brooklyn's still comin nigga, we still comin
There's a lot of niggaz, y'knahmean? Brooklyn is one of the
hungriest places in this muh'fuckin planet
We walk around with our ribs touchin nigga
I'm still touchine'rywhere I walk
Ha ha ha ha ha
See ma, I think you took it 
I think you took it wrong like
You got it misunderstood or something
You got it confused
I'm thinking about the one night we have spent together
I mean, when was this ma?
That I'd cherish the love I thought would last forever
I never said that, I never said forever
Call meee Na, I don't do this  You already knew this, ma we been thru this
Call meee Na, I can't do that, once I done blew that  Ma, we been thru that
Girl, that was a one night fling
You was turned on by the moonshine and the sunlight bling
You kept licking your tongue at me, knowing how quick that this young'n be
To pull out his dick from his dungarees
Besides, we had enough liquor and jungle trees 
That both of us woulda got sick or had lung disease
I remember every gesture made 
During the escapade 
In the back of the Escalade whoa 
When it come to tricks, I have some up my sleeve 
But Shorty dived in head first and didn't come up to breathe shit
I usually don't get to rag em 
But it's so real, I made the caddy chauffer hop out and get the magnums
We getting close the Park of Meridian  
She pulling her skirt down 
And tucking her titties in 
I'm walking this biddy in 
Caressing her pretty skin 
She said "I love the video that you and P  Diddy in" yeah right
I'm thinking about the one night we have spent together
That I'd cherish the love I thought would last forever
Call meee Na, I don't do this  You already knew this, Ma we been thru this
Call meee Na, I can't do that, once I done blew that  Ma we been thru that
This girl hobby was to slob me down 
Got me walking wobbly thru the lobby lounge ohh
In the pent house blasting Mobb Deep and some Bobby Brown 
Do not disturb sign probably woulda not be found 
If theres one thing I'm giving her, it gotta be back shots 
She screaming like she just won the lottery jack pot ahhh 
At the same time she jerking and wiggling 
Smirking and giggling ha ha ha
Cuz I'm like Dirk when I'm digging in 
The way she working and figuring
She must have be a gymnast 
Cuz the positions wasn't hurting her ligaments 
Ma I know you got centerfold measurement features 
But after a nut, it was a pleasure to meet ya 
Get ya under and outta wear 
You aint gotta go home, but you gotta get outta here
So write your number on this paper 
I might wanna scrape ya 
Next year when I go on TOUR 
I'm thinking about the one night we have spent together
That I'd cherish the love I thought would last forever
Call meee Na, I don't do this  You already knew this, ma we been thru this
Call meee Na, I can't do that, once I done blew that
Now I aint seen Shorty since the spot last summer
And she still calling and paging what the fuck
I don't even know how she got my numbers damn
But I been hiding 
Cuz, this girl looking for the kid like Bush was searching for Bin Laden damn
Before I didn't care if she where I be ut uh
But now I mean it be scaring me 
To get year of free therapy 
She said her heart broken  it caused her to start smoking uhhh
And the hours of deep thinking, making her keep drinking uhhh
Since Hiedi started stalking me 
I hadda get body guards to walk with me 
If you wanna get Fabolous, that's on you, that's on you okay
Long as you know they at on you I said okay
I'm looking at her ways and reactions 
Hoping that this don't turn into a fatal attraction ut uh
She screaming "fabolous give me one more chance
Fabolous give me one more chance" PLEASE?!
I'm thinking about the one night we have spent together
I mean, when was this ma?
That I'd cherish the love I thought would last forever
I never said that, I never said forever
Call meee Na, I don't do this  You already knew this, ma we been thru this
Call meee Na, I cant do that, once I done blew that  Ma we been thru that
Cuz now I ain't wit cha, know that I miss ya, some how I carry on
I can still picture, when I was wit cha like you was never gone
I remember the good times, all of the bad times
I dedicate this song, to my niggaz laid out, Til my niggaz lay down
Can Ya Hear Me, I know you hear me
Now we was once two niggaz of the same kind
Quick to holla at a bitch with the same lines
Quick to draw on a nigga with the same nines
But at the same time we was on some diffrent shit
Cuz you was with a bitch that I beg to differ wit
I told you sniff a bit and you could get a whif of it
But you kept a closed nose when it came to those hoes
And Im your nigga so I tried to smell em wrong for ya
Wasn't there to take the fault for ya, But if you hear me
I dedicate this song for ya, He was setup in a stick up
By a girl he used to pick up on the upper west side
I used to help him chop a brick up, They found him in his pickup
Pants down and dick up, Leanin with one in his head
And one in his chest, One of the best at this husslin' shit
But his downfall was that he put his trust in a bitch and it's fucked up
I remember selling three bricks of raw powder
Turn my man into a star in 24 hours
He didn't care spent the money in like 4 hours
on a Benz with like 400 and Horsepower
And a chain that had christ on it, a rollie with alot of Ice on it
A pinky ring with a price on it, when he come around
Its likely that he blunted
With a pretty lady in them Nikes that you wanted
It's well know he kept it on his hip like a cell phone
If you speak with him you can pick up on his jail tone
He used to say he wasn't going back without blowing back
and now I'm black I wouldn't put it past him
The D's would Harass him, til he finally blacked out
They told my nigga to freeze, but he still backed out
Shots fired 'til his trigger finger got tired
All the newspapers said was 'Another Nigga Dead'
And it's fucked up
You can catch me in a cherry red 8-50 nice ass
great titties, face pretty everybody know that she date smitty
A big time dealer thats doing a state biddin
who did more than his share of dirt in the world
enough to make a nigga think about hurtin' his girl
so he used to tell his queen to stay to the castle
away from the hassle to the day that he pass through
There's some enemies he might have who may wanna blast you
She stayed for a few years, that's until a few pairs
convinced her to come and hang out around New Year's
It's been awhile, you can see it in her smile
and she ran into her man's Co-Defendant in the trial
who started going on about how he moving on
about running with them same niggaz Smitty had warned about
She slid off told her girl, she had to drop her kid off
They found her in the parking lot, somebody blew her lid off
and it's fucked up
Baby girl
You know my situation
And sometimes I know you get impatient
But you don't put on a show to get ovations
Take it to court and go through litagations
And I respect you gangsta
Treat you like a princess
And put something on your neck to thank you
She's my pinch hitter
When the startin lineup ain't playin right
I come off the bench with her
It might sound like I'm gassin you
But it take time to get from the back seat to the passenger
We been creepin and sneakin
Just to keep it from leakin
We so deep in our freakin
That we don't sleep on the weekend
Wifey's a little bit uptight
Wonderin why I keep coming home in the middle of the night
It'll be alright if y'all bump heads it'll be a fight
But I said it'll be alright
I really wanna be with you be with you
But I gotta be real with you real with you
I can't leave you alone no
And I know I'll live in wrong
But I can't let you go
You're the one I want in my life want in my life
I already got a wife got a wife
I can't leave you alone no
And I know I'll live in wrong
But I can't let you go
You ain't never step out of line
Or get out a pocket
So I made sure canary sent out your locket
To protect you I'll get out and cock it
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket
Oh, you gone play dumb if cops do come through
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through
But I know the boutiques and the shops you run through
So I cop her one and cop you one too
You always get a daily page weekly ring
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger
Or worry about you tellin the whole world I'm your man while I spring her
At first you was somethin I denied
Something I would slide
Just to do somethin in the ride
But shorty, there's something you provide
Cause the entre ain't as good without somethin on the side you know?
Uh oh, I might be leavin the earth soon
My girl gone kill me if she smells the scent of your perfume
It's gonna be a clip tossed if I go back
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback
She won't care if I'm a platinum rapper
If she catch me with an empty Magnum wrapper
So keep it on the down low call the car celly
You seen what happened with Mr  Big and R Kelly uh
You know I care for you care for you
Anytime this chick is there for you there for you yea
These feelings I'm a share with you
Which makes it a little more clear for you
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Homie, I don't think you know me No
And I don't think I know you No
But this clip on the 16
You actin' like I can't let them Shorty!
I don't think you know me No
And I don't think I know you No
The way you shakin' that ass No, no, no
Now there's nothin' in this world that I can't get ya
I can't sweat ya, but I can't let ya
Don't get carried away, I just met ya
Or you can get carried away on that stretcher
And you respect this gangster
When you lookin' at this big diamonds and the
necklace, ain't ya?
Checking the 22s on the Lexus ain't ya?
Peepin' at them black air mex's ain't ya?
Friends would say I'm gassin' ya
Cause there ain't enough room in the coupe for more passengers
But while they feedin' and hatin'
We be leanin' and escapin'
Keep these beats circulating, but you mean I be thinking
Shorty's, a little bit too hype
But if a nigga give her anything
It will be the pipe, and it will be alright
Cause you know the kid will be the type
And do it like Lewinsky, beeyatch!
Homie, I don't think you know me No
And I don't think I know you No
But this clip on the 16
You actin' like I can't let them Shorty!
I don't think you know me No
And I don't think I know you No
But you lookin' so good
And that's just why I can't let them No
You will never step out of line and come out your face
Cause you don't want to see these guns come out the waist
It'll be weeks before your neck come out the brace
Months before the verdict come out the case
When I'm there, the hypno come out the case
Hip hop pops wait for me to come out the place
But you know whenever fellas go through
I'm in the platinum and yellow gold too
I'll always get them girls do the kinky things
When they see the size of the pinky ring
It looks like a bracelet on my finger
Wedding ring in my ear
Earrings on my neck, yeah what you expect
Nigga, I'm something like a pimp
Something about the limp
Before something like I'm pimp
Instead I'm something like a pimp
Cause every thirty days I'm pulling up with something with a tint
And I know something that you don't know
Can't nobody stop my nine
Can't nobody stop my shine
Can't nobody stop my grind
And I know something that you don't know
Can't nobody stop my flow
Can't nobody stop my glow
Can't nobody stop my dough
Uh oh, you might see me in Brooklyn
My heed is homie if you ever see me in Brooklyn
Cause my hat is on the top down when I go back
My bulletproof vest on under the throwback
I don't see no other platinum rappers doing good like me in the hood like me
But keep it in the stat for when they pull the rover
You heard what happened the last time they pull me over?
Y'all cant deny it, I'ma fuckin rider
You don't wanna fuck with me 
Got skills in the trunk with me ok
Switchin lanes, do a buck with me that's right
Y'all cant deny it, I'ma fuckin rider
You don't wanna bang with me 
And you know I brought my gang with me ok
Niggaz trip, I got my thang with me
Yo, if they want it, cowards get it
They still wonder how I did it
Now y'all wit it, these niggaz see how I spit it
Huh, these bitches see how I kit it
You can hear my coupe a block away
Bitches be yellin, "Let Me Ride" like they Snoop and Dr  Dre
I keep spittin, them clips copped on those calicos
Keep shittin, with ziplocks of that cali dro'
Keep hittin, and shift blocks for that cali dough
Keep gettin, my tip rocked by them cali hoes
It's William Bonnie, still the mamis
Dance closely, even though they feelin blinded
I ain't tryin to send police to ya rest
I'm tryin to put this, piece to ya chest
and you in piece wit the rest
You can release to the pressthis how G's ride
From the North to the South to the East to the West, let's go
Yo ma, I got you stuck off the realness
The name's Fabolous, you heard I be 
In them trucks wit the wheels glissed
In V I P, with buckets of chilled Cris'
'click, click', who the fuck wanna feel this
I still got them blocks movin, and the system in my truck
that can make it feel like the block's movin
My 6-4's, wit the wheels and the shocks movin
Them boys in blue with the shields and the glocks movin
You can't deny it I'm the same ol' G
The Guc' frames got the same gold G
Duke can you frame O-3, cause if you see me on ya corner wit a 40
It ain't gonna be named Olde E
I might be in Chuck T's, or the chuckers
And if you duck cheese I'ma fuck her, duck these motherfucker
Ghetto Fabolous, nigga I ride 'til I die
Hollerin 1-8-7 when I ride through the Stuy, fool
It ain't really dat hard, to get fucked up
Its really quite easy, just step up
I'ma knock him so hard, on his butt
Just like he been drinkin, like he drunk
The fat bitch stood up, just stood up
She bout to be steamin, turn it up
You wont hear a thang, know you won't
You too busy sleepin, won't wake up
You can't deny it
The kid pull the four out a little quicker
You might end up the reason, ya homies
will have to pour out a little liquor
Every stack that a draws out a little thicker
I get brain, kick the whores out a little quicker
You kids rap that's cool
But the kid's wrapped in jewels, the kid clapped that tool
Kidnap that fool, you don't wanna wake up gettin told
that ya kids trapped at school
When the time's right, I'ma put this nine right
to the left side of ya head, push ya mind right
It's still nothin but a G thang, I thought you knew
And I'm bout to do the numbers that they thought you do
Still don't know me, still jump in a Lex
The chain so icey, I got chill bumps on my neck
The NARCS heard, how the krills pump in the jet
Still bumpin ya dex, still dumpin the tec, still
That's right
You know what?
Everybody goes through some changes in life
Some poeple change for the better, some poeple change for the worse
But umm, some people need to make that change
You know what I mean? Change is good sometimes  You know?
Why would I change? I ain't never slide down a bad pole
Even though I'm certified over plat's sold
They say I'm different 'cuz I ride in a plat  Rolls
But every time, we gotta ride don't this cat roll?
I never snitch, and go and hide in a rat hole
And I aint givin' you nothing besides what this gat hold
No pride, I ain't that old
Cut off a few, but kept a few girls I decide like I'm ?????
It probably don't seem like a struggle
But I used to dream that this thug'll balance beams just to smuggle
It's funny same girls that didn't seem like they'd love you
Is beggin'for your autographs ands screamin' to hug you
It's crazy, same dudes that seem like they thug you
Is prayin' on your downfall, schemin' to mug you
And people that didn't give a fuck, is dreamin' to bug you
And goin through' extreme's just to plug you, who really changed?
This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you
If you've been real with me, I'm still real with you
If you got love for me, I still got love for you
If you down for me, then I'm still down for you
If you don't fuck with me, then I don't fuck with you
If you ain't cool with me, then I ain't cool with you
If you won't ride with me, then I won't ride for you
This game ain't change me, don't let it change you
Why would I change? I didn't step out of Superman's phone booth
To remind where I'm from, I look at my own tooth
I'm speakin' the known truth
I ain't been living the same, since I moved under Silvia Rone's roof
Why would I feel like I'm a stranger?
And why should I feel like I'm in danger?
And I'm grindin' 'till I'm right
Whether it's on the streets, or online tryna climb sites
I ain't blind from the limelite,
I had my mind and my rhymes right, and signed when the time's right
People shouldn't be hateful, they should be grateful
But fuck it, I guess I gotta keep my three eight full
I'm playin, the game, like I'm, supposed
Stayin, the same, like I'm, supposed
Ghetto Fab in da house, hip hop hustler
One million customers, and I still bust at ya
Why would I change when I get green like the Incredible Hulk?
I've chilled with the richest people to the ghettoest folks
Known a few and met a few locs
Made a few comments, and said a few jokes
But it's gettin' me sick, someone prescribe me some medicine
Before the fame, the vibe was way better then
Some have even became rivals instead of friends
Only two become liable for settlements
I grew up watchin the
Now they hate to see a nigga drivin' the better Benz
That's why the clubs be, deprivin' to let us in
They know the family bring knives and barettas in
I'm thankful for being allowed, fans for being the crowd
How could my head be in the clouds?
It's strange, what the fame'll do
But you know what? The only one who seen the change from the fame is you
I'm the same nigga man
Same nigga, that ridin' with you
Niggas that's fuckin' with you
I'm still fuckin' with you niggas
The same nigga, these hoe's ain't like
Now they on my dick right? Haha shit is crazy
Don't let this game change you nigga 
We never change over here
Street Fame, Konvict
If I'm your man, then you're my man
And we ain't gotta worry 'bout where we stand
But you crossed the man, you forced my hand
And changin who I am ain't part of my plan
Cause I will not change upchange upnooooooo
Said I will not change upchange upnooooooo
Now I don't know if I should hug him or slug him now
And I don't know if I should cap him or dap him now
But I know that it's feelin funny now
Maybe it's cause I'm gettin this money now
You see things ain't the same
I said things ain't the same nah
No, things ain't the same nah
And I know I ain't changed
Yo, I make the money, but don't let it make me
So even if I go broke nigga you couldn't break me
Watch how long it take me to jump back on my feet
Peep, quick is when the barrels jump back on the heat
Y'all don't wanna see me jump back in the street
So be happy that I rock them slumped back in the seats
Being broke is a joke, I never found it funny
That's why I count my blessings as much as I count my money
Some niggaz change when they get change, funny when they get money
Switch when they get rich, strayed when they got paid
Ha! But I stresses you to holla
Cause they never made bullet proof vest-es out of dollars
We never change, this is us every day
I call them boys up, they gon' bust every 'K
They ride high like them cust' Chevrolets
Like O-Wax for Kaine, lookin for his cousin killers
I got a dozen peelers for niggaz who doesn't feel us
I changed for a reason but homey it wasn't scrilla
They can't say that nuttin changed but my clothes
Oh, I'm lyin, I do change up my hoes
I pitch game you should see the change-up I throws
And gotta get 'em a ring to get 'em to swing
I'm a team player, if I win then we won
And they gon' put us all in the Hall of Fame when we done
Money can't buy happiness but it's a good down payment
I don't talk much, feel like I'm around agents
 the game ain't what it used to be
I'm the same but these lames ain't used to me
Them other niggaz, be full of theyselves
Get money and disappear, try to pull a Chappelle
WellI ain't hidin I'm ridin  I ain't duckin I'm buckin
I ain't hangin I'm bangin  I ain't willin I've done it
Brothers and sisters we're gathered here today
to listen to a young man that's on fiiya

These bitches get a one day rule
You gotta fuck be Monday, cool?
Or she gotta stroke a stick like the hun play pool
If not you gotta walk like a runway fool
Catch me in the moon shine or the sun ray jewels
If you keep sayin your prayers maybe one day you'll
be blessed like me 'til then keep stompin in your Air Force O-N-E-S Nikes
They should make scriptures wit my flows
I'm the young Bishop Don Juan that stripped ya for your hoes
So if I throw a dollar at ya scream Hallelujah
While I grab the neck of my robe and pop a collar to ya
Church
Now in this world that we live in, there's all kinds of pimps

Ya all-star pimps Pimps that
Pimps wit nothin but the Gators on ya feet Preach to em brother
Nice pimps, mean pimps
I feel like the angel of God
All I gotta do is drive the Range through and nod
It's like I was put here to put layers in the air
Put squares in my ear, put squares in the chair
Put pairs in the rear
I even put 20 inch footwear in my spare
Lord knows I gotta stay on them spinners
Dis verse is like grace that you say on your dinners
Girls come wit me knowin that they gonna be sinners
But, I'ma sense of relief
And I ain't never been a trick kinda like its against my belief
If she got it from me then I'm convinced she a theif
But they say God giveth and He taketh away
And I can do the same thing when I shake with the 'K
If a nigga make a mistake wit the pay, Goddamit
At the club I get right in
So if heaven got a ghetto I should fit right in
God loves me
Now just what kind of ho are you?
Are you a tough ho, or a soft ho? That's right
Are you a big ho, or a little ho? Lil' teenie weenie
A domestic ho, or an international ho?
A rich ho, or a broke ass ho?
Yea, me momma got my name from the Baptist who made
tha wrong moves wit the women and died for it
You make the wrong moves when you come and you try for it
New York City of God
I 'den saved some of New York's prettiest broads
I'm spittin the gospel
I hit my apostle's wit the coke that'll heal a sick
soon as it get in they nostrils
A Dros Trios, bring the organs on ya
A 40-Caliber'll turn ya to a organ donor
And a day or two, you'll be a morgue aroma
While I go city to city fillin the pieu's up
I ask God to forgive me while I'm fillin the Uz' up
Demons won't let me see a man fillin my shoes up
I ease 'em wit a sermon, but that ain't hard
When I'm in the Beamer before they released 'em to the Germans
You prolly got the man you love wit you
But wouldn't you rather have the Man above wit you?
Can I get an Amen
Now some of ya'll are pimps, And some of ya'll are hoes
But the restthe rest of ya'lldon't think I don't know
Ya just a haterThey hate what you got
They put a black eye on on the game whenever they play
They piss in the pool, And they fart on the elevator
Then look you in the face, Like they think you did it
They hate change They hate change
And they hate progress
They hate me and they hate you
They hate they own momma
Cuz they think its her fault that they ain't got shit
But I'm here to tell ya today
That if you a hater
Then you are the outter take or your own business Amen
And someody just put 25 dollars in the collection plate
So I'ma go up on the corner
And buy me a fish sandwich

Tha Reverend Charlie Brown
And don't you ever forget
Fabolous, Fabolous, Fabolous, Fabolous
Bitch ass motherfuckers
My cinnamon apple, you know you did me wrong
My cinnamon apple, said you know you did me wrong
Yeah, my cinnamon apple, you know you did me wrong
My cinnamon apple, said you know you did me wrong
Look, I wanna take y'all back to 7th grade, middle school
Skinny kid that everybody knew, I was a lil' cool
Had my, initial ring, gold chain, my lil' jewels
What was more than most had so I never got ridiculed
This was '89, matter fact it was '90
Crack was already huge, the streets start gettin' grimey
But I wasn't in that world then
I'm 13, all I'm thinkin' bout is Nike's, basketball and my girlfriend
Yeah, who at the time was Tia Williams
And she had no idea that one day I would see a million
This is a teenage love, few months but we was building
She was grown, I was the man but we was children
She had ass though, I mean for her age or whatever
She wore my ring sometimes like we engaged or whatever
And this the "No, you hang up first" dial tone era
Your mom's pick up and say "Hang up my house phone" era
And I hated that, how you gon' scream in my baby ear?
That pretty lil' brown skin girl with the baby hair
As we was goin' steady, my sex drive was so Andretti
She a virgin but I feel like it's time, I know she ready
He ain't got much experience but she don't know that
That boy's chance is comin' up, I hope he don't blow that
I'm waitin' for the opportunity, mama at work
Start with a kiss then I'm in her shirt, next I'm in her skirt
You know that always heard that the first time gonna hurt
That's what she heard from her cousin, 'lotta told her it doesn't
And so to me, it's just a matter of time
That Tia gon' give it up to me and that'll be mine
But one day I was absent, I came back to school
Learned that, I left the man but I came back the fool
They said that "Tia did some bullshit, I mean did y'all speak?
She cut school, lost her virginity, some kid named Khalif"
And I'm stuck, like what the fuck?
I ain't hear that my girl did what? But had to act like I ain't care
Felt like I wanted to cry, but nah I ain't tear
That first time I learned that trust ain't a must if I ain't there
And of course we broke up, she moved on, I did the same
I ended up with some next girl, forget her name
Which probably isn't right, cause we used to get along
But I remember Tia, cause she did me wrong
My cinnamon apple, you know you did me wrong
My cinnamon apple, said you know you did me wrong
Yeah, my cinnamon apple, you know you did me wrong
My cinnamon apple, said you know you did me wrong
Yeah, my cinnamon apple, you know you did me wrong
My cinnamon apple, yeah you know you did me wrong
And you gon' leave me, for some fuckin nigga?
Huh?! I thought you loved me!
You was supposed to be my cinnamon applemy cinnamon apple!

Wind up hook on machines, livin' like peas and carrots
Ya team wanna beef, thats when I screw the muzzle on the tip
And strap the beam underneath
When I ride through, ya dont see no lid
I put snipers on the roof like Nino did
All it takes is some c-note slid
To have you on the news askin if anyone seen yo' kid
I dont scream it in a rough tone

Every hustler on this planet ask

See I know all yays, we buy ours pure-yay
We waitin on boats, these guys go Broadway
Ya gon make me tie a bomb under ya Benz
See how much you talk wit firearms under ya chin
No you can't take the coupe wit dishes
Cause when I hit the highway, it always makes the troop suspicious
Please, I get my dollar from the hersey
I'm on that fly gangsta shit, I pop the collar on my jersey
You know I got the heat the way the Vanson is bendin
Same laid back flow, no dancin' or grinin'
Who else can it be spellin it at them
You have them tappin they friend like "I'm tellin you that's him", stupid
As we now give our final words
And lay the competition to rest
I just want you all to know
that you're in good hands
There's really no need to mourn
They weren't that good anyway
But I promise you if you leave the streets
in the hands of Fabolous a/k/a Funeral Fab
You will never have to worry about whack product again
And I guarantee
We will continue
to kill, the competition

The motto in my hood is "Do or Die", ho
That just means you do or you die, but you decide though
Writing shit about me? Now thats a suicide note
I should drive a black hearse, with a suicide do'
Nickname that shit "Coffin Car", but keep your room inside though
Lights on, day time, and I usually ride slow
We on that "Boys II Men", its so hard to say goodbye, "Flow"
Hop out in that all black, they like, "Who just died, bro?"
I say the competition, but they ain't look too surprised though
They be talkin sideways, keep that to a side note
An L A bitch, that ain't my fault, she wanna be crucified, yo

Wait, I ain't say that right He's just Niiiice

Lil rap bastards
Running round with your snapback caps backwards
Should be in rap caskets
Who you think showed them the go hard with stunting
And who you think showed 'em that those broads was nothing
And who you think showed 'em that those cars was something
And when fathers day came I got no card or nothing
So I ain't out here trying to expose frauds for nothing
And I ain't out here pulling these hoes cards for nothing
They was bitches on deck y'all, made 'em queens
Watching sports with a chick that got ball player dreams swish
I'm watching these dogs play with my old bones
I feel like niggaz done found one of my old phones
We in the house, y'all looking to hold loans
And when the market was up, you wouldn't have sold homes
So this the foreclosure of the wannabe
If you can't be yourself, then who you gonna be?
Dad to your swag, your style was like a son to me
Your stylist got thank yous, you never sent one to me
Lets pray for 'em
Y'all repeat this one with me
"now I lay me down to sleep, I pray for those who run with me
If I die before I wake, arrest the girl I brung with me
I give the Lord my swag to take whenever God is done with me"
I be saying to myself as I put on da gloves
It hurts when you gotta kill a nigga you love
Its painful when bestfriends become ya enemies
And you finding out that they not who they pretend to be wow
The whole time you conspired to put an end to me
And I'm still trying to show this nigga love, silly me
So I might shed tears as I put on my gloves
But I won't show emotions when I fill him with slugs
Cause niggaz die everyday here
And you can get hit picking ya seed up from daycare
Niggaz don't play fair
That's why I'm straightforward, fuck being all discrete
If I can knock 'em off quick, fuck beefing all for weeks
So we was up late night hunting, y'all was sleep
Cause we the wolves hiding in clothes, y'all the sheep
Who taught ya the game, who showed y'all the streets?
And who bought 'em them things they sold y'all for cheap?
And who came up the bill when them hoes called police?
Now you fronting so I gotta expose y'all to see
Ungrateful motherfucker, who fed you when you was hurting? me
Whenever drama came up, who was putting the work in? me
I was spitting live on hot 9
You was still rehearsing
Already my son and this was before I met you in person
So no matter how many colorful fake chains you purchase
Like that bullshit you wearing
You're always gonna b worthless
You just spit it, I lived it
Who's really writing the verses
Lose put em in the casket who you think driving the hearses
Diamonds on my chain! It ain't hard to tell!
I'm like ooh daddy, I see you with that thang'
Not my fault, I'm feelin' ya campaign
I like you but, I really like your chain!
It kinda explains the way she be actin'
She liked my necklace so she started relaxin'
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction!
Yo, you think you like me now, wait until the light hit me
I bet they house somebody girl spend the night with me
They gota love it, if not, then I guess they haters
This kinda necklace turn on the investigators
They ain't got one problem with this
Square facewatch lookin Sponge Bob on the wrist
One white, one gold, one nice, untold
You can look but don't touch, Guns might unload, now
I respect them thugs who get they jackin' on
But we squeeze set every slug that we be packin's long
Ya boy got the drug money we be stackin on
Lotta carrots, not the one's Bugs Bunny snackin' on
Got em, get em close and, lookin' like I scooped up-
the Titanic chain, from the bottom of the ocean
I play them diamonds well when I got dat jewelery on
And she called me Karat Jeter, maybe Canary Bonds
Ahh! My name is Weezy F Baby! Oww!
I usually don't do this, ha! Ok, I'm lyin'
Cuz these diamonds of mine, just sparkle like wine
I'm easy to find, In the darker night time
I get so much attention from ya' eyes, like signs
I'm, kushed out my mind, Patron shots with lime
My necklace is a crime
And that bitch fine, what that girl name
I call my jeweller over tell her  "Make that girl a chain!"
I take that girl to Spain, she can't pronounce a thang'
And she got her girlfriend on the side like fame
The fetish is Louiane, I'm bombin' like Hussein
But I'm that fire, now I swallow my Butane
Residin' on a plane, the sky is my domain
I'm in and out the country, passports, and sweat-shorts
And tanktops, and sweet thoughts, from sun shades, and private airports
And of course Watchu got boy, I got 
Yo, maybe it's them VV's, cuz' they sets Susters'
Sit on the next bus like that show on MTV
The waves on the chain, make a nigga fly like the wings on a plane
When you sittin in between 'em
Even when you clean em', Glitenin' when you see 'em
Beemin' through the tints when I'm sittin in the "Phenom"'
Oops! I mean Phantom, my words got tangled man
But this tiger striped watch'll make ya bitch a Bengals fan
We all know Jacob, check the shit he did
He spent more time, "Making The Band" than Diddy did
You feel my campaign, then drop your old spouse
I'm out in DC, at the "White and Gold House" White and Gold House 
Wanna convince me love, Secret Service meet with some of that Lewinsky love
She saw the chain, baby brain, no strain ever since
Now that's what the fuck I call a real "Chain of Events"! Nigga
Diamonds on my chain! It ain't hard to tell!
Shine bright like a diamond, shine bright like a diamond
I turn my dark secrets, into bright ideas
I used to cry for help, I learned to wipe my tears
I was scared to embrace but now I fight my fears
These hoes say I'm too much it's only right I share
Pressure makes diamonds, I was made to shine
When Life gave me lemons I made lemonade with mine
What's beef? Beef is when you make mistakes
Like less burgers with yo' buddies and mo' steaks with snakes
My story just gets better, when you get to the end
So when I'm at my worst, I know it's not the end
I came from the dirt made the cut in blue
So when you put me in that right light what I do?
Shine bright like a diamond, shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright like a diamond, shine bright like a diamond
I'm shinnin religiously, Jesus pieces and crosses
I paid for all of my toys I don't owe any Santa Claus's WORD!
I never finished school or completed no college courses NAH!
Was taught to be a winner but I learned more from my losses 
Losses like, when you go, is yo' friends 'gone miss you?
Was it 'cause you beneficial or you been official?
Condo at the top one floor down from heaven yo!
Hatin is beneath me, I say that's the devil yo!
I'm tryin to keep the faith Faith! Hangin there with hope Hope!
Until my jeweler bought myself two angels on a rope
I came from the dirt made the cut in blue
So when you put me in that right light what I do?
Shine bright like a diamond, shine bright like a diamond
Could say I always was the truth but that be lyin a little
You can't spell believe without a lie in the middle
I always say it first, niggas tryin to ditto
But I got bigger shit to do than to try and belittle 
Mind of a general, heart of a soldier
That just mean I call the shots but I ain't afraid to take a shot
Niggas gave it all they got still couldn't take my spot
Don't get yo' shorty got and have to live out take his plot
I ain't give a fuck now I would give whatever
You only live once but legacies live forever
I came from the dirt made the cut in blue
So when you put me in that right light what I do?
Shine bright like a diamond, shine bright like a diamond
Shine bright, tonight, you and I
We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Hello? What you doin tonight? Heh heh ha ha ha!

He knew it was goin' down when he flew me in 
Anything that I got on he wanna do me in 
Now all these non-discrete bitches wanna do me in 
Uhh, gold AP on me 
He know all his niggas wanna put the D on me 
Even Dr  Dre went and put the B on me 
But my pussy so exclusive, limited edition 
You know niggas love pretty bitches with ambition 
Bees on the keys, never go in the ignition 
B-b-but when I ride it, do it to precision
I could tell that he trippin', every time that it's slippin'
When he 'bout to come, I start to kiss his neck 
I let him score, but we ditch the ref' 
When we goin' out, we gotta ditch the press
Aww man, I got his bitch depressed 
Mm  I'ma call you big daddy and scream your name

So what you sayin'? I give it to you right, give it to you left
Keith Sweat, have you outta breath

You actin' like you never been downtown and shit

Buyin' him designer bags, one milli in my account
Yeah, no doubt
I'm the player that they're talkin' about
Got that good shit, even in a drought If you gon' do it, do it for real
And if they ask how I'm doin', tell 'em doin' it well
It's been a year and some change
And I've been hearin' some things
That there's some motherfuckers tryin' to be me
But ain't none of these motherfuckers tryin' to see me
So I won't stop, and I don't stop, yeah
It's like everywhere I look and everywhere I go
I'm hearin' muh'fucka's tryin'a steal my flow
But it ain't no thing cause see my nigga J O
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the do'
Now I done been so many places and seen so many faces
But none of these motherfuckers do it like me
Don't no motherfuckin' click do it like we
Guess I'm doin' the right thing like Spike Lee
See they talk like they some ho's, I walk like I'm supposed
But if they get in the way they get stepped on
It's the hundred-thou with the bling kept on
Dippin' on my semi-automatic weap-on
I ain't playin' no games, and I ain't sayin' no names
Nigga put the shoes on if they fit you
Well there's two things that I'm gon' admit to
That I won't stop, and I don't stop
It don't stop, it won't stop
I take whatever come wit the wealth, and even humble myself
But I ain't the kinda nigga you can style on
I got a coupe that I'm finna' put some miles on
And I ride on these niggaz wit a smile on
See I'm 'bout stackin' money but when they start actin' funny
I fall back and all a man do is laugh
I'm the kinda player that ain't gotta do the draft
Buncha hits, couple plaques nigga do the math
But a nigga must be gone for gettin' his hustle on
So I had to come through and take the corner back
And I'm back wit the rubber bands on a stack
Nigga quit or take what I give on a pack
Girls still think I'm fly
Blow kiss and wink the eye
And tell me they wanna go somewhere and freak off
I tell 'em I would love to stop and take the week off
But I won't stop, and I don't stop
I listen to niggaz flippin' my lines
And be grippin' my nine
Like niggaz flip and only spit game
Niggaz comin' at me tryin' to get names
Niggaz lookin like me tryin' to get fame
See first it didn't matter, and I was a little flattered
But now these young boys they gettin' too grown
Like I ain't show 'em how to rock jewels two toned
But it won't stop, and it don't stop
It's like everywhere I look and everywhere I go
I'm hearin' muh'fucka's tryin'a steal my flow
But it ain't no thing cause see my nigga J O 
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the do'
And the winner is
Street, d-d-d-damn!
This is a PSA, nigga I'm so fly
Walk through and get searched by the TSA
This is me I say, I love Mexican
I mean Gucci, green and red stripe me down
I feel Boosie, somebody "Wipe Me Down"
I shit loosely, hope y'all got a diaper 'round
Cause I, pull up to night clubs, shit beamin
Light fill up like bugs, and they schemin
as they should be, it's all good B
My money talks I don't think they understood me
Yeah, you niggaz don't speak guap-anese
Stoppin me, is like tryin to stop a sneeze
Gesundheit! I won't, the goons might
Get it poppin off like when a balloon's tight
Diamonds like sunshine, moonlight
Oh, you forgot who in the room right?
The Street Fam's in the building tonight
Whole other feeling, I'm feeling alive
You ain't even gotta bring your paper out
We the dope boys of the year, drinks are on the house
We in the house Street Fam's in the building tonight

You ain't even gotta bring your paper out
We the dope boys of the year, drinks are on the house
We in the house we in the house 
Look, I'm so sorry  if you don't like
what the boss say, you ain't got to stay Joe Torry
Call me big shot baby I'm so Hoary
Diamonds dancin, gettin they Omari-on
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I hope you bitches dress warm
It's like 30 degrees on my left arm
Below zero with the SS charm
Gestapo get the doors on the car pulled
I sips a spade, take a few cigar pulls
Bosses do V I P  never bar stools
Get money blow through it like nostrils
Smell me? That's green cologne
Accompanied by good weed and dro'
A pretty young thing that knows how to fuck me
Her sneaky-ass homegirl also wanna fuck me
And I'll fuck her
Damn Ma
I love you like a lie
I get a rush from your touch, sort of like a high
I used to adore your presence but now I'm like goodbye
Kept it a hundred with youWhat give you the right to lie?
We in two different spaces, and you done turned Gemini
Completely changed faces
You wouldn't understand even if we trade places
You'll never find another me, face it!
My life ain't sweet
I don't know who told you that?
My shoes, might want to tiptoe in that
Walk slow with that
I'm the same, ain't changed
But the hate where home is at
Got me like, where my homies at?
Fuck it, it's just me
Can't hold me back
You just can't bite the hand that feeds you
Especially when the hand's illegal
I got you cold
Consider it a lesson learned
I'm guessing it was just my turn
To learn the hard way
You can't always trust the ones you love
Oh yeah I think I remember you
Yeah ahhh probably not
You look so familiar too
But you just wouldn't do this to me
I know you just wouldn't do this to me
Not you, I'm sorry, I must have you confused
You got to take the good with the bad
Love what you got, remember what you had
Always forgive but never forget
Learn from mistakes, but never regret
I feel like it's coming it just ain't never done yet
You wanna take off, go head rev up the jet
Ain't gotta act like our paths should had never met
Let's be happy apart instead of together upset
I got the least out of something I put the most into
It's fucked up when assholes are who we toasting to
You remind me of somebody that I used to know
Me and that other you, weren't introduced before
And I don't like that bitch
We go from belly
I don't like that shit
Who's gonna fill your space
That's still a case
Ben Franks the only familiar face
Get money
Oh yeah I think I remember you
Yeah ahhh probably not
You look so familiar too
But you just wouldn't do this to me
I know you just wouldn't do this to me
Not you, I'm sorry I must have you confused
Cause that can't be love
You took advantage of a good thing
And that ain't a good thing
Take it how you want
I guess she forgot how I used to hold her
The nights she was goin through it
Crying on my shoulder
And did a 360 it's like she got colder
I'm starting to regret all the things that I showed her
But I'm a rider
She used to be my roller
I guess the general just lost his best soldier
I thought I felt some type of bond and got close to her
She mean to me more
Cuz ya boy a ghost to her
Oh yeah I think I remember you
Yeah mmm ahhh probably not
You look so familiar too
But you just wouldn't do this to me
I know you just wouldn't do this to me
Not you, I'm sorry I must have you confused
Ladies and gentlemen, it is quite unfortunate
That we have to gather here
for this, unjoyous occasion
I stand here before you, DJ Drama
and ask you for a moment of silence 
A lot of fallen rappers
A lot of fake emcees
Some, even your favorites

But because clearly there was no way
ANY of them, could stay alive

Rather hold my head high and die, then live and duck
I gotta'  Set It Off  -- Jada, Queen and Vivica
The last chick was scared to get that money, I can't live like her
Got no problem with you niggas, get it how you live it, bruh

All I asks is for the same respect that I be givin' ya
If not my boy will put the  Beats  on you -- Karen Civil ya
That boy be on his shoot first, never mind the trivia
My advice,  Don't Mess With His Man , word to Nivea
We go back to when we got that white from Bolivia
We was  Candy Shoppin'  before 50 and Olivia
That's when you would go uptown, cause you had to re' there
Everybody broke back then, you had to repair
Drug dealing was cool back then, you had to beware
That was the 90's, ya'll wouldn't get it, you had to be there
That's why I'm glad to be here, some of us never made it
It's hard to get off the ground, ya'll think I just levitated?
Ya'll think it was all love and nobody ever hated?
Y'all think cause I never state it I never been devastated?
All ya'll see is sunshinin', think I was never shaded
Ya' think these calendar models is all that I ever dated
Nigga,  Nothing Was The Same , HOT 97 played it
Everyday they made it that I stayed with 57 plated
Can't trust nobody, the crib is heavy gated
You ask why? I tell them even heaven's gated
You know why? Cause when you good, the Devil hate it
And even if you heavy weighted people want you feather weighted
Attention I never payed it, me and this clever lady
She brains, do some thangs, then we lay together faded
And while I chill, loaded up a steel
Just wishin' a nigga would but knowin' a nigga will will
But for real nigga good is how you feel
But soon as a nigga good is as soon as a nigga will will
Still, I don't owe these niggas nothing nothing
Put that in a nigga will will
Damned if you do them, if you don't, don't, don't don't
But they don’t have a heaven or hell to put you through, nooo
You'reed if you do,ed if you don't
People sit around and judge you anyway
Don't don't, don't, don't 
Ohh ooh ahh ooh-aah 
My young's get it fucked when ya talk about this game
like it's designed in their favor
Like it ain't outlined for them to waver their rights for a little fame
Get into bullshit fights for a little name to get
noticed by some niggaz that don't give two fucks about you
Till you make them a few bucks they doubt you
Tell them you don't do the jobs and shucks and they
route you to the shelf
See there is no money is good health
So they need you to be sick with it
Ill content and delivery niggaz
This nation thrives of misery nigga
So if you ain't trying to let you hard times increase my wealth
Nigga keep that progressive shit to yourself
This is the business of buying souls and we only fuck
with those who try to sell them
You see they may see me as an adversary cuz they know
i'm trying to tell them about the farest artist who
grow only to meet indutry acess
How they take a niggaz dreams and write them off in their taxes
Contracts is confusing
But don't worry they'll appoint the lawyer for you
Whore you
Loan you funds to fuck your soul and make you pay it all back
and still maintain control of stroll your track and your hot ass slow flow
They'll keep you looking good and all that
But no dough
You see when they get a bitch they got a bitch
Incontrary to popular opinion it ain't my sisters that
switch is my brothers we the dumb motherfuckers
Harderst niggaz in the street turn to industry suckers
cuz we refuse to do the knowledge
Nigga you can't learn this shit in the streets or in college
So you better pick up a book or something
Or fuckin Black Ice will put it in a hook or something
and hope that you listen to it
Got you pumpin that poison while they paint you them
illlusionary parades and keep pissing through it
You pussies don't know price or the sacrifice that
this industry makes real niggaz walk
F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S album number 3 Real Talk
I introduce you to the life the life  
You meet the life the life, the life meets you
Everything is nice nice

Everything's "In Living Color" plus the fly girls
On the way in gotta watch 'em with a keen eye
Niggaz ain't seen fly 'til they seen I
Maybach 'cause I'm not a limousine guy
Suit with the bow tie, no bean pies
The Lapels match well with these Ferragamies
Killer shoe game, these are just a pair of Hummie's
Mami, I get up like QB's
Nah, she ain't stepped in blood, those are Lou B's
We don't follow, unless you lead us into VIP
When they know your face, they don't need to see ID
I can see the bottles comin from a mile away
Sparklers on the top, act like they don't want to stop stop, stop
She fuck with niggaz like Fabolous
'Cause to tell the truth baby, life's fabulous
It's the fabulous life , oh I be livin that

Get your money right huh?, you could be livin that huh?

It's the fabulous life yes, oh I be livin that yes
Oh I be livin that yes, oh I be livin that
How ya livin?, oh I be livin fabulous
I bow my head and I praise that
We be there and back before the Rosey's flat
Picture me anywhere a clown stays at
I don't think so, homey don't play that
Everything is "boss", like a Rick ad, lib
 Take It To Da House  like it's Trick Dad', crib
We hit Miami like a Hurricane
Shorty poolside, one piece Vera Wang
She the baddest bitch in them Jackie O shades
Floppy beach hat, she don't give me no shade
Hold the  Heat  down, she don't even know Wade
Nigga get smoked like cigarette totes
I like a soft kiss and I dig a wet throat
I love when booty bounce like cigarette boats
And it won't quit won't quit
She can't wear skinny jeans 'cause her ass don't fit don't fit
Real shit
Got a rich bitch on the way
That for real though, just like Wanda say
She just wanna rock my world in a Wanda way
I'm sitting at the airport like andele
First I saw the luggie with the Louis monogram
Then I saw my baby like a sonogram
On the runway, just me and Bentley
I open doors, you ain't gotta "G To Gent" me
I was thinkin Knick game, courtside
She put her hand in my pants, I let that thought slide
We can get it on but there's no leg room
No water bed, just a boat with a bedroom hey!
Now you tell me what can top this? hey!
Layin on a deck topless hey!
Got two different tans, it's a fabulous thing
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain
Mida, allow me to introduce myself, I'm known as Faboloso
When it's time to slide, I'm known to grab the most hoes
When I climb inside, they known to grab me close though 
When it's time to ride, I'm known to grab the toast though
By the expression on these hotties grill uhuh
I can tell that wanna holla at somebody real what up
And I'm usually looking for somebody skilled 
Enough to make a nigga scream Ayayayo
Niggas get mad, cause I may slay they hoe
But I don't wanna let these AK strays go
Stop face fightin' me, like ya face frighten me
Besides, what I need wit another case fightin' me
Nigga what I need is a ounce of good cronic 
Unbelievable amounts of hypnotic yaeh
A shorty wit a ass that bounce like hydraulics 
And a nigga is straighter than six o-clock 
Gangsta
Hey yo ain't nuttin changed but the leaves on the trees
And y'all comin short like the sleeves on the tees
The money long here like a weave to your knees
So I don't just stunt man, I leave with the breeze
And I don't just front man, I back it up
I'm so cool you might wanna zip your jacket up
I breeze through, bullshit, I sees through
with the snub nosed three-eight, bullets just squeeze through
Chah, and he's through, just like autumn
When niggaz slip and they fall, guess who caught 'em?
Fuck it! Kill 'em all, let God sort 'em
Next year Gucci shoe, yeah I sport 'em yeah I sport 'em!
And I would tell you where I bought 'em
But they ain't from here and they might be
So fall back like the seats in the back
Niggaz late, take your seats in the back, church
You heard what my boy said
Ain't nuttin changed but the leaves on the trees
That's right he on a money run
Loso you lappin these niggaz
And ain't nuttin up but the top on the Coupe
The pockets are fat man that's guap' with a scoop
Got Three Little Women like a pop singin group
I make my point, the ball drop through the hoop
They on my joint, that's how I roll up with the paper
Under the wing niggaz just fold up like the paper
You gon' make me put you in a headline
And your girl gon' help me come up with a hair line
The suck game while I'm drivin is a fool
She know it's head first like she divin in a pool
Right stroke, left stroke was the best stroke
Bitch blow whistle like she had a ref's throat
Foul! And that's so flagrant
Aim at your neck and I spray that fragrance
I'm wear the chrome like cologne
Smell me? Nothin you can tell megone!
Ain't nuthin you can tell this nigga Loso man
What you gon' tell this nigga man?
This nigga know what he doin man
Young niggaz just fall back out here man
All y'all niggazyou, you, you
Tap him on his shoulder, you!
All y'all niggaz fall back
It's ours, Loso is here
Where the fuck's all these niggas saying Ran' isn't hot
I damage the block
I scramble like Randall with rocks
I'm that nigga in the gambling spot
Cracking jokes and drinking liquor
You still gotta hand me your watch
I'm in the kitchen with the pans and the pots
Razor on the plate, trying to figure out how many grams I'm a chop
Family or not, some niggas making plans with the cops
Trying to figure out how to make this animal stop
Who these niggas trying to take down
Break down, tray pound, eight rounds
He ain't feeling nothing from the waist down
Hit up, lit up, he never gonna get up
There's only one legend alive
The rest you gotta dig up
You acting like it's hard to roast ya 
I'll creep in your crib, and put your brains on you Barkley posters
Got no time to be boxing around
I got the ox and the pound
I'll leave you in the box in the ground
Got the keys to the game, and we locking this down
Underwater with the sharks, and we not gonna drown
Got the order from the narcs, they still watching the town
I'm copping a pound
They ain't no stopping us now, my nigga
Ya clip trip, clip spit
Get your strip wet
I got the rubber grip Smith and my rich sweats
Player haters talking 'bout they gonna get Freck
I'm in the Lamb' sunk lower than the shipwreck
They call me bar-for-bar 'cause I spit the better lines
The white bitch got me rich like Federline 
Fuck a G-pack, I'll show you how to read crack how? 
You get it soft, and then you rock it like T-Mac   
The weed good price, plus it smoke so speci how much it cost?
Three thousand full pound of some Dro pesci
Y'all niggas only talkers
I'll let my homies spark ya
We in the spurs, that's faster than Tony Parker what else?
This is family, don't ever cross my brother no
Like Big Worm, niggas rather cross their mother
Mention names in my family tree
This nigga talking crazy like insanity plea
I, swear to god, the next nigga I give it to
Is going to a place FedEx can't deliver to let's do it
I'm West Philly Freck, yeah I get dirty
I'm the best, hands down, like six-thirty
Look
Like Michael J  Fox, I got  Family Ties 
Posing us can't be wise
Swept across the family dies
Something small as a look, can bring about a man's demise
And whoever he stands beside, hit him where he can't survive
Throw the drop, or slip an object, if not then missing
Nine shot, pop a clip in, pine box the opposition
Put him in formal dress, right hand across the left
No autopsy necessary to determine the cause of death
Six shots across the chest should explain his loss of breath
Skin peeled off your flesh, I know you wish you wore a vest ha ha ha
That's a no brainer, I'm coming with both flamers
I'll spray 'em, but I'm no painter
To this here, I'm no stranger
It's obvious you no bangers
You dudes pose no danger
Your whole crew chumps, in the closet like coat hangers
Like purple broke up in the dutch
Leave you broke up on a crutch
That's what happens when shooters choke up in the clutch
We gonna body you, and have to hook your wife to an I V  too
Put both of your parents side by side in I C U everybody lose
Closed casket so they can't have a proper wake
Don't interfere with family business, that's how we operate
Niggas is letting birds turn the tables on they squad
Need help with a jump, got some cables in the car
Cause they all become nondescript
When something bright is on your wrist
Like you repping the bionic six
Who wanna fire, when guns fire, your lungs tire
I'm an idol, niggas is Sanjaya, now who wanna try us
That four-five will spit
I'll slump you in the driver seat
And make you really ghost ride the whip
It's real talk, shady niggas couldn't get a tan from me
Cause I get in the ring for that Vince McMahon money
Soon as his un-tuck BAM
Talking about you touch grams
I'm coming through your window something like  Brother Man 
It's just who we are
If I see yar, it's E R
Vacay in D R , shirt and jeans, G-star
Tell me how they gonna manage
Letting off Virgina Tech's now, dudes ain't even safe on campus
Gotta spaz on cowards
Every twenty-four, every half-hour
Niggas be trying to be Jack Bauer
So let fam' keep talking
You gonna need a  Weekend At Bernie's 
If you trying to see a  Dead Man Walking 
I guess it's left to me, the popcorn slinger, to pop off nigga
Callouses on my pop finger, pop off nigga
Pop through, throw the drop, kick the lock off dump
'Fore them bodies drop out, six glocks in the trunk
Chef boy supplying, whip whop is drying
When they move that, more whip whop arriving
And my connect from Phoenix, the connect named Phoenix
Still Keep the iron like my right hand anemic
For the family, I'll be squeezing, no reason
Blood work, nobody leaving this bitch breathing
Niggas on the low, kidnapped my flow
Coulda asked for it, I woulda gift wrapped my flow
Don't gotta ask for it, I'm gonna sit back the fo'
Flip it around, let the handle crack ya jaw
Eastside, Westside, I'll be in my Converse
This a convict rapping, It's a con's verse
Arm & Hammer mis-man, 'Los, Joey, or Ris-am
All they gotta do is chirp
And them things are gonna blis-am
Shake down, fiz-am
Straight from the Brooklyn borough that never riz-an
Block-ay block-ay
Now if they get me on wire traces
I'm gonna die in comstaat
I got prior cases from riding with firearms cocked
Fire bomb box, set up by your mom's block
Go off on time, 'cause it's wired by alarm clock
I get his legs, you grab him by his arms ock
We gonna go this liar harm while his crying moms watch
Last seen in Brooklyn, they found 'em by a Bronx lot
Rifles on the roof, yeah we got him by a long shot
We don't fire warning shots, niggas fire on swat
And if they get me, Brooklyn gonna riot on spot
I'm from the hood, so I'm supplying bomb rock
'Round here that's better than buying from Viacom stock
Look, you can't hold nothing, but I got a shell to give
I'll make his relative show me where the fella live
Ain't that his baby sis', get up in this Mayby' miss
Before I pull this perm and start swerving like Jadakiss
If he heard yet, bet that get the word buzzing
You send a message when you kill a nigga third cousin
Niece, nephew, they gonna need Tef' too
This'll a go in and out they chest like a breath do
You Clay Aiken-soft
You playing games until this red light's on ya
It's like the Playstation's off
Smith & Wesson work, Luger nine labor
Professional shit like they did me on majors
This is family nigga, do not cross the brothers
I'll put you in the box, one hand across the other
A small price to pay, son, it might cost your mother
One of your grandparents, even your baby brother
Cause everybody knows, everybody goes
I want them in coffins, everybody's closed
Related by the streets, this is family beef
So you better not touch a branch on this family tree
Nigga
Aye my nigga, do me a favor what's that my nigga?
If you happen to bump into the streets 
Can you please tell 'em I'm back? oh okay, I'll do that
Appreciate that my nigga, haha
Na-nana-nana-na, na-nana-nana-na
Na-nana-nana-na, na-nana-nana
Well alright, okay

For too long, a mistake
But right now, I feel awake
I'm feelin like I'm back just like I'm back
Said I'm feelin like I'm back feel like I'm back
I take it in I take it in, I blow it out I blow it out
On the courthouse steps after they throw it out throw it out
Bentley waitin by the curb, I spur it out I spur it out
Doors don't open they selves, the chauffeur get out well alright
My exhale made everything a foggy blur woof
I make my way through the reporters and photographers okay
I take my lady's hand yes, I shake my attorney's attorney's
Then slide in the back seat and let's begin this journey nice
Told the driver hold on 'fore we pushed out pushed out
I let my window down, out comes a kush cloud a kush cloud
Any last words? , justice has been served
Now back to the streets that's what the hustlers deserve
I ain't lose a step lose a step, I ain't miss a beat miss a beat
Thugs have emotions, we miss the streets we miss the streets
We kiss the heat muah, we love the block we love the block
We rubberband the money the money, we black glove the glock well alright
I'm screamin free at last free at last, free at last free at last
She used to send me pictures, so I could see that ass okay
That's real talk real talk, that's a real bitch real bitch
As fly as I left, the mink still fit nice

Appear in a casket courtesy of Loso
So so, you should have your shit packed

If that ain't what it is, then what is it then? okay

Nobody gonna eat, 'less we see chips

My waiters make ladies see sick
I'm "So So Def" like a J D  remix
I got enough whips to keep switchin up flavors
Drafted outta high school, straight into the majors
These haters, fake smiles, but they hardly like me
They hate to see me in a party icy
Clean white T, sippin on Bacardi lightly
Suade low cut Force, one caramel nightly
We gonna light it on fire
I got a ear for your amp it up with Jersey's answer
The chancellor standin up for ten minutes man
It's tough plan, plan that's what the camma does

But I day dream, about kissin' on the neck of you
Style is impeccable, smile is incredible
Ain't nothin' like ya, and baby I done met a few
The way I feel it's almost like crush crush
My heart beats faster it's almost like a rush rush
And that's just when you enter in a room

I feel like Mariah "We Belong Together"
It's my pleasure, I treasure, that I met ya
Bet ya I could get ya on the first time
Now I remember datin', the first time was intimidatin'
No rush though I spent the whole November waitin'
Come on, look at the patience that I'm demonstratin'
After a Week or two I usually start eliminatin'
But we got through the convo on the phone
Now we finally chillin' in the condo all alone
I tried to be expressive, with out being aggressive
Just being suggestive, a little more impressive
And I'm a good player I listen to the coach
He showed me the play book and said this is the approach
If you ever wanna score, cause some players rush they shots
And that's why they never on the floor
And that's why we both feel comfortable
Like long time friends, only been a month or two
I got moves, and I know When to make'em but
I only give'em if I know you can take'em Uh oh
Now before the first time we layed down in the bed
You ain't know the kinda thing that playd around in my head

Thats word to Brooklyn
I'm back I don't know what the fuck is wrong with these niggas
Maybe cause I'm eatin And these bastards fiend for my grub
I carry pumps like I serve gasoline to these scrubs
Have you seen my Aston leanin on dubs
And they can't afford chrome so they puttin vasoline on they hubs
I'm lookin for a girl with a ass like Trina to rub
Take home and let her watch the plasma screen in the tub
These niggas hate I'm movin so much cash and cream in the club
And dont pass my green on my bub
But I'm a fly nigga that don't do much to pull her and dick her
Everyday I'm poppin a tab and pullin a sticker
Everyday I'm switchin the tags and pullin up sicker
Every "K" I'm loadin the mags with bullets to flicker
And I aint hesitatin homie I'm pullin it quicker
So you can act tough After a few pulls on some liquor
Got em pullin on niggas
And they won't be goin nowhere for a while
They might as well pull out a snicker Ye-Ye-Yea
Forgive me father for I have sinned
But look at all this money that I spend
And look at all this jewlery that I'm in
And look at all the places that I've been
And look at all the women in those brims
Look at the blue flames that I'm in
I look at all the bullshit that theres been
And if I had another chance I'd do it again
Anywhere the kid move you know the hammers'll be with me
Pokin out the shirt like a Pamela Lee titty
I went on tour brought the samples of D wit me
Came back a month later bought a Lambo for three-fifty
Think I throw you grams if you read with me
Just because you see me on the camera with P  Diddy
Dammit we P-driddy??? Now I got G with me
Along with the third leg that I be rammin in these bitties
I keep the revolver you hope my gun'll jam
But with the soap its gonna blam
The info put freckles on your face like Opie Cunningham
Thats why I'm watched by the Feds and scoped by Uncle Sam
Dope and hunn-ed hundred grams rope and hunn-ed grams
At the same time our artist get to open Summer Jam
Hope you understand or use better sense
These niggas dont want no beef they want lawsuit settlements Nigga!
I'm in a waggy with em passin by ya
With a baby girl who suck harder than Maggie on a pacifier
What I'm smokin'll have you aggie as your last supplier
When you can smell it through the bag you know that's some fire
Gettin stressed by these hotties is regular
I got a magazine to press to your body like editors
Test me somebody I'm beggin ya
I got the gatling gun like Jesse The Body in Predator
I'm a hustler I dont sling no rocks to the fiends now
Got dudes who sit on corners like a boxer between rounds
Any other dude who dish rocks want beef
Cause I chop jobs bigger than Chris Rock front teef
I'm the nigga tearin the walls up in your miss in exchange for a small cup 
of the Cris
And while you at probation fillin a small cup full of piss
I'm in a coupe with a roof that ball up like a fist Catch up!

Bring some money out homey, we spend again
Wipe the frown off shorty, we grinnin again
Did he say again? Yesssss we winnin again
I'm ridin through the metropolitan, everybody hollerin
Me I'm just acknowledgin, with this million dollar grin
Shine like a halogen, cool as the island wind
I don't judge myself but if I do I'd give my style a ten
Met a chick, who belong, on front of Cosmopolitan
Thick in the right place, otherwise she model thin
She don't do no swallowin, but she got a wilder friend
Who don't give a fuck, I told both of them to follow then
I'm with the familiar, you might be familiar
with a few faces but they still the nine milli-a
They be like the Young Guns, so I guess I'm Billy bruh
I do more than William Bryant, I'm a little Willie-er
Change a little chillier, wrist a little sillier
And I'm grown, so I'm not, really the, kid at all
But I hope you get it y'all, I can't say I did it all
But believe that 'fore I leave it I'ma try to get it all
What I don't get at all, is what these critics call
stuntin, don't mean nuttin, they don't live her like they read it y'all
It ain't the car, it's the way it's kitted y'all
Meanin it's the little things, like the way my fitted fall
The way my posture lean, the way my necklace hang
You should respect this gang, if not expect this bang
But all this wreckless slang, it don't effect us mayne
They build you up to break you down, it's just like Tetris mayne!
That's why I sex Ms  Thang, and let the next miss hang
And even if I wake up late I do the breakfast thang
That's an important meal, I is the important deal
Jay brought me to Def Jam, feel like it's Jordan deal
I'm young mellow game-winning young fellow
Remember me, I mixed one white with one yellow
Turned nuttin into somethin, you can do it too
This the music that you do it to, 'Lo-so
Go for some food baby
It's Loso man, representin Brooklyn to the motherfuckin death

They pushin my buttons to fuck with my campaign
They know Jermaine is here to take over the game
Now I'ma hear my chain or the Crown Vic chain
The shakedown chain, I clean it in champagne
Then I take aim and I blocka, blocka
Them heavyweight shots from the choppa, choppa
You can Google Cafe, I'm a shotta, shotta
And me no play play when I wrap a, rapper
Since the bubble L-E-X-U-S

The Remy and the bourbon be burnin my chest
S F  we the best, middle finger to the rest
I said, fuck 'em all, motherfuck 'em all
Cause I shot so much I smell like the fuckin mall
It's so many guns ain't nowhere to tuck 'em all
And you might dodge one, let me see you duck 'em all
No way, no how, shit I know that
Almost as much as I know O J 'll blow trial
I be in the club, Rose, no smile
Few pretty chicks like "Okay can we go now?"
I must be the niggy
I run in your house, snatch your lil' russy and diggy
It's nothin no biggy, and if I hafto I do it myself
I'm feelin like a Puff with no Biggie
Now these joker niggaz OD'n pullin a huge head

I know these niggaz hoped I wouldn't make itfuck you
Your hatred only made me wanna cake yafuck you
Wherever I see you nigga I'ma buck you
And put a hole in your chest that's big enough to drive a truck through
I bring the drama back where you lives, flatter your wiz
Reload and then point the Mag at your kids
So what I sound remorse, the records I still peep guns on me
But the difference now is only Deserts
If I talk it's gonna be reckless  I'm ready to die
So when I apply pressure, niggaz gon' respect it
Tote guns to rob niggaz, I told 'em to use
And leave enemies of friends that like broken and bruised
They ain't crazy, they just broke and confused  cross me
And they'll be talks of how they found the man smoked on the news
I'ma career crookthey used a mug shot from my graduation picture
And my junior high school yearbook
Paul Cain never appear shook
Yeah I might talk to my enemies but never police nah
You wanna converse it better be brief  you ain't gotta say much
Show me the money and the cheddar'll speak
If it ain't involvin bread, I ain't with it
I don't need D's on me, I'm already dodgin Feds
When the shots from the revolver spread
Duck, I don't discriminate, leave CEO's and artists dead
Make slugs a part of his head
Vanish then pop up in a SL double nickel, scarlet red
Fuck you I'm tryna get my cash right
All my niggaz flip birds and blast pipes, addicted to the fast life
Live everyday like my last night  OD'in or X
When I got signed like Len Bias on draft night 
Niggaz , Street Dreams  , 
I see ya faggot ass scheminfuck you
Bitch you don't wanna swallow semenfuck you
No you hate the way I'm "Street Dreamin"fuck you
That's why I ridin, clappin, wit the  40 Cal screaminfuck you
When I pulled the 5 out  I kinda expected
For the backstabbers, to be standin behind me, wit they knives out
Then the Range, wit the fins drove in
I wasn't shocked to see my foes, dressed in friends clothin
ButI still pull through the sty  wit handguns
As big as the one, Robocop pulled from his thigh
You prolly heard about the bullets I buy  and how it look like
I'm throwin batteries, when the bullets shoot by
So what, you wear a vest, why would I care
If I aim for ya chest, that be a good idea
Nigga, it's nothing to clap ya  but I'm more worried
Bout the groupie cops, who wanna put they cuffs on a rappa
That's why I'm limpin off wit a freak  and a lawyer
Who woulda got O J  Simpson off in a week
I could show you how to blow up on ya own  in a Benz
That'll hit a buck! and make the windows go up on they own
Wit a stash box compartment for  a handgun
That make holes the size of peep holes, on apartment doors
My closet look like department stores  and you wonder why
Ya girl's comin home, wit a cigar sip for
Cause I just dump the light Dutch, mash the guts
You won't believe how much ass I touch
Who else struts pass the sluts, and a chain wit so much
Ash and cuts, that it hangs much pass the nuts
That's why I get followed by broads  wit deeper throats
Then the people at the circus, that be swallowin swords
Y'all hopin that the Don fall off  but my money's long enough
To keep shootin ya bank until, ya arms fall off
I'm eatin, and I ain't have to use someone's utinsels
And when you clean as me, you know that every bum is against you
But please don't let someone convince you  to test the kid
And get hit wit slugs as long, as a No  2 Pencil, fucka
It's g-a-n-g-s-t-a
That's how it be and it's gon' say Y'all know whoooooooo
That's how it be when you see me
That's how it be in NYC Y'all know whoooooooo
If it's me it's got to be
G-a-n-g-s-t-a Y'all know whoooooooo
I'm still living la vida loca
Where hoes sell prices on weed or coke-a
For the hustlers, for the customers, trust the buzz
It's have you makin' one of the sounds that Busta does woo HAH!
They love me just because
I'm in the gallardo, laughing like Ricky Ricardo Ha ha ha ha
With the 4-pounder, pretty gangsta nigga
I'm the co-founder, I know the difference between pimps and hoe-hounders
I can tell when they ain't learn to lean
They gold cups missing stones, turning green
I roll up wrist in chrome, burning green like what's good
God was in a good mood, on the day he made me
I'm from the projects, it's the way it made me
And I wouldn't change it for nothing
I stay on point, that's 'cuz I know the danger of stuntin'
But the aim is like I'll be at the ranges or somethin'
It takes a gangsta, to know a gangsta
That's why we look at you like a stranger or somethin'
'Cuz we can tell by the body language you frontin'
And it take a little more than lettin' ya pants sag
Ya sand bag, tryna jump on the band wag
I'll put the red dot on you like a Japan flag
You need some high heels and a handbag
I'm in the ten minutes to nine, leanin' on 'em
Like I'm ten minutes behind, fuck a hundred shots
Give me a  40 cal wit' ten in it, I'm fine
Just spray, and shit'll get you ten minute of shine
Keep a friend in it, that's ten cented for mine
Keep the rims in it, that spin in it for mine
Can't see him in it, I been tinted up mine
But you know a nigga look oh so gangsta
Oh no thank ya, I earned my key
My name'll get you fucked up, and burners tee
That's gangsta love, from the heart
Yo I told y'all from the start
And now y'all know whoooooooo
Keep it G'd up, I can't slow down, these creep's speed up
Cali bringin' peeps and weed up
I'm coming through with a bunch of girls that'll deep a seed up
It's a gangsta party
Who want to bet us that they can't fuck with us?
Stack cheddar forever, live treacherous, all the etceteras
Until the death of us, me and my confidantes, we shine
We make the ambiance, you niggas just rhyme
You little niggas need guidance, you barkin' up the wrong trees
Pissin' on the wrong hydrants  I'm a high fence
I grew up around violence, you grew up playin' violins
In your hoodsilence  where I'm fromsirens
They just killed this vibe, they just killed this vibe
There's something about killin' shit that makes us feel alive
We feed off your energy, we see you on that Kenny G
Just tooting your own horn, do your thing my N-I-G
Whenever you "ven aqui" to that mighty NYC
We gon' check that name you claim, bring your YAWK! and I D
We take it the wrong way, all gold, everything
One gold watch, two gold chains, give me all thoseeverything
Y'all don't want to bump heads -- Ocho, Evelyn
Them boys will leave you butt naked, the mall closed and everything
The Streets Is Watching, asking if you gon' reply to them
Seems like I woke up sleeping giantsEli and them
A major comeback but from my minor setback
They still don't know we living just thinking about the get back
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back
I crack a smile knowing God has a day for me
Until that day comes I slay these niggas faithfully
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back
I'm like Nino with the uzi back of the motorcycle heading
to get back at them Italians who killed Keisha at the wedding
I'm like Doughboy lookin' for Ricky's killerone last soldier
Niggas who turn they backs on me turn your punk ass over
Y'all smoked my cousin Harold, now I'm in the Camaro
Loving and Happiness playin', me and my dog with this double barrel
38, 40 belows, live or die motherfucker
I'm Pac, you Radames "Riverside Motherfucker!"
The get back everybody better get back, tell my niggas in the jet black
Until the seats let back on your jet back, if you're a gamblin' man you could bet that
It's a "sure thing not just a New York thing or a rich or a poor" thing
It's a "lace your boots pull your drawstring who want to go to war" thing
It's a "who gon' protect your thing who really want it more" thing
"Puttin' legends in coffins and some bullet holes in the door" thing
It's a "nobody saw things, street cold not a law" thing
It's "kids that wasn't taught things, old ladies like poor" thing
Poor thing and the get back is impor-tant
Poor thing for the dead homies, we pour 'pagne
Like what you say while it's cocked back to him
Guess what goes around comes around got back to him
"Now these motherfuckers smoked your goddamn cousin in FRONT of you, nigga!
Blew his head off in front of your face and you ain't gon' do SHIT?!
You acting like a little bitch right now nigga! Man FUCK that, I ain't lettin' that shit ride!
We gon' go in there and smoke all these motherfuckers, I don't care who the fuck out there!
Goddamnit! Is you down nigga?!"
Ay yo, it's get down or lay down
My shit sound like trey pound
Stand up if they G's, sit down if they clowns
Get a bitch? I got a bitch
She get round, she stay round
Girl just wanna have fun, your bitch found a playground
I swing by, slide through, see-saw the before
Niggaz won't believe this, record the freak raw
On the road to riches, these broads get detoured
They just firecrackers, we more like C4's
Think we talking blowing up, pop a cork and pour it up
Life in the fast lane -- you think talk'll slow us up?
Nuh-uh, never that, not in this lifetime
Thought the game was dead, it just got new lifeline
I revived that real shit, y'all deprived from real shit
Small hood to all good, we strive like Will Smith
Fresh Prince of Bel-Air  flow sick, need health care
They ain't got nothing for the kid, I'm gonna need welfare
Hell yeah, she down, down like she upset
I took her down two months ago, bitch ain't came up yet
Money over bitches, dirt on top of bitch niggaz
Put you in your place -- it happened to be a ditch, nigga
Get down now
If you gon do it, baby, then do it now
Cause later on I might not be on the shit that I'm on
Your chance'll be gone
So get down now
Get down now
Stack the heavy bread away, sleep on the small bills
Evil growing every day, keep on your toe heels
Brung her Ecstasy, now she geeked off of four pills
Snuck her from the blind side, screeched off on four wheels
I'm so ill, too slick
With boys I get horse
She ain't really trying to pop the clique off, the chick tossed
I think I fucked the world, six toys and lip gloss
She yelling for the Lord, I threw on my big cross
I get mine, get yours -- I'm score-bound on fourth down
Don't make us bring them bulldogs round, Georgetown
Vixens in great jeans, unzipped those since eighteen
You won't use me, use that strip pole to make clean
I get high, space lean, enough clothes for ten troops
Same time, I spend loot on BM's and Benz coupes
Porsches and Lambos and 'raris for candles
Front if you want, my four-five in my camo
Blam-o! Don't touch 'less you wanna get burned up
Your good girl's a renegade, I got her all the way turnt up
Bag dimes like ten a day, episodes in my first truck
We ain't gotta go home, we can go right there in the cut and
Yo, yall gon' hear this in the nightclubs for a year
When the song go on, throw on, ya tight mugs or ya stares
It's like Bugs up in here
Like Thugs up in here
Throw ya fingas up like you gon' snipe slugs in the air
Hatersmight have a slight grudge when I'm there
See the strobes on my wrist, light bubbles in my ear
Ladies pass through, I might rub on her rear
Pop Cris' in her face, make her wipe suds from her hair
Even dykes tug on my gear the way I like strut up in here
Don't get the Nike's smudged that I wear
Drinks be flingin, minks be swingin
The way the pinky-ringin, link be blingin, you think we slingin?
I wanna see the roof of your coupe, sittin behind ya
18 inches and up, no sittin on minors
After tha club hittin a diner, spittin the lines
And end up in a hotel, gettin vagina
Ladies- Rub ya tits if ya gettin right Hey
Niggas- Grab ya dicks if ya gettin right Ho
Don't be thinkin bout that nigga that you wit tonite
Don't be thinkin bout that chick that you wit tonite
Ladies- Rub ya tits if ya gettin right Hey
Niggas- Grab ya dicks if ya gettin right Ho
If gettin right is the only thing you wit tonite
Ladies Hey
Niggas Ho
Ma, it's hard to stop and not admit it
You like the way the drop I got is kitted
Cops can't spot who is it
You wanna stop and jot ya digits
Must be how I hop on yatchs and visit, tropic spots I did it
The top the watch is glitted
Make niggas wanna bop they knots, stop and plot to get it
Like I won't pop a shot in fitteds
I got the type of machine guns that cops and swats prohibit
I wanna drop but not to hit it, stop we not committed
Think we hittin shoppin spots, forget it
Move ya neck, rock from side to side
Neva get checked, me and my glock side and side
This in ya deck let it knock inside ya ride
We in the 'jects of the blocks in the widest five
Spendin a grands nutin for 'lous lis
You aint got on a badge playa, so why you handcuffin the chicks?
Yall hardly see I be 'round
But when I do, I be, I be down in a VIP lounge
I get in the club, I dont need ID now
Bulky knit, can't even see my 3-pound
Yall know how that kid from B-Stuy be down
Yall see my C-pound, yall see yall be drowned
Skee-o, gotta, re-ply she down, which sheet I meet down
I know she gettin right- HEY
Ladies tug me when I strut
So this thug be in the cut, takin bubbly to the gut
Rays beamin, yall think I be day-dreamin
But I stay schemin like, "Shortie could get it"
Next screenin, they see all this ice and grey gleamin
They like "Damn, Shortie could get it"
And I may be crazy
But I see some ladies tonite that should be drinkin my baby's baby
Artit: Fabolous
I like'em brown, yellow, Peurto Rican or Asian
Who have the weekend occaison
Sneak in the Days Inn
I'm never tweakin' of haze an frequently blazin'
Now if they ain't on ya face it ain't the cheeks that I stay in
Cant deny it, Used to take weeks and persuasion
Now I just be lookin' down at these freaks in amazement
With a girl, The first thing I peep a notice
Is how full her lips is and deep her throat is
So you ain't gotta be perfect
I'll buy you whatever you want, But your heads gotta be worth it
Still what I mean is
Your brains gotta send chills through my penis
'Til I feel like a geinus
Look at it from a playa's postition
I got a scholarship, I get smart without payin' tuition
My classes be like two three hours
That's why I'm the smartest young guy since Doogie Howser
Still what I mean is
I really just wanna get smart until I feel like a genius
And all that I ask is
That you help me get good grades in all of my classes
Still what I mean is
I really just wanna get smart until I feel like a genius
And all that I ask is
That you help me get good grades, Ma in all of my classes
These bitches they done got real bad
Cause now I pull out, leavin 'em lookin like model for a "Got milk?" ad
I'm a teachers pet
And even if you good at math ma
you'll have trouble countin' each bauggette
All it takes wit hood tutors is some good buddha
And promise to buy them some of them Razor foot scooters
They don't care where the cops is
Outta the blue they stop biz
Teacher started givin' me a pop quiz
I stay 10 minutes in night clubs
Pocket full of green, Duke on it invented the night bulb
I might pass on a female, And call up a subsitute just for night
class in the CL
Ya man don't know why his chicks knees be scared
Can't tell her from givin' my dick CPR
If ya lift up and say ya jaws hurtin', before squrtin
It's for certain
You are the weakest link, Goodbye
You know my girls in North and South Caddy
They all for mouth waxin'
And the whores in Texas, Oral sexes
I head to Cali, Take more blows to the head than Ali
And the Philly momies suck the kid outta Willie Bonnie
And the way females show Southern Hospitality in ATL
Dont even know them hoes
In South Beach, They let me jimmy dip in they mouthpiece
Forget about Vegas, The head is outrageous
The broads in Seattle will make ya knees rattle
Fa shizzle da snizzle get smizzle down in VA
Them hoes in Detroit will suck the Breevort
My dick don't get to die down when I'm in Chi-Town
My bitches in B-More, blow me 'til they knees sore
Good, there face I, ain't screwed down in St  Lou'
New York, It ain't got no pipe instructions
They just suck outta you like liposuction
From hood to hood they see what's hood
And know who I be! uh!
I got the Yankee leaning, just sittin over to browse
And the G4 is just getting over the clouds
You can't tell me that I ain't what's up right now
I got a bottle of Tequila upside down
There's some chicks wit boyfriends that are up tight now
Cause they know the big 'dog' had a 'pups' like wow
I'm stuck in my city ways
Heading over seas wit a zip of New York City's haze
You rats can keep running through your city's maze
Until you get sprayed with the pesticide
I know you in that hole, you best to hide
Like the rest who tried, who went and testified
Of course your girl wanna slide over and be rubbed
And don't mind taking rides over the G dubs
I ride Rovers on Spre-dubs
Please don't be another dude who died over a ski dub, chill
From hood to hood they see what's hood and know who I be
From block to block they see it, not can't know who I be
From state to state they cannot hate, they know who I be
From the east to west, through the midwest and downsouth it's Ghetto!
It's Ghetto-oh! It's Ghetto! It's Ghetto-oh! It's Ghetto!
It's Ghetto-oh! It's Ghetto! It's Ghetto-ohh! It's Ghetto!
I get it jumping like a lo lo '64
And bet they hop on it like a pogo stick pro
I'm chilling wit these go go chicks though
That do the kind of things that belong in a porno flick yo
You know it's him and the gang
Wit the bling worked on, that remind you of lemon meringue
But remember the thangs, ain't too far
And y'all wanna hear em go bang bang bang
Like John Witherspoon, I'm watching em closely
I know the snakes gon' slither soon
The two toned Maybach's getting delivered soon
The back feels like sitting in the living room
I'm so hard bodied like the suit on Batman
It's that man that back to back plat' scan
I'm back for the third time, I make words rhyme for a living
You probably heard I'm still ghetto, nigga!
They tried to put two 9's on me, just like Gretzky
But my lawyer saw through it just like wet tees
I smoke till my eyes look just like Jet Li's
On islands where the water's blue just like Pepsi
Yeah the trigger just might get squeezed
And the slugs will skip over your waves, just like jet skis
Hoes know Ghetto from New York, call em the Fresh Prince
And throw rose petals when I walk
They love how I came back hard like good blow
And I'm still a heart throb to a hood ho
That's what hood though, yes I would know
That's cause I'm in the streets like man hole covers
Rims look like blades when a fan blow brother
I'm waiting on a storm to land, roast others
The man no other, cause I been in it
My time is money, y'all couldn't buy ten minutes
I'm gone! catch up!
Those that are bourgeois
Those that are hoochie
Those are usually in Gucci
Some of them no good
But they all pros at you know what
Local or overseas
They all go crazy over me
Don't matter what part of the world
Girls want to be part of my world
Look, I done had my share
Bringin' round me, is a bad idea
I take Big or small, short or tall
Light or dark, I try them all
Cuz I like
From stupido groupie hoes
To one of these r&b group skio's
I need a slick mouth, thick south, brickhouse
Or I may date, a-rate playmate
Ten in the face, thin in the waist
Tight in the thighs, light in the eyes
Even those
Who think they the shit
I keep my
Walkin' on pedicured paws
Touchin' wit' manicured claws
If you waxed down, and tanned up
Then let me see ya hands up
Now
I like my
In four inch Christian Laboutins
Lips made for kissin' and poutin' I like my
Fat butt, flat gut, and that strut  to drive cat nuts
I like my Gangsta pretty, stank saditty
No change, only got frank and fitty's
Them Natural born fraks, wit blonde streaks
Seven's on cheeks
My nothin'less than a dime piece
Pink face cartier time piece
I like my
Thug enough to cuss out cops
Wit' tits that'll bust out tops
I like my Classy and sassy
Still know how to be nasty
Like my
Wit' no laws, no flaws
No bra's and no drwaws'
Those yours
From the Asian to the Malaysian
I even had the Bahian to the Caucasian
I spend most the weekend
Wit' pretty Puerto and Costa Rican
Then again, I love Dominicians
And might be stylin' wit' a Italian
I be shakin for a Jamaican and Haitian
And take by the million if they they Brazilian
I'm sailin wit' a Australian
Or trafficin' wit' the south African
Panamian or Grenadian
You know I cross the border for a Canadian
I need a miss that's Swiss, a freak that's Greek
Or distinguished English
I fly in for a Hawaiian
And if you don't know who I am
Yeah, this Trackmasters, Desrt Storm, Street familyFabolous
And this is Tone the ref, let's go
Blunts full of smoke, clips in the ashtray
Reminiscin' on our past days
Back before a nigga went cold
Back before a nigga sold his soul
The grass is way greener on the other side
The cash is way greener over here where I reside
Soon as the summer come around I'm gon' make sure you see me
Said I'ma make sure you see me, ayy but for now
Shouldn't you begone
Gone for the winter
Gone for the winter 
A-a-ain't that what the birds do?
The summer's ours and the winter too
They told me love don't cost a thing, bitch I'm headin' to the bank
T-t-that's just what it feels like
Hit the scene sippin' lean, give a fuck 'bout what you think
The summer's ours and the winter too
They told me love don't cost a thing, bitch I'm headin' to the bank
T-t-that's just what it feels like
Hit the scene sippin' lean, give a fuck 'bout what you
Uhh, straight up shit is real and any day could be your last in the jungle 
My ears to the streets, I hear your ass when you mumble 
They say you can't do it cause the last nigga fumble
As soon as you make it out, you get asked to be humble, huh
Head high, middle finger higher
My youngin' don't rap but that little nigga fire
Like Ray Allen in Game 6, when James missed
Then Bosh tapped it to him, you know what had happened to 'em
Swish! It's all about a swish
Know a nigga who would, you ain't even gotta wish
It's more in the sea and I done had a lot of fish
How she act when you ain't up will tell a lot about a bitch mm
Cause eagles don't fly with pigeons, they way higher
All wings flap but you gotta stay flyer woo!
Niggas broke as a joke, sittin' laughin' together
I started cheesin' after I turned my craft into cheddar 
I ran from the worst, chasin' after the better
Life is a bitch, I knew right after I met her
So what you have-nots know about havin' knots?
Love for a hater only thing I haven't got, yeah
Yeah, uhh, look
You know I get around baby, that's just how the life be
I like a couple towns but you know my city wifey
And I ain't spent a month at home, still be in my comfort zone
Fuck askin' for a seat, you gotta come for thrones
Kings don't speak English, we speak Kinglish
I scoop a chick from Queensbridge, she comin' back a Queen bitch
Think B I G and Kim, not think bigger than them
Everybody wanna shine, gotta give these niggas a gym
Never stressed of lil' things, like a hater
That's something that comes when you eatin', like a waiter
Live from the 718
It's the kid that always get the shoes early, I never run late
You see I big up the flows, everyword is capital
I killed all them hoes, I'm the murder capital
I'm the name they bring up that they think their bird is flappin' to
You the name that usually comes behind "Word what happened to?"
Hah, y'all old washed niggas
Was the man now your all no washed, nigga
That's why I'm on  one  like old Goerge Wash, nigga
If it's one they gotta chase it like John Walsh, nigga
I'm gone
If you wanna hear that you the gangsta somebody say "Ooh Lord!" Ooh Lord!
Them say ooh God bless no man never curse
Them say love yourself or you can't love nobody at all
If you ain't a hater, put your hands in the air right now
Bon bon mine
Blunts full of smoke, clips in the ashtray
Reminiscin' on our past days
Before a nigga went cold
Back before a nigga sold his soul
The grass is way greener on the other side
Ay, the cash is way cleaner over here where I reside
Ay, soon as the summer come around I'ma make sure you see me
I'ma make sure you see me
Shouldn't you be g-g-g-gone
Represent, represent
Came through in '9-8 and I've been reppin' since
These cats ain't real, just found out they leopard print
Cause they always talk shit then ask you for peppermints
Well, I can smell the hate on your breath
And I'm all out of Tic Tacs, all I got is click clack
Put it to your mouth just like Cutty did to Anthony
I tried to be a friend motherfucker, you under handed me
Lucky this is personal and God got a plan for me
Cause I handle my bid'ness, never let my bid'ness handle me
Sayin' your name could do more for you than it can for me
You give niggas and they forget your philanthropy
You don't have a penny 'til your name Anfernee
Don't ever bite the hand that feed you and then stick out your hand for me
We don't base, we throw niggas in the truck for real
Chase you out the hood, make you live with Uncle Phil
Champagne every night, I done drunk a mil'
Yeah, now that's money wasted
But now it's kinda hard for me to buy Ace
'Specially when I just seen Hov buy Ace
Moves, time to make moves
No more jab steps, those is fake moves
Gotta make it happen, no time for what may work
My plan B's another way to make my plan A work
I do the job myself and I'm still boss
You was in a win-win and you still lost
From Young OG to Young O'Genius

I tossed pies, flung those pizzas
My lady a work of art, call her Young Mo' Lisa
It's one o' clock in the morning, still up and I'm yawning
It's obvious that I'm tired, not as much as I'm horny
There's a sign on my dick and it says "Help Wanted"
Told shorty if she want the job fall through and get on it
Fall through and get on it
Know you got that work
I'ma fall through and get on it
Fall through and get on it

Going through my iPhone, full of girls that I bone
Bunch of niggaz I fuck with, couple of niggaz that I don't
Never mind them lames though, that ain't what a nigga came for
It's about this call of duty, and this shit ain't no game ho
I should call one named Jo, that's short for Joanna
That too legit to quit shit, this bitch just go hammer
Should dial up Dominique, her name should be Dime-I-Freak
Was supposed to be training me, instead we fuck a few times a week
In this corner – Jasmine, on the score card, I give the ass ten
Last time, we went two rounds in the front seat of my Aston
And Brittany like her hair pulled, she crazy, she dareful
That "Nah, we can't do this", turned to "OK but be careful"
Hit me on my BBM, that D turn into an R if
She ain't trying to come fall through, I leave her on that
Mia like to be comfortable, t-shirt, no drawers and
She call me Ike Turner because I beat her in the car
Beat her in the studio, even hit her friend too
So what, I got out of? Know what we got into
Tiff got them D's on her – daredevil
Down to take her top off wherever
However, Jessica get so wet
Few bottles of Moet, she ain't told me no yet
My Dominicans be the baddest ones
Que tú hace mami? Now come give daddy some
Yo, Fabolous strive for digits, even connive to get it
Niggas can't tell me nothin' dun, the 5 is kitted
for Dead Presidents any cat alive can get it
I walk around covered in ice like I survived a blizzard
got enough chips to bribe you wit' it
pay off security at clubs, get my guns and knives admitted
I'm the type that gets tried and aquitted
if my vibes ain't wit' it I pull the Four-Five and spit it
then niggas run to the precinct and describe who did it
come home and find the necks on their wives are slitted
I got niggas on my side comitted
to leave you and the driver splitted
with your brain spilled inside your fitted
Fabolous, the only way to I D  him is in a Five BM
puffin' sticky green 'till my eyes be slim
operate with more chips than IBM
fuck with me and make the news at Five PM 
If ya'll see me gettin' locked it gotta be drugs
if ya'll see chrome on the truck it gotta be dubs
if I'm givin' somethin' to haters it gotta be slugs
if it's one thing it's gotta be it's gotta be thug
no info, I'm I'm leakin' it gotta be blood
If my earlobes are hangin', it gotta be studs
if the bitch on her knees, it gotta be love
if it's one thing it's gotta be, it's gotta be thug  
Niggas don't wanna play around, they see how calm I do things
swarm in a blue range, armed with two flames
Flex play my joints, drop bombs like Hussien
catch a cataracts, glance at the charm and new chain
I got coke in every part of Brooknam that you name
niggas want it, when you wave firearms their views change
end up havin' to move they Moms to Ukraine
get ADT alarms and new names
come in the club, under each arm is two dames
buyin' bottles of Dom with my loose change
niggas hate me now 'cause I catch the eyes of dimes
flooded the hood with Tre's the size of dimes
ride through the hood with chrome pokin' off the wheels
I'm in the game tryin' to get broken off with Mils
shove the gun in your mouth, have you chokin' off the steel
niggas love the band, but the chicks open off the grill 
I'm ready to address the haters and underestimaters
hop in the truck, ride up on ya'll like escalators
hit ya chest up, leave you hooked to respirators
bed ridden talkin' to investigators
now these ladies will do anything just to date us
'cause we skate around on ice like escapaders
dressed in Gators, in peace I'm restin' haters
when police come for me, fly West to Vegas
ridin' or dyin', niggas know I'm ridin' with iron
smoke compartment in the dash that I'm hidin' the lye in

Have my Kingston bullets through ya face like I'm Bernard
Ya like beef but hate when i'm involved
Cause I don't give ya a chance ta dodge bullets from the 8 when it revolve
Niggas love when you broke but they hate when you get large
Wait for you to slip and try to find a way to get you robbed
Run in ya crib and duck tape you and ya broad
And don't leave prints so jakes never get the case resolved
So I play against the odds
When its all set two niggas with two 40s a peice retaliatin' on ya squad
If you get locked my Haitian'll leave you scarred
Rape you in the yard
With Gem Star blades cut ya face like a collage
While I sip champagne in the Vegas lamatage'
In the suite with two freaks videotapin' a manage'
Ice in the chain a face in the shepard'
Million dollar crib with a cranberry quarter and a 8 in the garage nigga
Ya'll niggas
Ya'll niggas only seen half
This is just the begining man
See ya'll niggas was hatin' now man
Ya'll niggas gonna be sick to your stomach bending over throwin' up
When ya'll see the shit we got comin'
My album ain't even drop yet man
And ya'll niggas talkin' crazy
Man Paul Cain nigga
The album comin' fourth quarter
Ya'll motherfuckers is under pressure nigga
Desert Storm, SLK we killin' everything movin' nigga
And you know the flow is on steroids this year right?
It's only right!It's Loso just in case you ain't know so
Oh they know! I'm feelin like Arnold in the 70's in here y'know?
Real icy, Call me Arnold Froze-a-nigga or some'n
Yeah I mean your wife like c'mon, life goes on
Steppin in the spot with that rich young on
Somethin crazy on my arm, yeah, yeah Barack O'Drama!
We're so out of here baby, yo, let's go
They say New York's got a problem, I'm their solution
I'm the breath of freshness through this air pollution
Dog you the smog that clogged up the city
I jog through ya fog, dawg I'm the Diddy
of this rap marathon, I'm lyrically in great shape
My late tapes are like how to lose weight tapes
The worst enertainers use me like a personal trainer
They try to use my verses as gainer
But these lightweight rappers, don't know what they up against
I put they pockets on a weight loss supplement
You're powder sniffin if you can't see our difference
It's like dumbbell curls compared to powerliftin
The way I pull up in whips
It looks betta than the pullups and dips
I'm bein done by the bartender
I mean maybe it's my star spendin
But better get her to that car window
And shorty said her name was Carlinda
That's cool, now won't you get up in this car Linda
Later I could bend you like a car fender
Have that ass wakin up tomorrow tender
The perfect push-up, it make ya pecs swell
I light the purple kush up, and then I exhale
You gotta breathe, one and then the two
I do a couple laps and be runnin it in 2
I'm nutritious, I ain't in GNC
Try the new dishes on the truck from GMC
He emcee, he ain't got to do no dancin
These diamonds are so performance enhancin
I'm princess cut up, canaried them stones
And I'm well known for how I bury 'em home
I just do my thing, and then I carry 'em home
I mean the world don't need another Marion Jones you heard?
Cryin, lyin that she never did it
Some women are Clemons, they just keep goin with it
Don't sweat it, be like Pettite, just admit it
And for the record they be sayin Barry Bonds hit it
Get it? We outta here baby
Loso is so outta here baby
Street Fam is so outta here baby
And here's another hit Barry Bonds
Uhh, uh-huh ohh
You are now tuned in to WFAB radio
Yo  Baby Girl where you at?
Right here, Right here, Right here baby, uh, here's another one
You need to holla at somebody real, such as myself
Won't nobody do as much as myself
And it's so real, I hop out and get the Duchess myself
For a pretty girl such as yourself
Cuz I'm a busy man and don't see too much for myself
and sometimes it be hard to get in touch with myself
But I, make the time when I have to
Learn to take my time and be careful when dealin'
With women there's some who be wheelin' and schemin'
And dive in to relationships cuz I got a million to swim in
They'll throw it to you faster than Schilling and Clemens
But feelings ain't the only thing that you can catch now
Some do lawyers that you hopin' ?they fed styles?
Others pass diseases that you could catch now
But in my minutes alone I think about this crazy world
And don't wanna live in it alone cuz
I'll give you all my love and you can always trust
my loyalty, honesty and security
I'll never leave can't none of these other chicks
fuck with me so holla at somebody real
Cause I'm so real
I'm searchin' for real love like J  Blige in '92
But I pray I would find you
They say weather the storm and leave the gray skies behind you
The fake may try to blind you
That's why I stay fly like I do
And no I can't trust everybody that I say "Hi" and "Bye" to
First I need a girl that may die as my boo
Then I may try the "I Do's", but I refuse
to be tricked or used by a chick
who get amusement and kicks out abusing my dick
When it's real I'm all in it
But I don't want the scars of love that you get when you fall in it
Before it didn't matter who
Now I look for some with a little attitude
I could chill to chatter to, good looking but witty and compatible
Long hair with a fatty too, and that'll do
No I'm not trying to pressure you
But my loves too incredible, far too great, right in front of your face
And I'll give you something you can feel
To let you know that I really need somebody real
I need to holla at somebody real, could that be you
The feelings that I feel, could that be true
Most cats lay where the hood rats beat boo
But I'm the kinda cat that strays away
That's till somebody real sways my way
Then I might spend some days away, on an Asia Bay
Eatin' food made the Cajun way, and sippin' a little sake
Boilin' a little broccoli
But this world is full of floozies that bullshit usually
I pull them choosy
Cuz on this joint, and at this point
I know I have to holla at somebody real, for real
YupHA-HAAAEEH!
Don't make me put one of y'all in the grave uh-uh
I'm playin' with money, y'all niggas save yup
The pain I'mma cause is something y'all couldn't face mm
A couple niggas shot cause one of y'all niggas brave
Rushin' him to the ER, rushin' me to the stage
This The Soul Tape 3, nothing we need to say
Leave the handguns at home, fuck 'em, just bring the K's
For the homies in the county with nothing that's eatin' trays homie
Since I started eatin' my motto is eat away
Top 5 is always followed by DOA 
Thought I was on top when I bottled a key of yay
Then I went straight from the block to the VMA's
The way the hands move on the clock you'd be amazed yup
You just feel the burn, nigga  you don't see the blaze 
Take a good look at my eyes, you see the haze
Right left, live or death either way
Same tough guys will cry when they see you laid
Never show your hand, they dyin' to see your spades
I'm married to the game, you dyin' to get engaged
You only gangster when the lions is in the cage coward
Your life's worth nothing, the goons had it appraised 
I might do the ray for maroon with the beige
Bad bitch with me, Louie with the shades 
If you ain't self employed than truly you a slave
Tooly to your waves, brain on your winter coat
Niggas burnin' bridges then expectin' you to send a boat
If I'm comin' at your neck think a bullet in the throat
Never gone forget you niggas, got 'em written in my notes
I'mma send the goons , a snitch gone send the folks
They gone kill you just cause, don't make me send the locs
New blue hundreds  spendin' c-notes
Fresh pair of Timbs, vintage pea-coats
I'm a stand up nigga, never been a joke
Ridin' since pedal bikes with reflectors and the spokes
I snuck up from behind, put the game in a yolk
You apply a little pressure and them rookies finna choke
Niggas lookin' washed up, it's something in the soap 
You lookin' like Adrien Broner in the ropes 
My shoes is 2 racks, I should be in the slopes
Might come through in bubble same way they send the pope 
Paradin' down 5th Ave like I'm in a float 
That new H50 push button like remote woo!
Control is hard to have, especially when you broke
They sleepin' because they eatin', but you hungry and you woke
Shorty mouth wet, but her strength is in the stroke
Greatest of all time so her name has been the goat
She say you got the people waitin' for it then it's dope
The game is fucked up, but if you back then it's hope, nigga
Shout to Desert Storm
"Gangsta Grillz, you BASTARDS!"
Whattup? Shoutout Ski
I'm supposed to style, I'm a hustler's poster child
Girls see me they 'posed to smile,
Can't you tell I get my hustle on?
Can't you tell I get my hustle on?
H-U-S-T-L-E-R
Everywhere we go, bet they know who we are,
Can't you tell I get my hustle on?
Can't you tell I get my hustle on?
DJ DRAMA!!
Now you could ask any hustler you know
They'll tell you it's in the wrist
I'm a good cook, make a hell of a dinner dish
Get stiffed quick, they say a fella is generous
I could sell stiff dick to Ellen Degeneres
I got a sales pitch, I should do a infomercial
I did Foreman Grill numbers on the strength of purple
Your money long, they go to any length to slurp you
So fuck a bitch 'less she in the Oprah Winfrey circle
Don't get me wrong, I'll get at you honey
But I'm a bachelor, all I do is spatula money
Scoop it up and flip it, hoop it up and zip it
Stand over stoves, soup it up and whip it
I'm a chef that cook up ways to make me rich
Clothin line recipe, yeah I make it rich
Them wire taps make a hustler nervous
Got a problem? Don't call me I ain't customer service
I move heavy weight, I could easily pull a muscle man
Like Tracy Morgan on Martin, call me hustle man
What you need chief, coca or the weed leaf?
Fuckin with my hustle's only gon' breed beef
Went South and came back with shoppin bags full of guns
Fresh out the box, poppin tags on the guns
A Carolina drive, up and down the 95
Got the 40's for 7, but I sell 'em 9 from 5
Fuck a 9 to 5, I'm a hustleholic
I need rubberbands, these stacks'll bust a wallet
The pills pull some money on a good E day
Every thing could buy and sell, hood eBay
You give me two dice, I ride it like the 4 train
Bring more 7-11's than the store chain
You give me three of them, I shoot 'em like a milly clip
Roll more 6's out then a Benz dealership
Yup! You could tell I get my hustle on
The scent of crack in my clothes you smell I get my hustle on
It's official y'all I was on my gristle y'all
And I whipped the raw in a Vlasic pickle jar
Before I had a deal, I was baggin krillz
And I had pills but they wasn't Advils
These rap cats wanna be Nino Brown
But I'm the hustler, I do it like Nino now
I ain't with the phone shit, in '88 I was only 6
I missed that paper, but nine-six or later what?
I did it major, plenty niggaz could vouch for me
Like them niggaz that be runnin the coke house for me
But it ain't 'bout what I was it's 'bout what I'm 'bout to be
So I wanna shout out Fab for lookin out for me 'Loso!!
I beat my case even though some niggaz was doubtin me
I took them folks to trial, the poster child
I mean, I don't even know where to start like
It's like you find love, you lose love and then
Met her up town on Dykeman, aight then, light skinned
Starin with a slight grin, I don't know, might been
'Cause I'm in this white Benz
Or the way the ice in the Breitling, flash brighter than the lightning
But I knew from right then
She was 'bout her money and how she fit right in
Knowin how I might spend
To make a story short, other than the tight end
Had a Washington Heights friend, who bring that white in
Set up a meeting, her dude caught a flight in
Sat down at Sole, popped a bottle of white then
Got straight to business like two corporate white men
The food came, before I could take a bite in
He said "you the type I usually don't invite in
But since we got a like friend, I could get you like ten" ten?
I told him I could move like ten by night's end
Put the white over the plate like I'm throwin strikes in
El Duque, got a dude in the UK, buy five bricks at a time, 22K
He send the Euros, I send the pure dough
Now that's the real meaning of a foreign exchange
He smiled, then finished his glass of wine
There's a van outside, pull your S-Class behind
My man'll pass a dime, at one five a pop
Tell shorty "make the drop, don't make no stops"
I gave him a hand shake, some dollars for the tab
Gave shorty the location then I hollered for a cab
I hit Mike told 'em "send the wire to the buyers"
Word got 'round like we was passin out flyers
And them things went as quick as they came
I'm back bein a hustler, this chick is to blame
I said them things went as quick as they came
I'm back bein a hustler, this chick is to blame
I miss you baby
I'll never do anything to hurt you
Twelve months in, turned a Benz to a Lambo
Everywhere the fam go, corks fly, cham' flow
I gotta celebrate hey!, that's the way I am yo
In the past week I watched fifty thousand grams go
Pocket full of money, army full of Rambos
Trunk full of bricks, hand guns full of ammo
Even got detectives if somethin goes wrong
The money's so strong, they see it from my perspective
But with my shorty, a nigga so protective
And should be, she the one who know where the connect live
She don't talk much, real calm and collective
Seen somethin in me 'cause shorty's very selective
I tell her fall back, shorty still'll drive
She said the rush of the risk just make her feel alive
I listen at her fuss, sayin that I must
Let her do it 'cause it ain't too many niggaz that I trust
So now time is flyin, I've been kind of eyein
A ring for my queen, who got me diamond buyin
I'm in the G T , headed up to CT
Lookin for a stone, light her finger like E T 
I got there, got a call from a DT
Sounded nervous what's up? sayin "we need to talk now"
What are you doin right now?
I told 'em "chill out, I ain't in New York now
Any problems I got, get traced in chalk now
But when I get back, we can meet and chit chat
Better not be no bullshit, I ain't even with that"
Now back to what a nigga came out here for
This five carat diamond without near flaw
Then head back to the city, call up the committee
Get ready for tomorrow, they comin in with fifty
I almost forgot, I gotta stop and see a cop
I figured it was a drop, who must ain't get his gwap
Told 'em meet me by the bridge, I get there in a hurry
Got me worried and it's probably just a minor mix up
He said "nah Los', Feds done snatched ya chick up
Caught her at a pick up, scoopin them bricks up
She gon' cooperate and a fix up
Probably at the headquarters now hangin flicks up"
I asked him "Was he sure?" Shorty's mi amor
This happened to me before with my man Diador, over a ki of raw
My nigga got killed, caps got peeled and I still got guilt
He assured me, I was hot, she had put 'em on me
Swore to Jesus' peers that he was here to warn me
Normally, I would have just ended her life
But this was the girl that I intended to wife
So I went home to shorty, had trouble sleepin
Shorty kind of peepin, my sudden discomfort
She woke up mad early, so I got up with her
Got dressed and told her I would hit the spot up with her
She wanted to go alone but a nigga insisted
Like "baby it's been a while and truthfully I missed it"
We rode out but she don't know that I done made a plan
When she hit the spot, close shot, see you later man
I watched her in the building
Knowin it's the last time, seein her ass climb in and out of the car
Yo I even thought about gettin out of the car
But sat back, lookin at the ring about to be yours
I let one tear fall at an unfair call
Ya whole life can change in just one year y'all
Caught in a thought, then I heard a
Hi love, bye love, I will miss my love
I miss you baby
It's so crazy how it happened like
You know
I will never do anything to hurt you
It's just
It's crazy
It's just crazy you know?
It's just the way it happened it's just
One thing
Ain't no love in this shit
Ain't no love in this game
There's no love
I heard this nigga be right here man
Up in some bitch crib up here man on third floor
Gangsta  Yeah he come out this building
Gangsta  I'ma warm his ass up
So this nigga playin with the money man, the fuck?

I'm waitin on my green like I'm sittin at a red light
Yeah the big nigga better have my bread right
Heard if the head right, nigga there e'ry night
Saw him outside in the ride, no headlights
Turn the engine down man Got the semi 9 with the red light
He gon' give me mine, or he dead aight?
It's a dead night and nobody on the block
There's nobody out here and shit man
In the morning John Doe body on the block
Leave these nigga right here
I went crazy on the day I got the fuckin call
This nigga and his bitch shoppin in the fuckin mall
WHAT?! The fuck he doin in that, fuckin mall?
I'm blowin up his phone, pussy nigga duckin calls
This nigga owe me
Spendin my money on his slut who suckin balls

Heard the nigga club poppin bottle after bottle
Whatever car he in, that's what Rollo have to follow
Can't wait to walk up, pop him hollow after hollow
Pass me that shit son, now here this nigga go
I came for the moneyI ain't here to play wit y'all
I caught him walkin out the building slow, quickly I draw the toast
Shoulda saw his face, looked like he saw a ghost
He kept backin up, I'm tryin to draw him close
He's sayin "Chill! I know what I got for you Los'"
"Give me a little time, a nigga got jammed in jail"
"You know my fam Jamel, look like Sam Casell"
"Got an op with like 900 grams a scale"
"On 7-5 North, Alabama sale"
I don't know the nigga, don't give a as well
You no  Negotiator  and I ain't Samuel
I squeeze two then the chamber got jammed with shells fuck!
And they say life is a gamble well
Fuck this shit I'ma kill this nigga man
Guess today was his lucky day
He gotta move now, I know where the fuck he stay
Taste his little chicken fried the Kentucky way
Bet if I flash that, she know where the stash at
That bitch know where that money at man Gangsta
That's what we gon' do, we gon' lay on this bitch
This nigga gon' come through here Gangsta
That's it man, this nigga playin with the money

Watch the name you say y'all, I may call, back
Once you see that K y'all, they fall, back

A nigga got impaired vision, there isn't
a person who can slow mine, I don't pay them no mind
I just can't see it, baby girl I'm so blind
Busy on my dope grind, I don't see no sign

Hater you can posted this, I got a phone nigga

But my nigga's on the trigger and the gun is on his thigh
Wait for one of them to try, that's when one of them'll die
There's a lot of pussy niggaz but not one of them is I

In the hospital, you can find 'em by I, C-U

Nah she don't see him, no we don't see them
And you know mine roll like they wear a blindfold
She won't let son in, she keep the blinds closed
I remind hoes, we don't do the man starin
It's about us, the rest of y'all are transparent
Like my grandparents, I'ma need my glasses
I don't see nobody fly as my conceited asses
We don't see nobody man I swear to God like
I'm really Ray Charles in this
Like if you want to be seen let yourself be seen man
Fuckin saga pieces of shit man

And everyday I get the benny wash
It's Deja Vu like Denny Wash
Budget too big, Billionaire a hurt a label
Play it tight, Spray the creed on the purple label
Pave settings, Jacob got me linked up
The Bentley wag bulletproof like a Brinks truck
C B L, We don't care what ya homies sell
Rubberband 'round the stacks like a ponytail
I could meet a hoe sweeter than Damita Joe
She act conceited tho, her numba get deleted yo
I'm not a musician, But I play an instrument
The ragin bull handle any kind of incident
The black latex, D's can't get the print
The flyin spur so fly, I had to get the Bent
Got initails on the door scrap what else, Initials on the floor mat what else
I ain't braggin homeboy, this my format
The 22's look like they ridin on 4 flats
Young octopus, I carry arms I charter challengers
With cavali carry-ons Freck the Billionaire
I'm the 1 with the bling
Got canaries on the wrist, not the ones with the wings look
A real hood nigga, I got a lavish flow
I could put you in the theaters like Magic though
You don't want beef, You just want raps
I get ya lil ass smoked like a blunt wrap
C B L spray, What da fuck did you thought
I tote the cig, But I don't mean Newport
I wash my money up the laundry way
I stay Gucci down even on my laundry day
The linen clean, Splash ya grenadine
Double blue 62 smash ya limousine
You could set trip, But I got the ammo near
Like a bad alibi, switchin up the Lambo gears
These other rap niggas, They couldn't hold a candle near 
They got it all screwed up, lLike chandeliers
I'm gettin money is my quotation
Family man, so I need the Lambo station
Slick talk will put a chamber into rotation
Director style, I shoot em on location
My hoe's hatian, trini and croatian
Ass clap louder than an Oprah ovation
Double D's on her chest like Daredevil

When you grow up in my hood
Help don't show up in my hood
Gang signs go up in my hood, just cuz you inmyhood
Feel like I'm trapped in my hood
Young kids get clapped in my hood
That's why I'm strapped in my hood, just cuz you inmyhood
Inmyhood, in my hood, in my hood
I'm always close to
feeling like a corner stander, stoop sitter, or hallway post-er
No matter where I go it's always 'posed to, feel just like I'm in my hood
Cops drive in it every 5 minutes, look at your faces, pat your waists'
Try to find the stash where the gats and base is, I can't say that they racist
But I knowit ain't the same in they town
And as fucked up as it may sound in my hood
it's 2 ways to make it happen off the streets
Balling on the courts or rapping off the beats
You hear the shells tappin' off the 'crete, when they clappin' off the heat
Then the yellow tape's trappin off the street
But that's the way we was raised
Preying to God, hoping that he keep us out the way of them strays
They drink 'til the cups dry, eat 'til the plate's clean
Niggaz be in state greens 'fore they turn 18
'Round here you never let the beef slide twice
Everybody raised on 4 wings and beef fried rice
Them mothers are getting younger today
Got one by the hand, one in the stroller and one on the way
We don't have role models
But we got them handguns that hold hollows in my hood
Ain't no diplomas or degrees
but you can get high from the aroma of the trees in my hood
I know it like navigation, and fuck having patience
I'ma get mine, you better get yours, cuz everyday is a struggle
And One-Time ride through everyday just to bug you
That's how it is, cuz your rights be wrong
And everybody got a white T on, when you're inmyhood
We try to make the most of what we got
You either been hit, or been close to gettin shot in my hood
Any nigga that boast be getting got
And dopeheads fiend to get a dose of what we got
and young niggaz be like they slow
But you give them a bluntbet they roll the weed like a pro
If you trick it's not a problem it gets you laid
But if you stick without a condom, it gets you AIDS
No Sesame Street, kids watch BET
Look up to niggaz that don't got a GED
I know a dude with the deadbeat tag
kids don't got diapers but he ridin' in the red G-Wag'
In the hood, you and your beef is sure to bump heads
and everybody grew up sleepin on bunk beds
They telling me to voteand I would

And I don't bring the problems from the 90's into 2 thou'
There's no reason to have a friend or two now
'Cause the kid's ready to tell you how he feel in a few vow's
Maybe, I'm speaking general now
But girl I'ma do whatever just to keep a grin on you now
Where I go, they wear bikini's in the winter too now

Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou'
On 5th Ave  shopping spree's, and them dinners to Chao's

Girl the way you cook a steak, remind me of those strips in Ruth Chris
You love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is
With you, it ain't because my whips is roofless
Or sit on chrome dipped dub deuces
And you ain't flattered by Canary envy es dipped Jesus'
Other ballers look dumb when they press you, five and sixes
You don't let them kinda numbers impress you
Even though I was somewhat successful
Bein' a player was becoming too stressful
But every since, the superwoman has come to my rescue
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special
Let's fly to St  Bart, while the villa be painted
Just so we can get really acquainted

Silencers, it sound like it's hummin' when I'm airin' ya

You ainít 'posed to bring her home, what you do? You show her in

Anybody in the streets know that that's a "no no"
So no I would never ever, ever, ever
Baby I'm a G, yeah that's right, the seventh letter
See one thing about the streets, I know where that heffa at
And I bet she always be exactly where I left her at
But you know we had a bond, no ring, no paper
And I don't hear this shit when I bring home paper
My ears to the streets streets, what you gon' tell us? tell us
You keep talkin down girl, you sound like you jealous
"Hi hunnie, I'm home"
She looked at me and said "it's 520somethin in the morní

Life is full of obstacles, we goní get you through this one
You looked me in my eye eye, when you told you was done
I played her for a fool but I guess I was the foolish one
Remember when she told me that she know how this dream ends
Late night phone call from one of my close friends
Tellin you that we are, rushin to the ER
By this time tomorrow, we were supposed to be in D R 
Me blowin a cigar, you sippin a 'tini
I told her pack her bags=2
0and don't forget her bikini
Then just like Houdini, it all disappeared
The escape to Paradise didn't end like this I swear
Sorry baby girl, I tried the best I could
If I can't be in the streets, I guess heavenís just as good
You finally got some off time
It's usually Sports Center for the fourth time
Tonight you came out of yours and I took off mine
Now we finally playing catch, got some back and forth time
Tossin' pillows, passin' blunts, caught a buzz
First time you gave me head was everything I thought it was, gonna be
You ain't got one degree
But you'll get a Ph D for that thing you've done to me
And tuggin' your dungaree, I wanted you under me
Wanted to spread them legs like you number 23
Maybe you wasn't ready, maybe it's under key
And it's some for them, and it ain't none for me
So we cuddle for a while, talk what you want to be
Some things we had in common and movies you want to see
He made her run to me, you played with one of these
Pretty young girls, ain't no tellin' what she gonna be
If she was my girl, might sound sprung of me
I'd give her everything like she had a gun to me

Had sushi for the first time, she tried the king
California tempura, ohh you tryin' things?

And you helped sell it like a fly ad
But you was mackin at the house, Ipad
Not mad, but there's a few disappointments
Let's just say that I canceled all the few appointments
I blew paper with you, not a joint bitch
I say bitch when I'm tryna make a point bitch
Other times I call it how I see it
I won't give you the title if you don't know how to be it
Which proves, I love it when the shits smooth
But show yo ass to yo nikka that's a bitch move
I'ma ride but what are you about yo
You gon pull a Trey and say let me out though
Never saw it coming, what a cheap shot
Your strongest enemies the one who know ya weak spot
Leave you, I never mean to
I kinda wonder if I cross ya mind
Maybe you my ex cause you crossed the line
Maybe you just never saw the crossing signs
Cause the hand up means don't walk
We don't talk
And somewhere there's a disconnection
You take it the wrong way so much misdirection
Baby what it is, tell me what it does
This is what it is, fuck what it was
But it was good while it lasted
But when its dead let it go, put it in a casket
And don't dig it back up
Got my swagga back up

To know a backstabber, you gotta turn ya back to ‘em
Well maybe its just me and I'm going crazy

Trees and a liquor blend, I be too queezy and sick to grin

Skeos say "can I get the keys to ya six again?"

And lets be real, catch me at the bar wit them crispy bills 
Gettin Cris' re-fills, my wrist be chilled
And my wardrobe look like I got an Ice Berg History deal
Still dames have been givin me slow neck

Ma you musta had too many weed totes
'Cause I ain't givin' you any C-notes 
I'm all about floatin' on them new skinny speed boats
Hundred and somthin wit two skinny deep throats

I don't sweat em', that's what I tell em'
And they quickly forget 'em, and I bet 'em
I get them to forget the day that they met 'em
And I let 'em cause I can spend 'em
And it's more then the denim
But I've been on the move, while you dudes be sleepin'
The coupe on 22's keepin shorty sneakin' in
She won't tell the truth she too used to creepin'
When Mike is in the booth it's the truth I'm speakin'
Any girl I gave it to, can't even go love another man
I give it to 'em like no other brother can
She say my man can barley move me
But boy you make me scream like a scary movie
On top of that, I'm smoother than the rest of the gangstas

Shorty don't try to fake it, just up and face it
Ya time is bein' wasted and ya man's a basic
See it all in his faces, he's cheap and tasteless
But life is what you make it just watch the bracelet
Bet ya man can't do it like me
His veins don't pump pimp fluid like me
He's nowhere near or like me
And he probably think keepin' you in check
Is buyin' you a pair of Nike's
Why wouldn't I, get dome from her
When the digits on my checks look like phone numbers
Fuck it, you might as well tell that busta skiddaddle
Not even Cochran can help 'em win this custody battle
Catch me in the club, wit a case of bub
And a thick chick to rub, niggaz hate because
When they sit in the truck, they be quick to fuck
And I'm gettin' a nut, they just lick it up
I'm their favorite, plus the flow is dangerous
I don't aim to get shorties our relationships

Shoutout the ones that were shady to me, that hate from ya'll probably made me do it
Knew they was doubt, never catered to it, love that dough like I'm a lady to it 
Comin' through with the family, they all related to me
Mommy say she love the boy, like she related to me
Feed her Rosé 'til she motivated, she from the Lou' so she motivated
Pay me to be here, pro-motivated, know we gon' ball, let's keep motivated let's get it
Crib is so out there, it feel like we hidin', so many cars I had trouble decidin'
on which one I'm ridin', but I never had trouble with knowin' who ridin' cause my niggas slidin'
We the base runners who beat out the throw they providin'
And tellin' that catcher that we had no problem collidin', just to get home safe 
Always believed that one day I'd be  B I G , I had my own  Faith 
All of my niggas gon' keep ridin' with me, 'til they get they own Wraith
I'm they motivation, I'm your motivation
Since  Superwoman , a Lil Mo-tivation, a lil motivation
Clap for a nigga, dap for a nigga, brrrat for a nigga
Coulda been a wrap for a nigga, coulda been a trap for a nigga
That's why I run laps for a nigga, find a way on a map for a nigga
Ain't no app for a nigga, like for real, you should be happy for a nigga
Motivation like for real, you should be happy for a nigga
Motivationthat it even happened for a nigga
All my love is all I have
All my life I look for you
I'm just Fab, I see how Mary be now
But I can barely be found
And I rarely be round
But when I do, the jury be drowned
And you can see how clear the Pavees, and the Canaries be now
The top on the 5 series be down
And I'm chillin' where them little houses on the prairie be now
Although there was a time I would barely see thous
But I'm gettin a multi-million dollar yearly fee now
Girls, don't even know me, want to marry me now
Dudes, I thought was homies, want to bury me now
That's why I keep a bulletproof vest, no matter where we be now
And I carry three pounds, and nearly three rounds
I take whatever the verdict from the jury be now
Rather than friends, it's pallbearers that carry me round
Everybody staring unnecessarily now
But there's no tints on my life, so you can clearly see now
All my love is all I have
And my dreams are very special
All my life I looked for you
And today your dream come true
You need me and I need you
Lovin us is very special
Lovin life and life and livin
Your very special
Ya'll can never be built like me, even if ya'll look at my blueprint
But since ya'll watches look like its movement
I'll show you how video games look on the new Sprint
Flip out digital screens, look in the new Bent
100 and flat screens, look in the new Pint
Even our Air Forces lookin' to new tints
I stay away from anythin that look like a nuisance
But ya'll gotta peep this rookie's improvement
I tip it with you and
Cause most dudes was doin verses for a few dollars and a hook for a few cents
All I do is try to teach and look to influence 
But it look like the students are playin hooky, and truin
And some say that we lookin' like new gents
But money talks, and it don't look like ya'll fluent
And ya'll done seen how this "Young'n" look in the new pints
But it's my life and you can't look in the new tints
Uh, If I could say so myself, I came a long way
Even though I feel like the same old John J 
Nothin' change, when I aim, I'm gonna spray
When I eat, I order the same old entree
When I ride, I let the same old songs play
And when I work, I do the same old long days
From bein' Fab, to looked at by dames the wrong way
They know where we came, from the name they call me
I already know what these lames is gonna say
And I already seen what games they gonna play
Fuck with family, don't say the name the wrong way
And when you die, ya'll crackers gonna blame it on strays 
Cause love and life, and life and livin
Your very special
Me and Fab are very special
Me and Fab are very special
Go hard, today
Can't worry about the past 'cause that ye-sterday
I'm a put it on the line 'cause it's my time
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Gotta stay on my grind 'cause it's my time hey
My time hey, my time hey

The past is the past, you know

My day, we gotta do it now
This what we've been waitin for right here y'all
This moment right here
It's my time, my time baby, come on
Guess what time it is?  My, my, my time
You can check your iPhone, better say it's our time
I don't even need a watch, I don't even see a clock
Soon as a I walk in, it feel like me o'clock what?
Yeah, me o'clock, everytime I check
Niggaz don't measure up and try to blame the Pyrex damn
I'm a do it bigger than a 5X
Can't ride with a L, so I don't drive Lex
Game's so bickery , so full of trickery 
Nursery rhyming, hickory, dickory
Blowin that sour, the hood call it pickery
Biggie, Puffy, Busta,  Victory , yes
My time's more like fly time
Don't call it gettin dressed, call it in the sky time
If you ain't a pilot, you probably couldn't style it yes
Unless you was a stewardess, you won't know what to do with this yes
First I took the time out, then I put the time in 
Money ain't everything, it's more about the timing the timing
So I got the Audemars, flawless diamonds yes
In other words that's called perfect timing woo
I feel like a favor , I feel like a savior 
They clockin my neck, I feel like I'm Flavor wow
I go so hard, Loso God God
Dance, scream, fid-di-di-di-damn
0-9, all mines
It's been a few years, now it's me, about time
You know I got committed with it since I've been up in the zone
Sign the dotted liiiine, now is on now it's on
So y'all better check your wrist piece why?
'Cause it's time to make history 
Just hop in here up on this hit streak
How the, how the, how the hell you gonna evict me? evict me, yeah
You know I'm here to stay, never cocky now
Big bottles we poppin now, no tellin where we stoppin now
And I represent the Chic-a-g-o
On the track with F-A-B-O, you know we
Uh, yes I am often imitated
But I am never duplicated, yeah
Yes I am often imitated
But I am never duplicated
I can't deny it, you's a dick rider
You can never flow like me, blow like me
Why would a bitch like ya?
She can see that I'm a fuckin rider, you a hitch hiker
I'm walkin in some shoes, they can't make fit ya
Got millions of paper that you can't take with ya
I don't wanna talk and I can't take pictures
Listen to your demo, I'll handshake with ya
Excuse you, who's you?
If I need a stunt double I'll use you
Pardon y'all, I don't wanna step on y'all toes
Seperate the authentic from the replica flows
And the kid be places you could never be at
So that can never be this, and this can never be that
These niggaz got some audacity
Sell some records as fast as me
Or sell some tickets out as fast as me
Motherfucker
Yes I am often imitated yes he is often imitated
But I am never duplicated but he is never duplicated
So all that y'all can do is hate it
None of these wannabes really come close
I feel like I'm watchin the MTV show Christina Milian hosts
Everybody know this brother got it
Way before everybody and their mother got it
They still wonder how he sound like he do
If I was you, I'd wanna sound like me too
'Cause I got M's, they got G's and they all right
But they not me
They hear how I spit it on a station
Now they wanna put me on they singles just to get an imitation
No, I can't make an appearance
Give you a cheap fee or break on a clearance
I'm what your label hoped it could be
That's why they trying to mould your little ass, into a sculpture of me
With the ladies it'll be like leader, she like real
Y'all trying to be like me and be like ill
So all that y'all can do is hate it
I'm real
It's the way I talk, the way I walk
It ain't my fault
I won't let nothin' on two legs stop me
'Cause the real is always better than the bootleg copy
Like I ain't show 'em the white and yellows at the same time
Throw backs and pin wheels at the same time
Like I'm scared to drop at the same time
I'll show you how to do this young'n
I ain't frontin'
These Jordan's ain't comin'
It ain't nothin'
Keep the complaints comin'
Can't hop on my bandwagon
Jump in my blue flames
You should not try, you are not I
It's the dude with the Grammy grin
It's no relation if it ain't a street family kin
So won't the real Fabolous please stand up
So all that y'all can do is hate it
If only I could see you again 
I will make sure that those days never end 
If only I could do it all again 
Just to have one more chance 
I'll never let it go 
I mean life's not like that though 
Sometimes you only get one shot 
Most times, yeah 
Don't you hate a could of, would of, should of nigga? 
Could of did, would of did, well you should of nigga nigga 
I am never on the iffy shit 
You see her with me, you ain't gotta wonder if he hit 
My daddy was a player too, Ken Griffey shit 
He said kill these hoes and get the death certificates haha 
So when I do me, I over do it 
In the red Rover sendin bitches over to it 
Might use the Caddy, part-time golfer 
But act now I'm a limited time offer 
And I'm off the, chain like a stray dog 
If I want it, I'm a fetch it, I don't play dog I don't play dog 
I see the game from a sick angle 
New York had a chance, the bitch pick Tango 
In my case you get one opportunity 
Minus convertible, so let's call it drop-tunity, haha 
Get a slice of the pie now, you wait 'til the pizza's cold 
Then you sayin what you  Shoulda  did like Keyshia Cole 
 I Should Have Cheated  nah, I  Shoulda Let You Go  nah 
I just shake 'em off , Etch A Sketch a ho haha 
I draw a blank, back to the drawing board 
I'm like Michael Jordan if we talkin scorin broads damn 
To me you got one chance to miss ya shot  
Better get ya J up , life is not a layup nah 
Meanin, sometime they make it hard 
Like a straight dude, naked broad get on top of me 
Why give an inch if she can take a yard? woo 
You land on "Chance," take a card, it's Monopoly 
I think past "Go" , 200 on my mental dash though 
And my foot is on the gas ho 
If opportunity ain't there, make one 
They ain't give me a chance, so I had to take one, Los' 
Niggaz be lookin at shit that's right in front of 'em man 
They don't even see their chance is right in front of 'em 
You know? It's fucked up 
I look at Obama and I more than glance 
I don't just see change, I saw a chance 
How many hustlers do you know waitin for a chance? 
Some pedal more than Lance in the Tour de France 
How many convicts inside waitin for a break? 
That's rare, short time, waitin for a steak 
How many shooters holdin heat, waitin for a shot? 
Fall asleep in the car waitin for a shot 
Sniper's in D C , I know what he see 
I'm tryin to put you on to it, Cici 
Just ate fried chicken, I took greasy 
I told this bitch I'm a Mac/Mack not a P C  haha 
I sit niggaz down, don't let 'em stand a chance 
Only way you squares ride is a ambulance 
Kill 'em while you got a chance in a Bronco 
Or it comes back in the end, Benny Blanco, yes 
Rick Rock, I took my masters baby
I'm here to shake up the world, yeah uh
This is the digiwax remix
Ras Kass, Ghetto Fab, Fresh
This is the Man Show

Get riches, hit dro, drink a dee coup
Had a bad bitch from the dirty south
With a good tooth like Lou
If the answer's no, you a man ho
Probably no more
All captain say hand cuff and stop
Let them go, rass kass will play it though

Ras kass you can't get caught with fabolous government
Put my face on the passport
Cuz real niggas do real things

Cuz ya'll mean

I'm fly enough, to do better,
But pimp enough to not give a fuck,
And I'm thug enough, to do better,
And gangsta enough to not give a fuck,
I'm hustlin' enough, to know better,
But ballin' enough to not give a fuck,
And I'm, old enough, to know better,
But young enough to not give a fuck
I'm in a throwback so old
It'll make your grandma glance
And everybody know, everybody go
So please, call the stretch ambulance
These dudes don't stand a chance
When I pull up like the pamper brand
Those in the Lambo slants
With a madame from France
With a ass so big
You couldn't hide it in hammer pants
Who else be in New York
With Miami tans
Got everybody doin' the street family dance
I'm sure this hammer can
Make you save that gangsta role for the camera man
F-A-B, you preferably
Don't wanna F wit me
Please believe it

For gettin' the City High as 'Clef would be
Believe it please
Snap cap Lou, you know it's me
Leroy, wrist on glow for all to see
Fresh trep for all the see
You can tell by my strut, I'm a new yorker baby
What that mean, never leave or maybe
I'm dropping off Felciia, I'm gettin' toss to keyes
Drink up the coffee, break fast after breakfast
Hoppin' in the goleta, make back is gettin' respected
Niggas must be gay, I aint thinkin' straight
I'm in the quarter before eight
Mama I can't relate, like when we goin' shoppin'
When she starts speakin French
Leave them alone like Stockton
Fresh, Ras, and Fab, please with the gift to gab
Put your potato, we ready to mash
Don't get involved, I put your top in front of the E
So you really be ahead of your class
And you know niggaz know
But they act like they don't know
Y'knahmean like

This the Triangle Offense
Ghetto Fab
Paul Cain, Joe Buddens
We all "Street Dreams"
At one time or another
Fast cars, cash
Money, hustlin 
C'mon y'all
Desert Storm
Some niggas thug, and some niggas is bitch
Some niggas'll rob, and some niggas'll pitch
Some niggas ain't got shit, some niggas rich
Some niggas do the time, and some live as a snitch
Now some niggas like to pull out and talk, some niggas pop off
Some niggas found they way to the top, some niggas got lost
Some niggas keep it thorough in jail, some niggas got soft
Some niggas ride hard top Coupe, I pull the top off
And quick to speed off on the jake
Quick to back, any nigga gettin money, come up off of the safe
Fuck the city, I'm extortin the state
I'm like O  from the "Wire", walk wit a sawed-off and a  8
When I was taught, never talk wit a snake
When you kill a nigga you love, you pay for the coffin and weight
Get you wrapped up, and tossed in a lake
If you can't get the whole pie, just take ya portion and skate
Don't fuck wit niggas, if they soft or they fake
Only jail cats, and niggas going back and forth to court could relate
Fuck wit me, and I'ma alter ya fate
Send some wolves after ya girl, I specialize in torture and rape
We in the game most dudes ain't built for
Cain talk the type of shit, niggas get killed for
Whatever it's gon' be, let it be, I ain't waistin a slug
And time is money, and when it come to mind, take it in blood, nigga
Some niggas thug, and some niggas is bitch
Some niggas rob, and some niggas'll pitch
Some niggas ain't got nothin, some niggas rich
Some niggas do the time, and some live as a snitch
These niggas act like, I ain't sling the clip at the last lane
And ran to the cops, to bring the tips of the last names Nigga!
Like I ain't bring the shipments, and past caine
And sticky that'll leave ya finger tips wit the grass stains Nigga!
Like I don't swing and zip through the fast lane
Would you believe, this ringer chipped me a fast Range Nigga!
Like I ain't sling on stips, till my past fame
And stacked it up, like the Pringle chips, when the cash came Nigga!
Like I ain't fling and dip, when the task came
I knew these niggas sing like pits, so I stash change
The singles chipped in my ass changed
But this player never pay for, them rings and whips, just to gas dance
I'm why you stay in touch wit ya writer
Even made you pick up ya pen, and start clutchin it tighter
I ain't much of a fighter
But I know, everything about rollin up, like a Dutch in a Spyder
My dope is much more than whiter
One hit'll have the fiends yellin out, they need crutches and lighters
The Fed's can't touch us indict us, and the hoes can't even get numbers
They wanna stay in touch, they could write us, nigga
Some niggas thug, and some niggas is bitch
Some niggas rob, and some niggas'll pitch
Some niggas ain't got shit, some niggas rich
Some niggas do the time, and some live as a snitch
Listen, listen, I lived that life, of click-clack life
The kidnap life, the kid's the wise, I did that twice!
You prolly see that through ya bitch ass eyes
Still I'm that nigga that you get at why
Man forget that they knew me, remeber me thug
I'm from that same block, rips snorkle on ja dip in a Lucy
'Member they back you down, when knives was out
 45 was out, scully ya eyes come out
But now could you hear nigga all in this place
That when you see him in the streets, you gettin all in his face
More you give a nigga, the more that he takes, and you wanna beef
Knowin I'm slower than do so, cause I got much more at stake
HUH!? that's why I'm ignorin ya page
I can't respect you no more, you's a fraud and a snake
But you noticed that's the hate that I love
You see me eating off rat, that same feat you think you capable of
Don't get me worng, I would like to get it
But you acting like, I ain't blow my show money on a rifle fetish
And my pop's voluntarily, surrendered to the Fed's
This is the wrong time to fuck wit my head
I'm tryna tell you, friends are ya worst enemies
So if I make friends wit my worst enemies, that'll maybe even things out
But one in ya dome is easy, get it on if need be
Chrome for sheezy, please, DON'T believe me
Some niggas thug, and some niggas is bitch
Some niggas'll rob, and some niggas'll pitch
Some niggas ain't got nothin, some niggas rich
Some niggas do the time, and some live as a snitch, nigga
I'm here to shake up the world
Right, rightghetto
I'm something like a phenomenon
But still dumpin whenever the dramas on
Ya'll hustlas can't eat fit meals and it feels
Something like when it's Ramadan
Hope you chumps been walkin wit armor on
I'm who they dumpin two colahamels on
Oh somethings turning his mama on
I love to see rumps in Farragama thongs
Bet it look dope when you got pajamas on
Jump in, lets hit the Bahamas ma
And it's crunk whenever I'm on a song, bumpin like bump bu-bump
I'm particulary picky
When it come to licky licky
Have em slidin off them vickies quickly o k 
Under the du-rag thick 360
It's the hypno and sticky icky I said o k 
Fly enough to do better but pimp enough to not give a fuck
Dumb enough to do better and gangsta enough to not give a fuck
Im hustlin enough to know better but ballin enough to not give a fuck
Im old enough to know better but young enough to not give a fuck
I'm in a throwback so old it'll grandma glance
And everybody know
everybody go, so please call a stretch ambulance
these dudes don't stand a chance
when I pull up like the pamper brand
those under lambo slants?

wit a ass so big you couldn't hide it in hammer pants

I'm introduced to yo women friends hello
Cuz I buy double deuces to rent a benz 
Like them bootz made by timberland
Not half them were mine, since I got drafted and signed
Ya'll players get used to the scrimmagin
Not one of them jesus' got lemon gems?
You knowYa'll lips gonna get loose like ya feminine
I prove lettin with the semi can
Boost my adrenaline
You'll never have use with that hand again
Half of my roots is Dominican faboloso
Me gusta le bejamins
This dude got the juice of a pimp in him
I'm turning stones like medusa had glimpse of them
But right now you can lie and gossip to
And later on be the guy who the mobs? look to
And right now you can try and prosecute
But later on you gon die in the hospital
Niggaz ain't gon' be happy till I click on a rage
Pick up a gauge, and it's my face, that they stick on front page
Gotta be careful, I could pull a thick of the age
Chick on the stage, and winde up, sick in a cage
When I come through, it's usually in Dickies that's beige
Pushing a "Eleanor", like I'm Nicholas Cage
And it's funny how a few bucks can
Get you put under a white sheet, like you in the Ku Klux Klan
It's Street Fam' for life, we ride to the death
We play hard dog, don't cry to the rest
I don't know you, please move to the left
Or stay here and get introduced to the tefs
I'm riding till the wheels come off it 
Grindin till a mil' come off it 
This is my plate, I eat every meal from off it
Why y'all try and steal crumbs off it, jump!
Now ride Top down, chrome rims spinnin and
Now ride Gun cock, hollows in the clip now
Now ride Chop rocks, put it on a strip now

Now when I spray wit the sauer, I gotta spend a day wit the lawyer
Worryin bout, who say that saw ya
Keep yay wit the oyers, two kids on the block
Like when Mourning and Mutumbo, used to play wit the Hoyas
I'ma boss, that you can never upstand
Or get a red dot on you, like a 7Up can
Some of y'all caught feelings from way back
Others waited till I came through, short willing the Maybach
But I'm still bucking like, five, duce, four, trey
Still tucking and letting the fo' spray
Still ducking where ever the po's lay
And still fucking, and making them hoes say, WHOA!
 And I know Fed's seen
The old school Chevy, with the dope head lean
Y'all love the way I R-I-D-E
Call my D E , and put you on a R I P T , ghetto
Uh, they call me G-H-E-T-T-O, nigga
Uh, uh, I'm back on that bullshit
Haha, who could fuck around? Huh? uh
I bet you look at things from a different perspective
When you see the size of the slugs, the fifth or the tech get
A couple'll lift a detective
And make sure the legs that he used to walked with is defective
All you niggas do is sit on blocks and jive
About who's the baddest bitch and if Pac's alive
Nigga, I'm in a aqua five
With a button that make the roof flip back like pocket knives
I can't knock ya drive, you feelin' like Rocky
Till you get a beatin' like he got in Rocky 5
The squad'll still hold toast, and get these bitches
To open they legs wider than a field goal post
Broke niggas don't wanna stand my grind so they knock it
Think my jeans got Mickey D's signs on my pockets
The hydro combined with, the chocolate have ya eyes
Lookin' like the tall dude who signed with the Rockets
The flow is so sick, sooner or later
These niggas gonna need barf bags bigger than golf bags
The coke get flew on planes monthly
And cops search me for weapons harder than they do in Hussein country
And any chick that get a view of the chain wit me
I guess that's what Jay meant by chain reactions
Bitch! It's nothin' to thumb off some notes
Fuck a dealer, I get 'em when they come off the boat, fucka
Yeah, Ghetto 
Fab, nigga, uh
Uh, Street Family
Uh, pay attention, y'all
Please, uh, yeah
You could love Fab, hate Fab, I don't care
Send ya clothes with the check or I don't wear
Street Dreams the mixtape, uh huhyeah
Uh, let's get this money, y'all
Let's get this money, y'all
It's easy to look at my life and don't see no pain
I remember takin 3, 4 trains to re cocaine
Standing in the lobby during sleet, snow, rain
Waiting for fiends with a pint of beef lomain
Breaking day on the grind, I used to be so drained
But ain't a Saturday I wasn't up to see Soul Train
Sometimes I ain't see no gain
cause I was runnin to Ralphies everytime my trees showed stains
I was lucky I ain't seized or maim
Get shot or stuck up standin at them cee-lo games
But now shit with these skios changed
I ain't know why the fuck they used to look at me so strange
Glanced at my neck and didn't see no chain
Be saying "That's nasty," wouldn't give me no brain
Y'all surprised F-A-B-O's sane
In my road to life I done jumped in and outta 3, 4 lanes
I'm still here
My momma used to tell me
"Son, you're gonna make it one day, it'll happen"
Who knew I had what it takes to be famous
and one day I'd be rappinthough
my papa used to ask me "Son, are you prepared?
Cause one day it could happen"
I dreamed about this game, but who would've believed
that one day I'd be trapped indough
I just want some peace of mind
Niggas will risk havin cuffs on their wrists
for this masterpiece on mine
Know that I'm a squeeze until the top of my piece recline
I can't see myself in back of a Caprice confined
But on a small island, too far for police to find
With girls who look 'Rican and Guyanese combined
I gotta make sure my niece is fine
She get every doll for Christmas, new Jordans at Easter-Time
Some be like "At least you signed"
But that just make is easy to get pointed out at precinct lines
All ya'll can see if every piece be dime
And I be gettin Nikes before they even get released sometime
Youngsters, don't let these videos geese your mind
It ain't cool to end up deceased for shine
And if you can't get the whole pot, just take a piece and grind
Hold your head, your stress will cease in time
Sometimes I wish I could go way back when
I could walk thru and ain't nobody know Jay Jackson
Everything was OK back then
Now everybody playin a cool role and I know they actin
I gotta go back through my ol' way packin
These wolves know my jewels is filled with O'Shea Jacksons
I don't care as long as my dough stay stackin
But these niggas with me be eager to show they Mack 10s
And I'm the one the PO's stay trackin
Plus I got all these ducks around the ol' way quackin
These hoes may crack grins
but I swear to God I won't never take O J's actions
If I would've let this flow stay packed in
I'd probably be with Nick and 'Rome, spending my whole day shacked in
For now I just roll on those eight Jacksons
One day it'll happen
That One day I'd be rappin
One day it could happen
One day I'd be trapped in
Powder
She said I wanna hold you down but we ain't never 'gon be right Never 'gon be right
'Cause you too caught up in the street life Caught up in the street life
But that's the only life I know oh oh oh oh!
She said them niggas that's around you they ain't never 'gon be right Never 'gon be right
'Cause everybody wanna be Mike Everybody wanna be Mike
Instead of focusin on they own, own, own, own dough
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Powder!
But this the only life I know oh oh oh oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Powder!
But this the only life I know oh oh oh oh!
They say a woman cancel dates 'cause she has to
And a man cancel dates 'cause he has two
Well I got two dates, one with destiny
I need more baby don't think any less of me
Tryin to juggle, slowly became a struggle
Sometime I wanna hug the block sometime I wanna hug you
Sometime it's 'bout the check, sometime it's 'bout checkin that
Dinero said you gotta leave in thirty seconds flat Word!
When the heat's comin even if you meet someone
Leave it in the rear view don't look back keep runnin
Left her in the passenger, with the jeep runnin
Hazard lights blinkin and the beat bumpin
Ear to the streets I hear the sweeps comin
Ear to yo' chest so I hear a beat from it
She fell in love with a street nigga
Tattoo my name on her petite figure
She said I wanna hold you down but we ain't never 'gon be right Never 'gon be right
'Cause you too caught up in the street life Caught up in the street life
But that's the only life I know
She said them niggas that's around you they ain't never 'gon be right Never 'gon be right
'Cause everybody wanna be Mike Everybody wanna be Mike
Instead of focusin on they own, own, own, own dough
Powder!
But this the only life I know
Powder!
But this the only life I know!
There's always money to be made that you can't deny
I always made mine never one who can't decide
I'm only human so if I don't eat I can't survive
And mama said your not a man if you can't provide
The son must know a shortcut it beats me whole
I work so hard to get here now it keep me gone
By the time I get in what she made to eat be old
When I slide in bed she complain my feet be cold
'Caught up in the street life just like my bitch said
I love the game I love the hustle just like Mitch said
Yeah I could leave the game, but is they still 'gon love me?!
And when that new nigga come, they 'gon stop thinkin of me
Shorty watch the hustler movie she can never get
How they make so much money, but they never quit
I tell her quit for what that's the only life they know
The streets a dirty hoe, niggas try to wife it though
She said I wanna hold you down but we ain't never 'gon be right Never 'gon be right
'Cause you too caught up in the street life Caught up in the street life
But that's the only life I know oh oh oh oh!
She said them niggas that's around you they ain't never 'gon be right Never 'gon be right
'Cause everybody wanna be Mike Everybody wanna be Mike
Instead of focusin on they own, own, own, own dough
Powder!

Powder!
But this the only life I know
Yo Drama! Yo
It's a pleasure rockin wit'chu my nigga you my nigga
Don't say we didn't warn ya
Cause a lot of shit be happenin they'd be like
"Nobody told us! Where the fuck did they come from?"
I'm lettin it be known 
Street Fam is it nigga
Y'all niggaz stay tuned
A thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers, Pachanga
P-P-P-P-P-P-P-Pachanga , P-P-P-P-P-P-Pachanga
Yo everything ain't love love, 'cause if it is
My definition of love must differ his
I mean every friendship has its differences 
But these Young Bucks remind me of Fif' and his damn
They hear the good life, wanna see what the difference is okay
Some just wanna smoke, enjoy the piff-leges haha
He unwrap a cigar like it's a gift of his
He a funny little nigga like Eddie Griffin is what?
Between smokin and jokin then you got to live 
So I gave him a chance and that's a lot to give
You 'posed to make the most of what you was paid to gross
I gave you bread and butter you supposed to make the toast
Fifteen years, FIFTEEN YEARS!
And now when we say "what's up?", the shit seem weird so weird
But there's a question I prepared for you what's that?
How could you fuck the only people who ever cared for you?
A thug changes
A thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers, Pachanga
P-P-Pachanga, P-P-Pachanga
There's a parallel path 'tween friends and enemies 
And whenever you cross it you make frienemies 
There's no remedies for these sick memories
My doctor said there's no cure for the Emilys damn
Had a  Crush On You , now we Kim and Cease
We don't even talk no more, it's no Biggie
I was so Biggie, you was Faith
I let you slide in my home, you was safe
I thought my ability to provide you stability
Was what was really G, okay silly me silly me
I was Billy Dee, smooth cat but really street
Really she attract niggaz like the  A Milli  beat
And I happen to rap but somethin 'bout this beat strange
Soon as I try to flow with it, the beat change
Never thought she change never
But what you thinks a upgrade really just could be a seat change
Love changes
See when the love is gone then it's just B S  left
Just niggaz with chains on tryin to be S F 
That's when your ace  coom ya B F F 
Who Pachange ya like they was a P F  chef
 D-D-D-Danger , it just feels Mystikal
I miss the cool nights sittin in the Carlo
Now it's like "boooo" we sittin in Apollo
It used to be all good, then shit just went malo
And that's bad, matter fact that's sad
'Cause when you lose a friend it's hard to handle the loss
They do some bitch shit, gotta give ya man a divorce
End up watchin "Friends" like Joey, Chandler and Ross
Ya see, most of these niggaz ain't never love 'em never love 'em
And these bitches just think whatever of 'em whatever of 'em
So maybe playin dumb was kinda clever of 'em
And less friends are your best friends become strangers
I'm old enough to know better, young enough to not give a fuck
Rather hold my high and die then live and duck
If you're cool being taken down and giving up
Your lifestyle's a blow job, the way you're living sucks!
I done felt pain, waited but no help came
Went through some crazy shit still kept myself sane
You ever been dying of thirst and smelt rain
Ever been told "go to hell" and felt flames
The water's to your neck and only gets deeper
Its all down hill and it only gets steeper
Gotta get over it, be a hurdle leaper
It cost to be the boss, it ain't get no cheaper
But there's a man above that we all under bro
No bread truck but he work wonders though!
After you wake up, everything is wonderful
You can overcome anything you undergo
As an artist I'm just tryna paint the perfect picture
But see where tryna wait for somebody that's perfect gets you
That usually lead to nothing like virgin kisses
And I be tryna cut, surgeon bitches
Dreams of splurging riches, pretty but curvy misses
Chef to serve the dishes, driving to swerve the ditches
I'm just another kid on the purple wishes?
And the streets is tough, on the verge of viscious
So I sold weed and crack, business
That white girl helped a nigga, Fergalicious
But getting money bring jealousy and verbal disses
So when you killin' shit watch out for the murder witness
An old head told me, let nothing disturb your business
Beef is only good when you in the burger business
So I chilled, but loaded up the steal
Like I wish a nigga would, But I know a nigga will
But for real you loaded up to kill
Cause soon as a nigga could the sooner a nigga will
And I don't owe these niggaz nothing
Put that in a nigga will
They call me Paperman, I get that paper man
Your shorty starin homie, don't make me take her man
But I'm just on the low, and you already know
Yo' bitch choosin Pimpin, that's just the way it go
They call me Paperman, Paperman, in that brand new Chevy Sedan
My money stack up so tall, like New York skyscrapers man

This player is good at home, like Kobe in Staples man
They call me Paperman, Paperman, in that brand new Chevy Sedan

This player is good at home, like Kobe in Staples man
He be tryin to lock her down, she tryin to escape the man
I pick that paper up in the mornin she is like my paper stand
They say money shapes a man, keep them squares out your circle
And work yo' money nigga just don't let yo' money work you
I'm a man to blow two grand or so on sneakers made from animal
Even if they don't understand the flow, bet them hoes understand the dough
Every motherfucker on this planet know, money keeps the world on spin
If I put the spur on in, ain't no doubt yo' girl gone grin
They like my shine they like my grind
I take yo' girl, I bring her back, ain't like she mine
Your hoe's to blame you know the game
It's 'Loso Rich but if you wanna know the name I say
Now I dip through strips in a whip
On black 22's and chrome on the lip
Don't slip, don't trip cause the tips are hollow
in this chrome on my hip
I lean so mean, so clean
that there ain't a stain on these clothes
Hoes run don't stunt the ones
We makin it rain on these hoes
I ride through slow, just hide yo' hoe
Don't let yo' girl see 'Loso
I think I'm this, I think I'm that
Man I don't think I know so
I let them know, we let them go
So please don't play wit them boys
She wanna come, just let her come

Gangsta
Uh, the Big Wills sittin on big wheels
Brooklyn's back, imagine how Big feel
What else?! Yeah I am a big deal
Tell 'em keep the change, when I break big bills
Talk is cheap, everyone could afford it
This for the hustlers, everyone should applaud it
Get'cha camera phone, everyone should record it
I'm the pizza man, I delivers the orders woo
Arm &, Ham-in-mer-ham-and-the-grits
Homey I'll cut your wrist off, put your hands on my grits
See I'll be the convict, I am fully committed
Took my shoes off and laughed, they couldn't fit it
What else?! If I don't do nuttin I'm a ball
Fall through your city, shut down the mall
That all?! I'm Tupac with it, I got the "Juice"
Soldier, but only the gangsters I salute
It all started out in Brooklyn
Yeah, but the kid kept it movin
Uhh, I came along way from hustlin

Here on the Eastside, we be paper touchin
Here on the Westside, we be paper touchin
She's sick of that song, how it's so long
since she met a G like me
First it was Kane, then it was Big, then it was Jay
And she love the homey F-A-B, now meet me
It's R Flow-riffic, white flower I whip it
Spin it round and round, stand on my pivot voila
Keep that white girl, Christina Aguilera
I seen the king soon as I got a mirror
What else?! Gettin fresh and lettuce be my fetish
Retired with the chip like Je-rome Bettis
I wonder, if I stacked Bread like Wonder
Would my Woman's first name be Wonder?
When it come to me they are Stevie Wonder
They can't see I, I am B I G 's student
Make 'em holla it's movin
Make 'em light up and get to boozin
Hey zukon you know I gotta diddy bop to this one
Paper touchin
Why not? My nigga Red Cafe!
Paper touchin
Having nothin' was the worst, now it's the best of everything
They used to tell us no, now it's yes to everything
And I get high on the low, just the level things
The worst I look, probably the best you've ever seen
Yeah, so fresh, and forever clean
Produce sexy style, bein' fresh is everything
I sit yo ass down girl, sit that heavy thing
Give me that sloppy head, and make a mess of everything
If they don't see that I'm a winner, then it's their loss
I say fuck niggas, then you won't hear, pause
We work hard all day, over here boss
So every night we go ball like hair loss
From the bottom, but we end up being top notch
Thinkin' out the box where everybody hopscotch
Everybody knows
How the story goes
Friends turn into foes
Seen it all before
Guess I'll take the blame
Cause you and me ain't the same
For what it's worth, nigga really can't complain
Payback some motherfucker, I would hate to be ya
I'm back to lay ya flat like a quesadilla
Crocodile, heard Mase kick collectors items
Fugitive, by the state, had to expedite him
I'm back to put the game on Ramadan
Like grated cheese, a six-deuce parmesan
Compared to other captain, Philly Freck a day less
That's absolutely negative, like my AIDS test
I'm gettin' chauf, I'm in the back with a leisure
Tell the driver go long, like a Packer's receiver
I still got the most hoes, it's affirmative
Every boss hotter then the furnace is
Heard Freck fuckin' with the chick? Now he wanna
He search for 'em, then he cuff 'em, he's a bounty hunter
They make the ugly face when he raps
I'm back on that shit like a relapse
Y'all niggas better stop playin with me
Y'all know ya aint bout that life
"SOUL tape"
niiiccee
I'm callin them out
I got they phone numbers 
When that money callin everything gon on hold 
I'm having doubts, what they really believe
Starting with these Stefan Urquelle, who really be Steve
Photoshop dont make it better, it really deceive
Long hair dont care, but it really be weave
Lets get back to this real shit
That life, I'm bout
Anytime that I'm out, I keep ballin like there's no time out
On the kush I'm stoned out
On you haters, I zone out
Y'all opinions dont make me money
So what yall thinkin dont count
I mean the nerve of these niggas giving me attitude
When I be serving these niggas
You rappers platter food
Saying they overrated is a understatement
Them niggas is broke, look like they under maintanence
They rapping bout mansions, but from they momma's basement
Swear they in phantoms, but drive a honda station
Lets get back to this real shit
Stay away from that counterfeit
That fake-it till you make-it life, really dont amount to shit
Talkin never bothers us, sometimes it do bore me
So if ya makin movies, hope it based on a true story
Freck said "nothings worse than a rich hater"
When money call, pick it up n call that bitch later
You know all we do is count money and touch bitches right?
Gangsta Grillz 
The money on the wood, the B on the hood
So what I talk I live, let it be understood
The smell is so good, Presidential on the street
You know a nigga never put a pencil on the beat
Freak, Irish Spring fresh, at the SpringFest
Perfect attendence, motherfucker we bling best
Huh? This a bossed up king set

Can't be stoned I'm high as the Sears Tower
Live by the code, ride don't dare cower
24 straight hours I'm Jack Bauer
Punish the block, with the milk white powder
Enough water to give the borrough a light shower
Enough hammers to drip drip and cause thunder
I'm just here to get the  Bread  I ain't talkin  Wonder 
But the feds takin pictures of me
They lean like it's on syrup need a picture of me
Yeah, I'm so Brooklyn, I scream April pay

Most niggaz'll stash 'em, I'd rather tuck 'em

And ten drive right past 'em, like motherfuck 'em
See the game's like Wall Street
I watch the ups and downs like the stock betters
I'm Velveeta with it, still gettin block cheddar
I'm with the rock shredders, Glock out of the box getters
Come through like Katrina, they call 'em the block wetters
thanks to the rock setters
I'm shinin, reclinin on this Maybach's leather
I'm in the Rich Young mock sweater, block letters
Nike Airs, croc leather, who rocks better
Ask Greg Street 'bout the Las Veg' suite
The Presidential joint with the Ronald Reag' sheets
They either throw salt, or think it's nutmeg sweet

It's 'Loso Croft, You can call me Tomb Raider
We break in homes, we the living room raiders
Snatch wifey, come back for the groom later
Throw her in the back of the van like she on "Room Raiders"

They come with AK's dawg, like it's Kuwait dawg
All we, know is, B I T E , we a-ggressive, sharks 
Don't you, ask us, nothin', fuck a, question, mark
Flyest, nigga, in it, spit the, freshest, bars
This is, "Narco", swag, call me, Freshco-bar 
Leave me some head, she need a plu-u-u-ug
Fuckin' me good, she need a plu-u-u-ug
Holdin' me down, she be the plu-u-u-ug
Whatever I need, she be the plu-u-u-ug
Alright there ah buddy license and registration
Uh officer is there a problem man whats going on?
Yeah, I had a report of a UFO
whats that?
An unidentified Ferrari looking object flying by me on the highway
you know how fast you were going?
nah not at all man
you must have been going pretty fast because my radar is over there smoking buddy
keep your hands where I can fucking see 'em too
I heard about you in the paper, I know you got the toaster strudel mumbles
yeah I need some backup over here I've got two rap singers
I wonder briefly
Could it be there's no roof above me
or the 22's underneath me
Thats keepin them sirens flashin on my ass
Should I get to pumpin the brakes or mashin on the gas?
I'm naturally harassed
And I feel like I'm getting punked but I don't see Ashton in the grass
Nor is there a camera stashed into the dash
It's a guy in a uniform and a passion that he has
For flashin wit his badge
And shining light in my face
Plus he keep his right hand right by his waist
The wrong move will get a gun right in my face
And they fighting for my life I'm fighting the case
And I ain't trying to be the story they twist in the press
Like: the young man resisted arrest
Then he started reaching for something that looks like a pistol I guess
So I pulled on a nigga I mean I pulled on the trigger figures
I go around the corner what do I see?
Po Po's followin me
Askin for my ID whos car I'm driving
Po Po's botherin me
Got me in a lineup, got my hands in cuffs
They don't wanna set me free
Trying to bring me down, when they come around
Po Po's fuckin with me
Awe shit the jakes are fucking with me again
They hate to see me rich, they'd rather see me stuck in the pen
Everytime they walk or pull up beside me
Flash lights in my face askin for my registration and ID
I don't know the reason for the harassment
And the questions they askin
Or the ice grills they get when I'm passin
Or maybe its my fault
Cause I be out all times at night
Doin shit I know I shouldn't plus I don't be ridin right
Smokin' lyeno stash box for me to put the skit
Two warrants, no license and I ain't got insurance yet
I keep a hammer close because foes wanna stick me up
But keep my movement swift because Po's wanna frisk me up
Since '94 I've been told on by 50 descriptions
And in 10 years not once did they get a conviction
These pigs shouldn't provoke a rider
I'm so tired, they got one more time to fuck wit me before I open fire
ones for the money and twos for the show
three must be for the motherfuckin po po'
I've seen ghetto kings fall to the floor
cause they can't see ask
still some of y'all creepin with the Po Po's
Sleepin wit the Po Po's
Some of y'all walking wit the Po Po's
I ain't fuckin with the Po Po's
BITCH!
They gon' have to put my back on the cement
Before I'm in the back with my knee bent
On my way back to the precinct
I'm back in the G-bent
Black wit the pre-tint
Vanilla aroma to cover the back with the tree scent
The way I ride I know I'm in for a case
But the coupe do 200 so they in for a chase
When it comes to lawyers I got the man Puff uses
Thats why you never seen my wrists with handcuff bruises
I got them hollow tipsto stick up in the AR's
Detectors in the dashto pick up on the radar
Stash box in it when I purchased the vehicle
So I don't have a problem wit you searching the vehicle
They probably want to scoop an arrest
I try to throw shots but its cool, I got a coupe like a vest
And 'em troopers will just feel stupid I guess
The slugs will bounce off like they hittin superman's chestnigga
Fab: Shit man a nigga ain't even do shit awe shit here comes this dude right now
Cop: Alright buddy unfortunately you came back straight, you and your buddy
Scain Scholar get the fuck outta here I don't wanna see you guys around here again alright

When you work for me, it come with vacation 
Trip to LA just to hit crustaceans

Too busy doin' me to be mad at what you do

I'm just speaking for myself
And the real niggaz like me
If you ain't with a real nigga, then who are you with?
How you ride doesn't matter what kind of car you get?
I love my real bitches, fuck the fake hoes
I be asking God why he even make those?
Real real real re really tho
Me and my niggaz talkin' shit at the pool table
Wanna know who sat these nerds at the cool table?
Who let these unimportant hoes in the VIP?
Who let these little niggaz in? I need to see ID
Real real real re really tho
These lames never paid attention so they really owe
I know some R&B bitches that can really blow
Turkey burgers and hot chocolate, really ho?
When shit get real now then it's "I'm just playin'"
When people hating now then it's "I'm just sayin'"
Fake this and fake that got you feeling yourself?
You can't be real with me, you ain't even real with yourself
Me and some fly girls chillin' where the bar is
Wanna know when y'all gon' stop treasuring garbage?
When they gon' get they own and stop minding our biz?
When these Bride of Chucky Dolls became Barbies?
Real re re re I'm really certain
If everybody a boss, then who's really workin'?
If they say they got that raw shit, that really mean
Them white squares is stepped on, Billie Jean
Rather a real enemy than a fake friend
Rather know for sure, than be mistaken
One thing you should know, when you play the game
Lies always change, the truth stay the same
Tryin to show you somethin shorty
Ay baby girl they say the world is a beautiful place, that's right
I'm tryin to help you open yo' eyes and see that
Ha ha, this some shit, cool shit, real playa like
Hey shorty, we can do it real playa like
We can go a few places that you say you like
See what a day is like when you be my a-alike
Girl just lay back, I'll do it the way you like
Said it's the flyest thing, just the way we swing
Me and you, how we do, be so flyyyy
You need to leave them burgers alone and make a steak upgrade
I'm filet mignon with a tape-up fade
I see things clear through these Mark Jacob shades
Like the clarity in these jewels that Jacob made
You sleep better knowin you gon' wake up paid
Hairstyle, nails filed, makeup made
We can shock South Beach, shake up Dade
In a droptop Phantom with the Drakov blades
I'ma stop by the barber, you can hit the shops in the harbor
Then get the chops or the lobster
Prime on 12, dinner for dos
We, begin with a toast, end with a dose
of the light green cheeba, rolled in a Cohiba
It's Sunday, so you know the Forge is
Weather gorgeous, not a cloud in the sky
We can show the world how to be fly, yessss
If you want to act Hollywood fine, but shorty let's do it
when we sittin on the hills like the Hollywood Sign
And every man lies, but not every man flies
privately to Van Nuys
Range on the runway, driver to pop doors
Straight to Barney's, somethin we need to stop for
She like, "It's earlywhat we gonna shop for?"
How 'bout green grass breakfast, top floor
Later on Fred C, or Max Fields
Real playa like dress, good black heels
No 'Hanas, we can do Katana's
You, me, and ooh-wee marijuana
Then slide through Hyde, might include Mood
Maybe go to Area, if it's in the area
The Friday's young, try things my way hon
Malibu ride, highway 1
Nothing is too much, everything you touch turns to gold
You make me better you make me better
I'm fly as I can be, but when you're with me
I can't help but notice, I'm more focused but you're the coldest
Girl you are so 
Ay shorty
Bring the Maybach, we got a long way to go
Just lay back, you had a long day, I know
And they whack, do it the wrong way, I know
I play back but have the song playin low
Whilewe six-deuce and let you fix Goose
In a glass with some ice, maybe mix some juice in
On the way to L I , well I, coulda took the hell-eye
but we do more behind wheel
Hampton home, two floors for nine mill'
Real playa like two doors from Seinfeld
White marble, new floors that shine still
And the help keep food stored, wine chilled
Hey, you gotta live one day right right
Well how 'bout from Friday to Sunday night?
Then back 'fore they notice back up in Lotus
Let the world know we back and we focused!
On them streets
You better keep your hand on them heats
And live what you sayin' on them beats
Real talk
They ain't walkin' the walk, they just talkin' the talk
Some people look at me as the real talk of New York
I ain't these like these niggaz who be feinin' to front
Like they the first to ever put green in a blunt
Look I don't be meaning to stunt, but I zip down like jeans in the front
In somethin' that you seen and you want
But otherwise I'm cool wit' it
They say only the ones who never had gon' get and act a fool wit' it
Everybodys' gangsta through the promotion
Even if they raised in a house wit' a view of the ocean
The bangers is growin' upset
Cuz' ya' ass is on t v  throwin' up sets
And you know you ain't like that
But you'll say that you is
Go and rent a bunch a shit and and then say that its his
You ain't a pimp or you wouldn't go to dinner wit' groupies
Ain't a baller cuz' you wouldn't put spinners on hoopties
1-2-3  you don't really wanna fuck wit me
Get in the way you could get yourself shot
Fuck the cops, you on my block
Fuckin' wit a gangsta nigga
How can niggaz say they be on the other side of the seas'
Where the steering wheels are on the other side of the v's
And the home look like the spot on the other side of the c's
When they ain't never been on the other side of the p's
I ca' see through em', ya tents are too light
Every sentence you write is far from the truth
You wanna be that nigga you are in the booth
But you ain't got the heart, the scars, or the proof
And now you flash ya' shirt tag in our grill
But I'm hearin' you was a dirtbag before the deal
You walk around talkin' how every dime sucked
When they don't even speak to you, nevermind fucked you
Ya' hood sayin' don't come back
Step foot in here, and they gon' put you where you won't come back
Dog, how the fuck you gon' have keys in ya' house
When ya' moms' won't even give you keys to the house loser
Nigga you in the mirror, checkin' what your make ups' lookin' like
Tryina fool the world wit' a Jacob look-a-like
Jiving like you hold stacks
But ya' car is ten years old homie, ya' drivin' in a throwback
They gon' strip you, have you runnin' naked next
Without security you like unprotected sex
You ain't never gon' finger a trigger
All you do is look in the mugshot book and finger a nigga
I real recognize real, you'd be a john doe
You livin' in a closet and call it a condo
I don't member you as a slinger that was on the bench
Just a little scrub ass ringer in the tournaments
Now they try to blame the fall of hip hop on fans
Nah, I think its these hip hop con mans
Studio gangstas is played out now
This ain't the eighties, battle raps'll get you layed out
Fucka
1-2-3  and any time that you on them streets
You better keep your hand on them heats
And live what you sayin' on them beats
Real talk
Real talk
It's really really really really real talk
Uh, you think I give a fuck about what these niggas say man
They even talked about Jesus
I ain't mad at when it rain, cause I know the sun is somewhere shinin
Sorta like some clear diamonds
I hardly see my moms, but she know her son is somewhere grindin
Some where rhymin, or somewhere climbing
Out of a pottable 760, inclasable very sticky
Wit a handgun, to send these cowards to Heaven quickly
I ain't pussy, so I won't allow you to ever dick me
I know these greaseballs, wonder how could they ever stick me
But I move, like the President through town
Wit stones the size of earrings, in my Presidential crown
I put hollows from the Desert into clowns, cause the cemetary
Is where most of the dudes, that are hesitant are found
So I take the time, of whatever the bench throw
The 4BM put down, in a seventy-two inch hole
Mean while getting adapted, to the fame has be hectic
But I'm fucking like I'm tryna take down Chamberlain's record
And the girls more than like you, when you running run
Doing world tours like Michael, but girl's sure don't like you
You going on like thirty-six, flowin on some berry mix
The little money you get, you blowing on them dirty chicks
Tryna look young, so you throwing on the jersey quick
I'm on my second V-12, you going on ya thirty-six
You can look at this rider, and see I'm on the come-up
Cause I pass the hitch-hikers, like I don't see 'em with they thumb up
I just turn the system up and keep boppin
I never get, where I'm tryna go, if a nigga keep stoppin
And I tell the cops, this joint is for protection
Don't they see when I come through, how these people point in my direction
That's why I poke out my jeans, like my joint with a erection
Till I'm in a joint made for correction
And right now, the way rapper bi'ness spread
It wouldn't even surprise me, if one of these rappers is a Fed, nigga
Since I'm in the position to get rich, I'ma get it
Whether it come from rapping on blocks, flipping and pitching
And fuck the stove, and the kitchen where I cook and prepare it
Nigga you know and don't try to act like the truth ain't apparent
I'm on a mission to get richer, it's as simple as that
I make it obvious, when I pick up a pencil and rap
Like a  40 Cal, spittin on instrumentals I clap!
And these verses, are like the hollow point I sent through yo back
I get you murdered if I think you a wrap
Cause if you don't show loyalty, then that show me where ya principles at
And you don't know how much I been through, in fact
I never did like you, I ain't even gon' pretend wit you cats
And I'm the nicest, I ain't gotta say it twice and repeat it
I'm a lyrical genius, I never been beated, defeated
I'ma draw my weapon and squeeze it, you better believe it
Leave you parapaligic, I demand respect and I mean it
My Desert's the meanest, you probably dead if you seen it
Or spored out somewhere sick, you get red on the cement
And I blow off ya head for no reason, and just when I'm leavin
You don't know me ya on me homie, but the spread make us even, BLOAW!
And the bad part about it is man, haha
I'm only twenty years old man
And I'm just havin fun
Man I ain't even tryin man
Desert Storm's youngest, and in charge man
Paul Cain, man
Yo Fab man, you ain't even gotta go hard man
I got these niggas man
Clue! Holla at cha boy
Skatin Dolla
Duro! it's our year man
Desert Storm, we gon' kill niggas man
You already know what it is
It's a ho'cide man
Stop "Street Dreamin"
Yea, I ain't scared of you motherfuckers
I ain't no killer right
But y'all niggaz gon' make me one
For realleave me alone, shit
You fuckin with the wrong one brotha
I'm telling ya
I'm sittin in the crib dreamin 'bout killin ya
with machine guns shotties, desert Eag' dillingers
putting a bullet as big as a battery through a niggas anatomy
and watchin him die slow
you need full clips to push up in the joint
when you in the kinda truck that I push up to the joint
cuz theses motherfuckas will push him to the point
that you'll end up locked down doin push ups in the joint
but they'll box you in the corner
and you can throw ya fists up and act like you a boxer on his corner
ride wit ya gun in your glove box instead of on ya
you'll be six feet deep in one of them boxes if you wanna
not me, I squeeze the clips drop from the handle
till your remains is in a urn on top of the mantle
till everybody scramble off the block like they Randall run
till there's a mural on your block and some candles
who wanna die?
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin punk
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin chump
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin clown
cuz I'ma have to kill someone just to get some respeck
my teflons will have you screamin like Wyclef Jean 
someone please call 9-1-1
but if they ever get the watch on my left arm
ima have Marbury more buried than that guy Stephon
first, they put that white sheet over you brother
then the newspapers put you all over the cover
then you in a suit one hand cross over the other
last you in the earth with the dirt over you brother
a tinted hearse is what most men leave in
followed by a limo full of family and close friends greavin
one pull of marijuana
ima wanna kill you as bad as The Terminator wanted Sarah Connor
but, I'm loosin my patience
fuck it, send me to the island I could use a vacation
now it's easy for me to understand
how you could just kill a man
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin punk
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin chump
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin clown
cuz I'ma have to kill someone just to get some respeck
I'd rather be, 
judged by twelve than carried by the six
My gun ain't on my man or carried by my chicks
My gun ain't in my crib or carried in the six
If I'm right here nigga then its right here nigga
Picture me put in my hearse
like I ain't gotta clip full of hollow tips to put in these jerks
I might as well put in the work
Spit 'em up outta here then get 'em up outta here
I got the juice, like bishop had wit him
That just don't give a fuck, semi
Like ol' dog had wit him
I'm sayin prayers for my enemy
I hope god bless him, before the fucker run into me
I dunno what the fuck has got into me
But I know I don't want them slugs goin into me
I'm just tryin to live my life

Get that money yup! Dolla dolla bill y'all, yup!
Get that money yup! Dolla dolla bill, yup yup!
Yesssit's the return of the young hustle
A nigga came for the money, not the tongue tussle
Me I'd rather do my lip lashin, when the chips cash in
Then you might see me on the strip flashin
like Vegas lights, and they say I shine Vegas bright
Draw a crowd like a Vegas fight
So shiiiiiiit, gettin hit in my leg is like
I mean it coulda been a 2Pac vegas night
Or maybe a Notorious L A  evening
"Baby you okay?" I mean well I'm breathin
Hell I'm even, bossin and I left
The money ain't right then I toss you to the left
Yesss, to the left, to the left
Everything is hustle to the death for the F-
-A-B baby, they be lazy
Gucci straightjacket cause I may be crazy
Loony for the loot, psycho for the paper
This a new year but I recycle for the paper
If green talks, then I'm the Geico with the paper
So have my check right, no typos with the paper please
They say the rap game remind 'em of the crack game
That's why they money go, quicker than a crack high
My money stack high, how high? Shaq high
Yao high, that's why, yours is Bow Wow high
You lookin at your new hustle, like your last hustle
Was looked at as Russell, in my past hustle
Shorty work it, she be on her ass hustle
She make it clap, she know how to work them ass muscles
Fast rush you, then back to the money
They say I'm frontin, can't turn my back to the money
And truthfully you're cool but I'm attracted to money
So why don'tcha turn your back to the money and let it shake
I'm lovin how you move that smooth, you let it snake
But players don't chase at it baby we let it make
Bet it make sense when you make them dollars
I ain't gotta make them move, but I make them holla
This my year, but y'all can help me celebrate
I'm 9:15, that means I'm hella straight
Swizz stacks, Just Blaze bucks
I'm back for my money, it's just they luck
Get your money in the air, m-m-money in the air

Nigga you don't need that dough 
We trin' to kill these niggas
Run'em down nigga
Load the 4-4 up

Jump outta of the Lambo, And the doors go up
Hit you and your ho up, from the torso up
Leave y'all there 'til the coroner or the law show up 
Im that nigga they say preforming so the whores show up
Why cop? I rob you, ice your Rol' up
I pop bottles, ain't no need for no cup
Roll the pure 'dro up, stroll the floor to' up
The difference between Fab and y'all, after I pick an auto up
Every month I ain't gotta give more doe up
Fuckin' with this you'll buy a washer when the shore slow up
I have it when ya kids see-saw go up, a C4 will blow up
Check these diamonds, no flaws show up
My niggas clap up parties, shoot tour shows up
What ya'll know bout head til a chicks jaw swoll up
Goin' gold minutes after the gates on stores go up
You know who done it now, Few hundred miles
And with shoes on it now
It's like a few hundred thou
When we run up this guns 2 stomach style
Got to flaunt it now
Nigga who want it blawgh

Yo, You must wanna die
From the nigga you testify against
Fabolous make bail before they identify the prints
Swing by a vince, In a buggy eye with tents
Sittin on nineteen's, Gun stash by the vents
Niggas is lookin at the chain cause they eyes squint
I pull up, Pull out, Pull back
Them guys will sprint
Last nigga that talked slick and been replyin' since
Got a deal, No sellin', Been supplyin since
Leave niggas on the ground like tire prints
We done make ya eyes look bent, Just by the sense
These niggas dont believe, Then they gone die convinced
Once I present the four fifth why comment
Im the type you tell ya dame bout
Push a fellow brain out
Leave'em in front of the spot that they sell cocaine out
One single, Had to tint the yellow Range out
Everybody runnin' up tryin' to spell the name out F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S
Ride for this
Where my niggas at get high to this
Where ya'll at
Die for this
Throw guns up to the sky for this
Where ya'll at
Ride for this
Where my niggas at get high to this
Where ya'll at
This is why they fuck with me: right after the head
I tell em I gotta leave cause I'm trying to stay sucker-free
They say I'm a dog, well that makes them a fucking flea
And now I understand why their ass is so stuck on me
Luckily, I be feeling good in my bucket seats
Thug Motivation: myw shit
Fit for two clips
The kid is a nuisance
Awww man, he a D
I'm a reach my goal and you ain't gon take this puck from me
Coco Loso in my Stanley Cup
You could say whatever, just don't bring the family up
Who could fuck with me? Everybody hand be up
But when we set the date, bet these niggas stand me up
I'm down to earth like gravity, but man we up
Women get around me and they cannot keep their panties up
Your boy drop jewels, you niggas should ante up
This is food for thought, you bitches fill the pantry up
As I get older, I be looking at what rap breeds:
A bunch of tatted up niggas who can rap weed
And I ain't saying I'm exactly what rap needs
I'm just a swagged-out nigga in a Rapide
With a 3-year old, that I'm trying to be here for
Road to the riches, and my gift is my vehicle
And I ain't even talking about that Aston Martin
Even though I bought that for my birthday
The lines I come up, they pass the margin
Yeah, I write my best shit on my worst day
And that's the shit that gets you richer
Turn a negative into a positive: get the picture?
People say I changed  it's not me, it's the money
It's the middle of the winter but they got me where it's sunny
And I'm not just being funny, I know no other way
Let's just finish up this Riesling and roll another J
Uh, c'mon, uh, c'mon
Uh, William H  Bonnie, ma' I make you famous
Some little pretty mami's is all I need 
Hennessy, Cristal and sticky weed 
A little drop sports coupe's all I want 
And I brought the hammer if y'all front woooh
Yeah, the kid been makin these mami's, yell "papacita"
Since Kangols and shell-top Adidas
Love when te-ta's look like they'll pop through beaters
And the hips won't fit in the L-drop two-seater
But ma' I ain't the type to love ya
I'm a triflin, good for nothin, type a brother
This cute face'll make your wife smile
And I check in two bags and one's just a suitcase full of Lifestyles
And we both rent out playa
Difference is you a sweet subsitute, I'm a Penthouse playa
Y'all seen my rings borders
It's full of queen and king's daughters, as clean as spring water
'F's for freakin, 'A's alright 
'B's for bottles that pop all night 
'O's for the ounces that I got say what
That we blow everday, know why, why not, nigga?
Right now you probably like me, but
Later on you gonna love me and
Right now you probably want me, but
Later on you gonna need me and 
Right now you don't like me, but
Later on you gonna hate me
And I just got to do it
Fuck y'all, I'm a keep doin my thing
It's the hoodrat Hugh Hefner, that bend dimes, too
The five plus one, sittin on ten times two
Shorty when I'm through
I'm a know if you nice on the mic and if your friend rhyme, too
It's so funny how I suit the women
They know I'm still spendin show money from "Superwoman"
They like "where'd he get those twenties?"
And "I didn't know that's a color that the coupe could come in,it man"
All I say to the heffers is "Jesus"
Keep swallowin my kids, might as well have no nephews and nieces
I know you wanna sip Proof
And try an make me crack a smile, just so you can see my chipped tooth
I'm tryna' get you, in and out of my room
Just to get, in and out of your womb
And the rocks in mine glare, somethin like Times Square
Excuse me miss, you want me to sign where? sign where?
Fab's hard to be found
But most likely I'm with a foreign dame who name's hard to pronounce
I started out, gettin hard by the ounce
No more cash in stashes, it's cards in accounts
The way I make 'em nod to the bounce
Somebody call Silvia and tell her ship larger amounts
This playa make 'em scream a scheme
My closest look like I keep gettin traded from team to team
Look sleezy, it's difficult
but me and Tim the only ones that make pimpin look easy
Tell me how I'm gonna make my album cleaner
With bitches suckin me up like vacuum cleaners
Even chickens wanna cluck outside
Yo' Fab, it must be the truck outside
And mami can't stop eyein
And when I said my rims was only nineteens, she said "stop lyin!"
Say what, say what, uh huh
You don't need us, huh?
I see you comin back to her
Like that, with the two-step
Fabolous, we out
Yeah man, Real Talk New York
Yeah man, Street F-F-F-Fitted, Damn
Yeah man
And they say what comes around goes around
So the cristal rolls ya down til it slows ya down
I got a smoother style
Fo me it's  Slow Motion  like Juvenile
'Til I pass through ya areas
The SLR, class lookin' serious, they has to be curious
You never seen one of the nastiest lyricist
Speed through like he in the  Fast and the Furious 
Like Pharrell, we stand on bars
Girls on us like a fan on stars
500 Grand on cars, you'll see a man on Mars
Before a nigga lay a hand on ours
Catch me in a Diamond chain and a thick cuban
In the piece lookin' somethin' like Rick Rubin
Put a grin on ya face, then spin in ya waist
The world look like it's spinnin' in space
Whoa, whoa, slow down mami
Uh uh, ya betta keep up daddy
I show ya how to get ya roll on all ya gotta do is hold on
and it goes
What comes around goes back around again
And niggaz gon' act up now again
And What goes up must come down
And I'll be here like What's Up now?
I do the yankee rockin' wit a lean
Know ya can't knock it when ya clean
Girls want me on they ass like back pockets on the jeans
I just try to plug into the socket in between
Then watch me do my step
At the same time throwin' up who I rep
Street F-F-F-F-Fitted
No other way to put it to ya ma'am
But the look'll say D-D-D-D-Damn
I can throw down like a killa
Put slugs and banana clips that'll slow down gorillas, Girl
Move like you in a Hula Hoop
Then blow me like you tryin' to cool ya soup, I'm Hot
Whoa, whoa, slow down mami
Uh uh, ya betta keep up daddy
I show ya how to get ya roll on all ya gotta do is hold on
and it goes
I'm lookin' for a 10 cent wifey
Cool as a 10 cent icey
That'll fit in vince nicely
Let 'em get close
Tell 'em play dimmy
Imma get swazy, you can get ghost
Well, F-A-Beezy, F-A-Sheezy
To the press suite at the F-O-Ceezy
I'm lookin' at you Yeah, man
You lookin' at me Yeah, man
Slow down ma, ya speedin' again
You can put the top down and blow weed in the wind
But fo now, let yo hips go to this
Betta yet, let ya lips blow a kiss
When I dip low and flip, show the wrist
It looks like a froze hypno and cris
And I'm in amazing shape
With the DR flag on a bathe of apes
Whoa, whoa, slow down mami
Uh uh, ya betta keep up daddy
I show ya how to get ya roll on all ya gotta do is hold on
and it goes
Yeah, you know the crazy thing is 
They gon' talk about you when you ain't got shit
but then they gon' talk about you when you got shit
And see they gon' talk even when they don't know
what you had to do or what you go through
Sacrifices 
Seeing your family scramblin', that's sanity damagin'
Gotta, make a move can't just stand and be mannequin
Have a man who be managin', randomly standing in places he shouldn't
Tryin' to move that Pamela Anderson under-
stand and beat hammers and grandma keep panelin'
Cause them niggas from the other side are fans of me vanishin'
New day, new funeral, my grandma be panickin'
But I gotta eat, she just handin' me sandwiches
And an appetite like mine, got me scammin' and scandelin'
Ridin' shotty with my homie, but I plan to be phantom and
bumping something I can feel, fam, I need samplin'
Not no Bieber on the hook, I need Anthony Hamilton
I got molly, I got white, I be  Hannah Montana  and
like a  Migo  it's illegal, but it's grands in my hand again
So it probably ain't right, but this the land of the scandalous
'Til your own friend a snake you probably can't understand it then
When you go you're just gone, all we missing is payments
Dr  King fought for my freedom that I risked just to pay rent
Ain't no love for these streets, ain't no kissin' the pavement
Yeah, I'm sick and tired of shit, but they insist on being patient
But for what? To wait on that eviction note?
I wake up to some real shit, them dreams I have is fictional
Unless I go and get it, don't stop, get it, get it
2 Live Crew money and the Luke dancers with it
Jesus died on that cross, that's a sacrifice
Niggas dyin' for their cross, that's a sacrifice
Rosa Parks took a charge, that's a sacrifice
If shorty took that charge for you, that's a sacrifice
Just do what you gotta do, baby
You gotta do what you gotta do, baby
Baby gotta do what a baby gotta do
Baby mama ain't got it, but her baby father do
Never pick up baby boy, but his Mercedes powder blue
Now mommy sick of daddy and baby got a flu
And what's crazy about it too, is all she sees is lies 
when she look him in his eyes  and her baby got them too
Pay a little child support, but what's so shady about him too
is in the club he pop Rozay, but won't bring baby bottles through
I know things fell 'part, I ain't saying we gotta blew
But if you walkin' around in Prada, buy your baby Prada too
Tellin' hoes ''yes'', we can't get a ''maybe'' outta you
Shit is fucked up, and I don't think the baby gotta poo
What's a lady gotta do? Bend over for dollar tips?
Cause ain't nobody givin' young, single mothers scholarships
Mama just got diagnosed, breast cancer
So when they ask what she's gonna do, her best answer
is ''I don't know, gotta do what I gotta do'
And I don't know about your bills, but the ones I got are due"
People always wanna try and tell you what you gotta do
But there's a difference in what those who don't and those who gotta do
It's called sacrifices, hate to see my man gone
Bail was like a pop fly just to bring my man home
Can't just leave him out there
Gotta believe in yourself even when there's doubt there, yeah
"Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby you're the best"
Nothing more stressful than buryin' your best bull 
Feelin' empty make you keep that Smith & Wes' full 
I realized that it's more snakes and less wolves
So me and my trey pound like KD and Westbrook 
We just tryna get up out that cesspool 
We just tryna eat, not up in no mess hall 
My old head that used to rob dropped the best jewels 
He said "Your failure's gonna teach you to be successful" 
I'm rocking carrots/karats but I never ate my vegetables 
I'm playin' festivals, I used to play the vestibules 
Stuntin' every day, my schedule was flexible 
VIP sectionals, grabbin' on my testicles 
Got an extra full clip for that extra bullshit
Nigga you gotta give us some answers, you're doin' questionable shit 
Your old lady showed me  Good Times  on some Esther Rolle shit 
We live in a cold world, I'm on my eskimo shit
It's sad 
"Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
Baby you're the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness, ohh"
I was born in the summer 
Malik died in the summer 
It get live in the summer 
Head to Brooklyn, I'm knockin' this Bobby Shmurda in my G-Stars
Free my GS9 niggas, throw Rowdy on and breeze off 
Since a rookie shootin' like Ray Allen in that 3-4
when he was a Milwaukee Buck, not whisperin', I'm talkin' up
Look, I can't be worried about ISIS, my life is triflin'
Affordin' dollar slices, just prayin' they don't indight us 
Keepin' both my fists raised up, I'm like the fightin' Irish
Had molly sales at Notre Dame when ain't nobody know my name 
Remember givin' caine out, remember all the misses givin' brain out 
Remember when Fab was spellin' his name out 
Before I bought the foreigns, took the train route 
When Cam had that pink Range out, it was Reggie, wasn't no paint out
Vegas nights, sky dweller Rollie look like a Vegas light 
Was tryna pitch an eighth of white just to go eat some steak and rice 
I know you hate this life, jeweler actin' nervous tryna break the ice
Nothing scares me anymore 
I love Red Bottoms but really hate the spikes
It's sad
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby you're the best
I got my red dress on tonight

So, I'm with dark-skinned Lorraine
Parked in the Range, sparks in my chains

Cause they busy minding mine instead of minding theirs

Got some Ciroc, you know what kind it is
She said, "It's yours babe, let's see how mine it is"
Let me test that head out, I wouldn't mind a quiz

"You hate me? Keep on sayin that shit girl!"
"Yeah, that's right, I hate yo ass! You make, me, sick! I can't STAND yo black ass!
You act like a little boy instead of a grown ass man! I HATE YOU!!"
"We'll you know what? I hate yo ass tooDO somethin'!"
"Gimme the keys to my car, Jody, you ain't goin nowhere!"
"Get up off me girl! See there you go again, BRINGIN' yo ass downstairs
SHOWIN' off in front of these FUCKIN' neighbors! GET YO ASS BACK UPSTAIRS!!!"
"FUCK YOU AND THESE NEIGHBORSI HATE YOU!!"
"I HATE YOU ASS TOO!"
"I LOVE YOU!! I love you so much, Jody!"
"I love you too, baby!"
 We all have situationships
 Good sex, bad relationships
Had dinner dates, had vacation trips
Now the respect is lost, the admiration dips
 And all we do is fuckin' argue
 Yeah, that's it: fuck and argue
Why have somebody lyin' wit' me every night
if they just gon' be lyin' to me every night?
I'm tryin' but I'm never right, buyin' shit you never liked
Two wrongs just make us wrong, why even be together right?
We used to be lovers, now we used to each other
Keep accusin' each other of us using the other
And what's crazy is soon as you fall back, they crawl back
Sayin' they sorry and want it all back
How do I get myself in these situations
Good thing I know 
Yeahsomebody gon' be mad if they hear me saying that I'm singleeee
Cause lately I been feeling like, I'm singleeee
How does together feel so alone
Like I'm a stranger in my own home
Like I'm singleeee guess I'm singleeee singleeee, I'm singleeee
Titles ain't shit, if the story don't match it
Now you got a itch lookin' for a away to scratch it
Flirting online hopin' shorty don't catch it
In the strip club, you do it for the ratchets
Meanwhile discussin' turn into fussin'
Name callin' and cussin'  the person you put your trust in
You tryna take back something you already said
That's like giving CPR to something already dead
And it is what it is or it is what it isn't
The comfort to us, is no longer sufficient
But I hit it well and in public I didn't yell
We got everybody fooled, but I think the kids could tell
That the situation ain't the best it ain't the worst
It's been times that I felt like this, it ain't my first
That alone got me like try harder, or why bother
One thing I know 
"If you believe all that mucho frontin crap you spat out on the radio today
you don't respect me or the relationship!"
"Gina, how can you say that? You know I respect you "
"Then you go out there and you tell your friends what's real!"
Wait a minute dammit! What's real between me and you ain't none of their business!"
So what you're sayin' is that you respect in private but not in public?
"Gina " "Fine! It's over, Martin!"
"whoa whoa! You, you makin' me laugh!
You're gonna break up with me because of what I do on the radio?"
"No, because of what you do to me on the radio!"
"DAMMIT GINA! Now I'm mad! You don't get it, do ya? This is childish, Gina! 
That's how you wanna leave me right? I'm a man, Gina! I'mma be alright! 
This is childish! I want you out! I don't even know why you still here!
Step! I wan- STEP! GINA GINA GINA!
You won! You won, babe!"
"I what?" "You wonDAMN!!"
I wanna be your number 1 fan, but from the stage
Know it's hard to see way up in the stands
I understand, but 
Wishing I could be that one man, but you juggle
Way too many of them with one hand
I understand, but 
Yea, Slow down baby, let me be your yellow light
The way we met was wrong, let me say hello right
You need a mellow night, a break from this ghetto life
The way I roll make them haters wanna yellow dice
She say what matters is that you keep them stilettos nice
And when you slap this ass, it shake like Jello, right?
Well alright, roll them cigarellos tight
I nicknamed her bape chicken and yellow rice
Pretty brown skin, long blonde hair
And she know they talking but she never gon' care
Cause when you balling trash-talk is what you gon' hear
I can't imagine what a fall upon LeBron's ear
Always been the girl that didn't have to wait in line
Niggas buy her watches just for making time
Fake say "give it up" never had to ask
They call her the stick up girl that never wore a mask
Baby, ain't you tired of life in this fast lane?
Packing luggage, rushing, trying to catch that last plane?
There's some dudes who take pride in trying to gas dames
The same dudes will see her and give they last name
Funny how I became the apple of her eye
The game went South and I'm a rapper from NY
Don't get me wrong: lil mama love "Trap or Die"
But through it all she kept her watch on the dapper guy
And fell in love with a 2009 verse
She said before we met, I fucked her in her mind first
We crossed paths, a mixture of karma and luck
I walked in strong, mentally palming my nuts
I got em swarming and stuck, she calm in the cut
You know me? I can spot a Swan from a Duck
My approach? Smoother than an Armani tux
The diamonds going off, like the alarm on a truck
The small talk, warming her up, she palming her cup
She told me that I make her laugh and I'm charming as fuck
But for now she had to go, the chat just quickly changed
She was chilling, now she leaving, I mean that was kinda strange
Asked "can we meet again?" She said "that can be arranged"
And I'm sure we both have phone numbers that can be exchanged
We did, she slid, that'd a be explained
But for now she hopped into a Platinum-colored Range
See baby, see you gotta get ur mind right while there's still time left
You know life, wanting VIP sections and flight confirmations
Jumpin start to star, got ur own constellation
I aint tryna say dat u, shit, maybe I am
Never follow ur heart
Sure to lose your mind…if u neva follow ur heart
You need to Slow down…Yes baby u need to slow down 
You need to Slow… You need to Slow… You need to Slow Down
Baby for real You need to Slow it on…Slow it on Down
Best things come to those who wait
It's time to go get it
I said I'm so New York, Weezy probably don't like me
La-dada-da-da-da-daaaa
For my city, emphasis on my city
You got to go to L A  if your looking for Diddy
You gotta check C T  if your looking for Fitty
Niggas in Paris, but what about the city?
I'm so N Y  like the folks who make Playstation
Hope ya'll enjoyed your summer vacation
I been on that medicine, all y'all sick patients
Time to come for Sugar Hill, word to Ray Nathan
I'm coming for the belt and I stay H'ing
Coming for your Idol, word to Clay Aiken
Pause- in case they take it the wrong way
And bitch nigga always take it the wrong way
Still spitting, I'm the city's saliva
Want the keys to it like the designated driver
Sometimes I listen to my old rhymes, it feels like I had the fucking keys the whole time
Ain't gotta give me credit, I take cash
Broooklyn Yeah we take cash
Those old niggas trying to live off their old bodies
These young niggas think they killing shit, with no bodies
But this ain't about old school, new school
Cause my old school look better than your new school
And I drive my new school like my old school
Just to wave at the teachers from my old school
In Flex We Trust I let him do my old schools
The girl used to brain me, you love my old school
Stop playing, you boys grew up on me
I fed you, burped you, until you threw up on it
I gave these niggas style, they never had a Clue
But they heard the freestyles yea they had the Clues
Been doing this a while, probably had your boo
She probably came back had a little attitude
Gun charge, oh yea I had like two
My black lawyer beat them, never had a Jew
I done had a few, never use, had them new
So I'm Pac, in a white suit, I Ain't Mad At You
No Diddy, no Dupri, no Dr  Dre
No Cash Money from Baby, and no Rocs from Jay
And I'm still here, I'm still here!
I'm so New York that I'm still her
I'm way too different to treat the same 
You still playin', I already beat the game 
I'm not with the break up, the make up shit
I'm on some wake up and cake up shit
So, no apologies, just a pile of G's 
Make stacks for my niggas, all my pals are G's
Tryna to kick it, I don't like your soccer 
Curve a chick like a lipo doctor, hah!
I used to think about how you would act when a nigga got money
Now you done switched up on me
Now you wanna say what's up to me
Okay so now you wanna make love to me 
Girl if you don't get the fuck from me
I know you thought we had somethin' special
But you don't mean nothin' to me
Girl I'm sorry you not the one for me 
Just be honest girl, what you want from me?
This ain't nothin' new, keep it so 100
I can't let none of these niggas get one up on me
I go by God Tiller, you better run from me 
Give hope to my niggas, them niggas love money
Adios to them bitches, can't get a hug from me
I'm high on life, that's what it does for me
My numbers goin' up, I feel a buzz comin' one up 
Young nigga, young nigga
Your friends bad too then tell 'em come with ya
And we like, bitches with they own shit
We don't like gold diggers 
This the shit I don't condone and
Cheatin' on your man but you can get it if you want it 
Lookin' for a bad bitch, I finally found a culprit
Nigga takin' shots and I'm back, check the postage, yeah
Hatin' ass nigga, why won't you shut up?
This the motherfuckin' 502 come up 
And every time I'm back in the city
Every bitch with a hidden agenda run up cause I'm on nigga 
You could've been and you would've been
You get it now but you never understood it then 
News bulletin, yup, all our bullets tins
I'ma pull a Benz up, pocket full of bands 
What's up, with them get back texts?
Yes we wasn't workin' out, time to get back flexin'
Same phone, "Who's this?" Yeah I switched up on you 
What happened to old boy, oh he bitched up on you?
Now she want to ride stick, tryna witch up on you
When I do want to cut, I hit Rich up on you
He came through with Tiller, I'm posted with killer
Hit Relly like I'm with the young nigga young nigga
And now it's T R A P S O U L with the boy who rap S O U L
Tapes in the winter like it's Thanksgiving dinner
Like it's Christmas spirit, got a gift with lyrics
You niggas stay far from me 'til your bitch get near it, huh
I'm ridin round and I'm gettin it
It's mine, I spend it
I'm ridin round and I'm gettin it
It's mine, I spend it
I'm smokin on exotic, she bitching about her stomach
When we have sex she felt it in the stomach
Throw that money up, she make that money vomit
And when I'm with the school bitch, money was the subject
I'm ridin round to my city, emphasis on my city
This bullsht ain't gon carry on
No none of that shit fly with me
Yeah I'm back with my guy with me
That boy named Trigga Trey
We ridin round we gettin it
Maybe I stay out them niggaz way
Just like the late Bigga say
More money, more problems
Matter fact I'd rather that to having no money be your problem
If hustle plus muscle equals success then it's no problem
Think I care if you fuck with me
No sir that's a ho problem
We be on the loud shit
Y'all be smoking that low volume
Over here is going down, over there ain't no slalom
I'm so fly I need a co-pilot
Need a ride but with low mileage
And all my girls be holding in the back, no wallet
I'm ridin round windows up
Young peace town can't wait to fuck
Another one in the back can relate to her
Got tittes big and they fake as fuck
My niggaz got em pistols I'll never catch no case bra
Life is like a strip club and I always got my paper up
Swears like a nigga can make enough
Fame for the kk beggin up
Stop it, watch it, pocket, scrap it
Niggaz know I got it
Knowledge where she drop after that I take her shopping
Bitch niggaz be talkin we just call it pussy poppin'
Trigga's home, where he go though? I been on what you ain't know ho
Snatch the doze up on that photo
Make that girl tattoo my logo
She go below the belt cha that's a low blow
Made her say ah and I ain't talkin coco loso
Understand me, you fuckin' with the family
You know who my man beniggas done started somethin'
Ungrateful, I see what the hate do 
Even though we made youniggas done started somethin'
If you try to play me 
You crazy, you crazyniggas done started somethin'
If you try to play me 
You crazy, you crazyniggas done started somethin'
You bit off more than you can chew, ain't much more that I could do 
than go look for you niggas, I got a warrant for your crew 
Y'all done got me started, put me in this position
Pushed my buttons, put the key in my ignition 
Nigga once the engine runnin', I'm comin' to injure somethin'
Fuck me like I'm sex, promise revenge is comin'
Sometimes, can't wait for karma to get 'em back 
And momma said "If they hit you, you better hit 'em back"
See, that's how I was raised, that's how I'm not phased
Cause I'm worth too much nigga, that's how I appraise 
I done cut off the frauds, disappeared enemies
I'm not a fan of phony vibes and weird energy
Even a friend of me, started hatin' on a G
It seem petty like Bruce spelling his Kaitlyn with a C 
Man I see it all, if he tazed me, it wouldn't shock me
Dawg I heard it all, if you Jay-Z, you couldn't rock/Roc me
Couldn't  Knock  me, so they had to go another route
White sheets over you, for helpin' undercovers out 
Like Thanksgiving day, slide through your mother house
We gon' pull them muffins out, blow a nigga stuffin out 
Shorty you know nothin' 'bout, finishin' games
This the flow that blemish yo name, deminish yo fame
Boy your whole style is trash, your image is lame
I'll set yo' ass on fire, then extinguish yo' flame woo!
From start to finish, I finish then I start again
Ran into yo broad again, I met her at the Party Inn
Fed her that Bacardi then, spread it like acordians 
Then she made it clap for me, better than the audience
She say you keep callin', tryna get her into arguments
How you was cool but now you sweater like a cardigan
Once you get a real nigga, get rid of the fraudulent
I can handle that baby, tell me where he at baby
I've got some things to say, oh please don't go
So don't you turn away, oh please don't go
I need you here to stay, I miss you so
My daddy left me and he ain't even die
So when he did go, I ain't even cry
I had reason but that ain't even why
How could he have failed, if he ain't even try?
I ask no questions, I ain't even pry
Truthfully I wanted to, I can't even lie
Like a canceled flight, that ain't even fly
To just walk away, like you ain't even my
Like, like, like, I ain't even your
I can't even say it, I ain't even sure
He should of gave me everything and left me even more
But he left me without saying what he was leavin for
And that's when I became a man became a man
And that's the day he stopped bein one bein one
This year I became a father father
And I'm a die bein one, what's up son?
I have nightmares of me not bein around
He took his first steps and daddy couldn't be in town shit
Daddy's entertaining everybody 
But missed out when it came to trainin for the potty
I give a fuck about hip-hop's new beef
I was more excited when my son grew teeth
So I seem the problem of the famous stardom
Just like Em and Hailie, just like Game and Harlem
Nah not his date, I'm talkin about his daughter his daughter
Now that's  Stuntin' Like Your Daddy 
'Cause it's crazy when you wanna be nothin like your daddy
And if you've never been a man been a man
That's the day you start bein one start bein one
This year I became a father father
And I'm a die bein one, what's up son?
So hear the truth remain to, let me go
I won't hold that against ya, I moved on
Just look what I've become since you've been gone
Now don't you turn away, oh, please don't go
Here's what I got to say, oh, please don't go
Oh why'd you go away, oh, please don't go
I needed you here to stay, oh, please don't go
I can't believe this pain, no, please don't go
Why did you leave me?
Tell me why you don't care
Daddy, tell me why did you leave me?
Why you don't care
Tell me why did you leave me?
Daddy, tell me why you weren't there
Why did you leave me?
It goes however I wanted to
These bitches never say can't
I just call it angel, she look like heaven in pants
Big house, couple rides
Call that shit Neverland Ranch
Tre Pounds, shoot fast, call that shit Kevin Durant
You niggas beneath me
Now go get fucking stomped son
No I run this city I am Brooklyn's Nucky Thompson
If they make me go in
I'ma go right away
My fly ass can't be stopped no flight delay
Gotta a crew of bad bitches
Call em the nice girls
Yo bitches look scary
But she ain't no spice girl
It's 9am when you clock, you're an office worker
It's big Bens in my pocket I'm a rothsberger
Coconut ciroc and pineapple, easy order
Now I got this chick showing me what Yeezy taught her Amber Rose?
Welcome to the funeral pay respect
Me and your girl, unibrow, may connect wait a sec
Let it breath 
Its goes getting more money
They come with more problems
I used to be Mac'ing but now I'm Steve Jobbin' man
See you got 2 choices
You can stay broke or grind
Life is a bitch, and I'm just tryna Oprah mine
Gettin' more money, it comes with more problems
Man used to be Mac'ing but now I'm Steve Jobbin'man
Got 2 choices
You can stay broke or grind
Life is a bitch, and I'm just tryna Oprah mine
Always been a squeezer, I've been on the hollow niggas
Always been a leader no twitter, I don't follow niggas
Fuck glass, drink Rose out the bottle nigga
I promised to keep it 1000 you know my motto nigga
Don't just talk it, be about it
You talk it, but we about it
We do it, you read about it
Leave 'em don't speak about it
We live it, you dream about it
How could you even doubt it
Couldn't get a quarter round here
Unless we allowed it
This is our city, our town, our turf
We eatin' and y'all thirst
Do shoot back, bomb first
Get 'em gone first
Let em fire, arms burst
Regardless of size or status
Stuff em in that long hearse
I think I'm Malcolm X, Huey Newton
Marcus Garvey, I'm surrounded by my army
Damn, nigga try and harm me
Fuck what a hater think
How could niggas try to rob me
If I'm out in Abu Dhabi, ferrari's and Maserati's
Fleets pulling up in Nobu's and Cipriani's
Or that F1 race track, good look tryna find me
Wherever I'm at ,I'm smoking some Bob Marley
7 star hotels, you can see the ocean from the lobby
Riding in the goose, riding to the Goose
Believe the great deal with stress
I've been through the most
Changed my whole way of thinking, got a new approach
Fly private if it ain't first class, I'm through with coach
Street fam for life, this we all owe the los
Whole gang bottles in the air
I propose a toast
We dun seen the World
Partied with emirates
We all come from nothing, always remember that
So you should be thankful everytime you spend a stack
For the all classy restaurants we ate dinners ate
All the cars, audemars with the different straps
But always strive for more, never be content with that
No beginner rap, no number 1 contender jack
Arnold Swarzenegger returns, Decembers back
Now I don't jerk off in public, but I been out-doin my self
Undisputed swag champ, that big H be my belt
Fresh pair of them Jordan 3's, all black G Vanci
That snapback with that snake skin, you niggaz gotta see Don C
Motherfucker we rollin, some brown skin girls, and some Beyonces
Ball like this, you gon see the kind of hate LeBron see
Pop a band, throw a bill up, them strippers call me Chauncey
Look so cool, in my leather jacket, they should be callin me Fonzi
But I ain't got my collar up, I just got my dollars up
Big fish see little fish, and you little niggaz get swallowed up
Shouldn't of been in this shark tank, ain't my fault if I eat them
Why would I wanna join them, when I always knew I could beat them
Keep a foot on they neck, fresh pair of them weak Timb's
Ain't no love in hip-hop, but still let you eat 'em
Came for the competition, but there wasn't much around
I let you kiss the ring but you'll never touch the crown
Swag champ I got the belt, swag champ I got the belt
When it's done come talk to me  you'll see I got the B
B is for them big boys with the grown money
And bad bitches who ain't got to spend they own money
Now I ain't come here to be playing, showtime expect me out
That hotel, that newest shit, ya I see em tryna check me out
That new chain just came in, guess what, my neck be out
Funny I be goin innn, everytime they let me out
Ran thru that Louis store, once I blow that, check me out
Threw me 2 tees, felt like they was tryin to take me out
No discrimination, I will still sweat your sexy out
Like them with that Keisha ass, but gotta have that Becky mouth
Rep my town but I'm hardly here, gotta go in when I party here
Drinks so strong, I can barely lift 'em  weed so loud, I could hardly hear
Love the way that track suit lay on those shell toes
Money talks, you ain't got it, convo, hell noo
Stick to bein you boy, stay on yo', Velcro
Hate to see yall been backwards, Rondo, elbow
Came for the competition but it wasn't much around
I let you kiss the ring, but you'll never touch the crown
Yeah, F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S
C'mon, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, yeah, yeah, c'mon
If I take you home, will you still be my thug baby
You gotta love the way this playa be minglin
If you don't tell yo man mama, I ain't sayin a thing and
That nigga got you used to the A-train on Kingston
I'm fuckin on Lambo's, lay on the wingfin
By the way I be blingin, the pay that I bring in
Mind spendin a day with the kingpin?
Answer yo cell, all day it been ringin
Tell that nigga, we on our way out to England
Them hips and tips, the way they be swingin
The way the be jinglin, letz stay til the spring and
Know I thugged you out, the way that you drinkin
And don't be scared carryin the yay I be slingin
Ma, I'm where you wanna be, if not
We can hop in a lid and fly where you wanna be
Yea, you a G, the type that ryde with them cameras
Instead of the rearviews on the V, I know
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be my thug baby
Because I need one tonight
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be my thug baby
Because I need one tonight
Allright, okay 
You just gotta stay patient boo
I'ma make sho to take you, where eva you dream a vacation to
You can push the grey station through
I'ma sit in the passanger, and rock Playstation 2
How da hell ??? been tweekin out
How you been sneekin out, spent weekends out
She'll be tired of trainin dat mutt
You probably be fakin like you came and you ain't even nut
Miss I'll pipe you til you get a pain in yo gut
The kid'll be responsible for changin yo strut
Wherever you hurt, I'ma rub it down
I be ready to smack it up, flip it in public now
I know how to get you hot, I know how to hit yo spot
If I take you home, I know how to keep you stylin
I know how to keep you smilin if I take you home, let's go
Repeat Chorus
I think it's just that ladies ???
I'm in love with my red 6, and got a crush on a navy Caddy
I like 'em D cup, bust, wit crazy fatties
They be wishin' I was just, they baby daddy
I'm the one that make it real easy
For you to just drop'em like he hot, like he Lil' Weezy
I ain't gon never make you feel sleezy
And I'ma put the roof up on the drop if it feel breezy
I love the way you smerk and giggle, jerk and wiggle
Throw yo legz up while I work the middle
Already told me how you strictly be witt'em
Now I'ma show you so much cash, that you'll quickly forget'em
I'm young, but know I'll have you in a bungalow
Fillin yo stomach wit Cris, yo lungz with dro
I'll have you sprung fa sho
It ain't gon be no limit where yo tongue will go, ya heard me?
Repeat Chorus with ad libs til fade out
You know them hoes don't want to see you happy baby
Make sure you tell em every detail 
Make sure you see see/CC 'em on that email 
Talk how that Mercedes gettin' detailed 
Mention that new C C  back at retail 
Them hoes be jeal', never wish me well 
Told my lady that I'm leggin' bitches like I'm Miguel 
Big mouth bitch we just call her Gmail
You know everybody had her Gmail 
My nigga Craig said "Deebo, that's a female" 
I say she fuckin like a nigga, that's a she-male 
Every crew have a  Shady  one just like D-12 
All she ride is dick, you ridin' that V12 
In that S6, talkin' on a 6S 
Not no gossip, just makin' moves at success 
These bitches flexin' on a baller alert
Guess they don't know, that's a bitch who need a baller allure oh you ain't know
Gossip just a broke people sport oh you ain't know 
Deep pockets, even deeper thoughts oh you ain't know
Snakes in the grass, keep it short oh you ain't know
Free Wi-Fi and it's cheap to talk, so, go 
Go tell your friends about it about it
Go tell 'em what you know
What you seen, how I roll, how I be on the low whoooa ohh-whoa
Go tell your friends about it about it
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair, singin' 'bout poppin' pills
Fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill
She don't want the key to your heart, she want the key to your whip 
If she had the key to your heart, she'll prolly key up your whip
I'm tellin' her, egos trip but the humble doesn't stumble baby
You feelin' yo'self, I'm the one that numb you baby
I seen it come together and I seen it crumble baby 
Let them keep score, we just do our numbers baby
Everybody talkin', I feel like a trendin' topic
#Ibetyourmouthbiggerthanyourpocket 
I got you and your bag, new Céline 
Got you Young Fly,  FawwwkUMean 
Let them groupies chat in the group chat
Niggas tryna shoot, they shot but don't know where the hoops at 
Bitch you know I'm ballin', if you smart, you would recruit that
Niggas catchin' plagues, ask me where the alley-oops at
Man you know this game is vicious, all they want is fame and riches 
Wifin' up the lamest bitches and they tellin' same as snitches
Listen, me and my bitches are like sisters
So of course, we give our opinion on everything, okay cool, granted
I'm never the type of female that'll call my bitches haters
if they give they opinion on my relationship if my relationship is fucked up
But bitch, if I tell you I'm happy with my relationship
If I tell you I'm happy with my nigga, just be happy that I'm happy
Bitch I ain't gotta lie to you, I'm grown
And they always wanna bring up what ya nigga did in the past
Okay cool, you was a hoe in past, bitch I still got you 
My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my grandma's funeral 
Used to roam on Queen now I sing Queen street anthems 
Used to hate attention now I pull up in that wagon
And I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix 
Now we get faded when we want girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless 
That's not love
Snakes in the grass, so I stay on the pavement
Survived the battle with animals and cavemen
And dead animals and dead men
I'm all in and my only friend is Amen
Keep your mouth closed, you wanna know why you die
The answer's right under your nose
Exposed to the street, in the game I don't cheat
I just play my position, get MVP
I get money, don't shit come free
It's my life and I run it even when
Keep my business in my pockets, don't wash with bleach
And I never show my hand, not even to me
Say what's on your heart if you're real
Cause the scars you can't see be the hardest to heal
And I used to chase money, now I have it brought
Cause you can only chase something that you haven't caught
If there's a summertime in hell, it's not as hot
You empty clip niggaz ain't got a shot
These diamonds on my neck are an eyesore
Now you decide if their to die for
Advice to my haters, do what I say now
Report to the nearest roof and take the fast way down
Thought it was love, how foolish of us
I do me, she do her, sometimes we do eachother
Look, as the crooked World revolves
Love spelt backwards is evol evolve
And Evil spelt backwards is live or live
And when death comes you better have lives to give
I spit that real talk like knives to ribs
And rats die ugly, die with kids
These niggaz is snitching and still living
I hope my words are like razors to the bitches
Niggaz pretend like they actually in
But when it go down they fuck around and be them
That blood look familiar when it's leaking
If you scared, go see a Deacon nigga
That ain't love
Life is but a dream
Ain't always what it seems
Meanwhile get your cake red velvet butter cream
Raise your glass and lets toast to when we didn't have
Hustle plus muscle equal success, I did the math!
I see these haters in passing, yeah they 'round
I be on the way up, they be on the way down
Now I can sit and talk shit like Skip Bayless
You looking for these shoes baby you can skip payless
Lifestyle A-list, young black and famous
Bunch of bad bitches in an Ipod playlist
Just another page in my success story
I make my worst enemies wish the best for me
Yeah DJ Clue Dessert Storm EA Sports Come on
NBA Live 2003 Fabolous Who Gon' Stop Me!!?
I hoop with the best of them swooped up the chest of them
dunked on a bunch caught ali-oops on the rest of them
I got the lean on the "J" now
it really don't matter if we play in arenas or playgrounds
throw it around the back so it look fly when I pass
just to avoid the block go high off the glass
I'm killing them out there they gon' have to bring caskets
this all I hear after the baskets
but I ain't even warm up
and still pull from where it counts for 3 points and leave the form up
you must be insane if you give me the lane or perimiter
the crossover will sprain every limb on ya
I never woulda, ever coulda
thought I could come off the baseline and jump over seven-footers
soon as you step out the locker room you now can see
how live it gets in 2003
Who gon' stop me when I'm in the lane?
I come to entertain you know its in the game
Who gon' stop me? go and get 5
I  D-up with 5 you know it gets live
I'm the crowd favorite and I believe the fans
love the way I finger roll it with either hand
my handles pull it through presses plus I can play the lane
and block shots like bulletproof vestes
I often be found in the paint waiting for I miss
so I can slam it back off the rebound
then I show off with class
look the other way when I throw off a pass
call it when I go off the glass
hope ya'll play better "D"
or I'ma keep scoring until the coach hold his hands like the letter "T"
When I put pressure on the ball they be feeling on lock
remind 'em of a jewel theif when I be stealing the rock
shorty over the summer you might have boosted an inch
but if you ain't ballin like me get used to the bench
and everybody know I does my thing
and play hard 'til the buzzer ring, yeah
Yeah DJ Clue Fabolous Desert Storm EA Sports Live 2003

We're live in New York City awaiting Loso
Oh there he is, there he is Loso, Loso, excuse me

What do you have to say about the way you have been treated throughout your career?
Just one question, one question
I said, fuck 'em all, motherfuck 'em all
Y'all done turned a good guy into a Chuckie doll
I would a been your friend 'til the end bitch
And guess it ain't no friends in this shit business
Just a bunch of assholes in a shit business
But they won't flush me down the toilet bowl without my tissue
These bitches talk shit out the same mouth that kiss you
These niggaz kiss ass with the same mouth that diss you
Eww, you niggaz disgust me
And they ain't talkin 'bout shit unless they discuss me
Let's talk about how I'm killin everything I touches
Or how I walked in this game with no crutches
No Diddy, No Dupri, No Dr  Dre
No Cash Money from Baby and no Rocs from Jay
And I'm still here still here, we still here still here
What does this break dude? It's still here
And dude talk, concernin New York
When I was runnin the city, you was learnin to walk
So I watched you niggaz take they first steps and I was happy for ya
Daddy was clappin for ya
But wasn't for me it probably wouldn't of happened for ya
So I rest my case, I'm a rappin lawyer
That's unless you wanna talk bad bitches
Section full of Bridezillas, that's mad bitches
No words, I describe 'em with letters best
They pretty as can 'B'/be, curvy as the letter 'S' S
They keep it 'G' G, they sweet as 'T'/tea T
Look good in the passenger seat of 'V' V
They ride double 'R' R, smell like double 'C' C
The bags are 'LV', 'D' or double 'G' G
Fly as hell hell, shades, wired cell hell
On 'E', sippin 'PJ', high as hell
And please don't even talk about swag nah
I'm cool and collective, a fool with perspective
I'm far from being typical, my respect is reciprocal
I already came up, you still on the zipper pull
And I would say my style is 5th Ave  meets Brooklyn
I keep the hood watchin, I got the streets lookin
They watch what I do, so they know what to do
Little money never told big money what to do nice
Money talks, if you speak Guap-anese
A language better known if you gettin cheddar homes
If not get a loan, use that like Rosetta Stone
And that way you can holla 'bout a dollar
I hear 'em cryin broke, they holla like a toddler
Come holla at yo guala, don't holla at Savalas
You'll end up down under tryin to holla at koalas
I keep that nine on me, ala Iguodala 
We can get it jumpin like the 'drolics on Impala
I feel like Nino lettin them Rottweilers off the collar
Somebody tell me something, What the fuck happened? huh?
Somebody talk to me, motherfuck rappin huh?
They infiltrated the game but who let in the Pookies? who?
Kingpins is snitchin that shit is not Lukey that's not cool
So fuck new friends, Lefty stay solo
'Cause who gon' watch your back after you kill Manolo?
Isn't it ironic Santana's own fella stabbed him? damn
The "King of New York" died while they yellow cabbed him
No "Carlito's Way", when I spot a hater drop him like a hot potato
You won't hear he got me later
Yeah I keep it gangsta but I'm a do it my way my way
The new day of the week is called "Myday" Myday

And there's nothin  these dudes ain't do that I , can't do at my 
earliest convenience , your girlie ain't foreseen since

They said sounded like the guy who's speech was a little slow uh huh, uh huh
Personally I think they was reachin a little dough
But now they callin just to get a feature so it'll blow 
I'm teachin my little bro
to stay on the grind and away from the leeches and little hoes
I'll lose the Black Star Power on broads 
Even devil worshippers got up outta the God
I know all you cowards is hard
Your career's dead so I send flowers and cards
With our regards, nigga
Uh, uh, nigga

Dip-low immunity
Shorty! just shake your hips slow and move wit me
Take a hit a this and sip slow and thoroughly
You're sneakin' out on your man, tip-toein' to the V
Cause I know you got him whipped though like wannabe
Let's put on a live strip show just you and me
But girl, I'm lookin' at them lips though like who is he?
They ain't never seen a whip, clothes or jewelry
So when I ask "you wanna leave the zip-code?"
Say "sure" and be me
But this is my party
Stroll by if you want to
Or ya'll can stay home
But why would you want to?
We gon' party, till we laid in graves
Sweat out our doobie braids and waves
Then scream "hey-hey-hey yo"
That groupie made a wave
Cause when she seen the whips and chains
She started talking 'bout she ready to be made a slave, c'mon
This is my party
So get fly if you like to
Get high if you like to cause I know you like to
Put your hands up as high as you like to
And if it feels good scream "hey-hey-hey yo"
I don't know about y'all
But we doin' it over here
All the glasses got liquid that blue in it over here
Cigars got somethin' sticky that's glueing it over here
Ladies movin' it over there, movin' it over here
I can fit a few in a Rover's rear
We havin' a good time, don't ruin it overs this
You see why we asks is to see ID
Cause girls will do anything for some VIP access
Me I relax this easy
Cause I'm used to ballin'
You could tell that these guys need practice
But if it was a problem then I would confront you
You saying "no" but ya eyes say you want to
But a pitcher that probably slugs, pitches and talk a put
I ride wit the top down and switch to the top-up look
Would you believe most these bitches go bop up shook
Their asses pokin' out like them pictures in pop up books
Oh yea! We's off the Richter Scale
Hate will get you, put in coffins quick as hell
If the ladies would show it off and thick as hell
For my hustlers knockin' off them bricks as well
And everybody, up north that's sick in jail
I probably feel y'all, send you all of the flicks in mail
The Street Family speed off in six SL's
To all them chicks that yell "hey-hey-hey-hey yo"
Shake your glasses back and forth to mix it well
Shake your ass back and forth as quick as hell
And just from lookin' at them thighs from the front view
Girl I know that these guys say they want you
If I wake up in the sand, clothes from yesterday
Same hoes from yesterday 
Lightin' clips to the same dro' from yesterday
Her hang-overs yesterday
You ain't mistaken we in Benz's today
But we had them Range Rovers yesterday
Sometimes I like slim, sometimes I like thick
Sometimes I combine them and I like thim slick
Thim slick probably went over your head
Couldn't lay up, I just went over for head
Made a change of plans when she bent over the bed
Now she on the balcony pint over the ledge

Not to save hoes or rescue anybody
But a nigga know what stress do to the body
And I done seen you in your best shoes buzzin' naughty

Than everything, I'd give it all, just for you, yeah
You're the one baby girl, I've never been so sure
Your skin's so pure, the type men go for
The type I drive the Benz slow for
The type I be beepin the horn, rollin down the windows for
Never been no whore
So to get you in closed doors, I buy you everything in those stores
This, that, and those yours
As long as Fabolous the only one you let that grin show for
You ain't gotta spend no more, I'm a put a rock on your hand
You ain't gotta say "we just friends" no more
I shine, you shine, it never been no flaws
I ain't like most who just wanna get in those drawers
'Cause every king need a queen
And with me and you girl I ain't tryna let a thing in between
It ain't a thing, nahmean, chicks hate, show 'em the ring and the green
And let your middle finger be seen, it's on
Girl I'd trade it all, money, cars and everything

Uh, don't front ma', you know the way I ball's to pick and roll
Like Stockton and Malone when we play the mall
I be goin out my way to call
'Cause I love the way your hips make your jeans seem like they too small
Them see-through tops with your titties exposed
When you kick off them shoes there ain't bitty whose toes as pretty as those
That blonde hair look good, straight down, bun or the braids
And I ain't gon' talk about them light-browns under your shades
Bust right, thus tight
Got a thick set of thighs and struts likeuh
Yo' the game taught this brother to mack
But I think I slipped when I saw them full lips covered with Mac
You got everything that others would lack
Along with the F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S
Your patience I personally admire
'Cause I started out a player now I'm 'bout to have my jersey retired, for real
There ain't no "mights" or "maybe"
I done did wrong, so I'm a make sure it's right for my baby
You know how tight that my day be

All, even give up my street dream
All, anything to have you on my team
All, babygirl I'd trade it all
Fabolous, talk to 'em
I assume I'm so into you
Cause even before we hit the bedroom I was friends wit you
If they ask, I ain't got to say "whom?" in them interviews
My sweet thing never believe the rumors, that been ain't true
The fact I had numerous friends is true
But you was wifey, could change me to a groom in a minute boo
Maybe, my sense of humor gets into you
But girl, they could make a perfume from the scent of you
I wanna take you where it feel like June and December too
So what you think about Cancun 'til the winter boo?
I don't know what the other consumers you been with do
I put a day aside, to go to Bloomy's and spend with you
Like any other man, I wanna zoom to the clinic too
but I wanna see if me and my junior's identical
A dude put a wound on the skin of you
I swear to everything, that same afternoon, I'll be in the news
feel me?
C'mere girl, come and take a walk with me
so I can take you places you don't often be
C'mon ma, come and get lost with me
as far as them other chicks, can't get them off of me
everlastin', love in a whole 'nother fashion
all I'm askin, is let me cash in
cause I'd give all the passion, all of the Sean John fashion
in orderly fashion, perhaps when
you figure out, exactly what Diddy 'bout
Cause we could take this whole city out
Now who gon' stop us, who gon' knock us?
Top us, we can't find coppers to lock us
Lear jets and choppers, love hella proper
Seperate the weak from the obso-lete, hard to keep, I got ya
I rocked ya, word to Big Poppa, I got ya, yeah
What you want huh?
I'm ready to give this all up for you shorty
get your mind right
Well this newcomer's known, to move with the seasons
couple winter lodges, few summer homes
I'm there for every "ooh", "um", and moan
and make sure when the new Hummer roams, the shoes come in chrome
I ain't new at buying white, yellow, and cucumber stones
that send chills through a woman bones, but life gets gruesome alone, 
even though I got the kinda bread that won't matter if a few crumbs are blown
flights, I done flew some alone, 
now I wanna wake up everyday with you in a new number zone
Mama mia, it's you I'ma phone, 
just to erase all the negative views from your dome
and I promise this fellas G, it's so gangsta it'll calm all that jealousy
and drama you tellin me, so mama come yell at me
so I can put the top down, and we can "Cruise/Cruz" like Tom and Penelope
my charm is a felony 
Fabolous, Diddy, Desert Storm, we rock on, and rock on
'Cause I know how niggas is when you in the streets and you hustlin you know how niggas is
'Cause you was one of them niggas you know what I'm sayin?
You on the corner and tryin to get your money you see a nigga rollin a ride a benz or a beamer
You be like fuck that nigga youknow what I'm sayin? 
'Cause I'll, I'll murder that nigga I'll rob that nigga you know what I'm sayin?
Now I'm the nigga in the benz and the beamer you know what I'm sayin?
Drivin that other corner so I know the same speeches comin up you know what I'm sayin?
It's all good though, I ain't trippin, I'm that nigga
I'm old enough to know better, young enough to not give a fuck
Rather hold my head high and die, than live and duck
'Member I was down to die just to live it up
But life's a bitch and that judge is quick to give her up
They say life is short, instead we lookin through them bars
Gotta keep yo' head up, I be lookin to the stars
I've been through alot, wasn't lookin for no cars
Didn't kill me though, now I'm hear lookin at the scars
Sometimes you get caught by people lookin from a far
That's how it is when you out here takin cookies from the jar
That's what my son said they came and took him in his draws
He support the family they took his mama favorite bra
The feds snatched my favorite boy
These the rainy days they say you should be savin for
But when sun shines no one carry umbrellas
And if they did we would look at them as dumb fellas
I'm tryin to become somethin they probably become jealous
Have alot to say about it but afraid to come tell us
I'm hear to beat the odds that was set against me
Wish the worst luck to anyone who bet against me
I wanna be somebody somebody that's never been
No squares in my circle best shape I ever been
I'm growin up my daddy planted a seed
My mama wanted me with a plan to succeed
I was that kid in the ghetto hand full of seeds
But I'm here now and I don't plan to recede
Sometime I think I lucked up at the right time
Imagined I would have fucked up that night slime
It hurts to even think about it
Would be in these streets thirsty tryin to get a drink about it
Black hoodie, I'll pull that quatro cinco 'bout it
Put that iron to yo' clothes like I'm takin wrinkles out it
Take every Franklin, Grant, Jackson and Lincoln out it
Look you in yo' eyes and tell you don't you even think about it
So as you hear me droppin this rhyme
Know my opportunity could have been stopped at a dime
The life you chose come from lack of options sometime 
Gotta do what you gotta do, even optin to crime
And who am I? without name droppin it I'm 
Someone who saw the top and didn't stop he just climbed
Someone who get money without droppin a dime
And transform to yo' leader in my Optimus Prime
So, for dinner, we stoppin at Prome
'Round of yo' patron, topped with a lime
Hold 'em up, look at yo' niggas and say
There was no way out but we figured a way
And now we chill, load it up and steal
We just wish a nigga would but we know a nigga will
But for real, good is how you feel
But soon as a nigga good is as a nigga will 
And we don't owe these niggas nothin
Put that in a nigga will
You used to, yeah 
You used to call me on my trap phone
Late night when you need those drugs
Call me on my trap phone
Late night when you need those drugs
Cause I know when that trapline bling

Cause I know when that trapline bling
That can only mean one thing

Say you got that work and you got pounds now
I see you Charged Up cause you the plug now 
Ever since I left the city, you
Started gettin' money, now you got hoes
Spendin' hella bands at the new store
Hangin' with some lames I've never seen before
Trapline bling
Mean one thing
When the pay callin', that's bae callin', I played the field now I'm play callin'
In the old days, it was Jays callin', now it's Lenny sayin "Jay's callin'"
And them some old hoe just hit this number, want the wood, tryna get this lumber 
Got me soundin' like X in Belly, "How the fuck did you get this number?!"
Know these girls love a street mogul that catch plays and eat noble
With the Balmains, knees ripped open, and the burnout, that flip open
Trap king need a trap queen, we call that trap royalty
If we lick together, we'll be rich forever, call that trap loyalty wooo
So stay down, I'ma hit you back, got one, tryna get two back
Whip a Benz, tryna get two back, let a real nigga sit you back
Fly you in then get flew back, got your ex tryna get you back
Grab the mic, tell that bitch move back
I would like to make a shout out to
All my hustlers out here that just love to grind
You gon' have to call me back another time
Bitch I got El Chapo on the other line
So only call me on my trap phone 
Late night when you need those drugs
Can you tell me something? Why you all on my line 
Tellin' me that I'm a liar?
Thinkin' I'm out with these hoes
When I'm, really at the studio
I'm out here in these streets riskin' my freedom just to
Give you a better future

Which means I'm, takin' risks and prosperin'
You used to call me on my trap phone

Miss each other when we do our trap ting
But when we link, you already know the happenin'
She gotta hustle like my hustle so I figure she for me
And we both chasin' dreams so it's bigger than money
When I met her, she was grindin', I was diggin' that youngin'
Was chasin' money but she wasn't chasin' niggas with money
And she a hustler, all she needed was that support system
I cashed out, she stacked up went out and bought bid'ness
Most girls woulda' copped bags and bought Christians
I ain't judgin' I'ma save it for the court system
I just see that she 'bout somethin' and thought different
And if it ain't about nothin', she abort mission
Ya boy vision is get money, avoid prison
And shorty make sure that the boy isn't
slippin' or slackin' or trippin' or lackin'
I save that upfront dough and flip all the back ends
Trap king done got to the throne from the dungeon
Rockin' that trapstar from New York to London, yeah
Trap king need a trap queen, that's royalty
Told we'll be rich forever, that's loyalty
Baby get whatever from papa, that's spoilty
Hustle like Russell so I need a young Kimora Lee
Both from the mud so we know know that soil be
Don't slip but we know how slick that that oil be
Gotta keep a stash for the bail and that lawyer fee
Still play Santa cause I got her every toy you see
Rolex crowns, his and her accordingly
And we drink royally, the Vodka is royally
Cheers to the new deal, cheers to the new wheels
Feels like thrones and they give massages

On state roll like a lunatic

Lets go
All the bitches say unfuckwitable
And real niggaz say unfuckwitable
24/7 365 how the game dead, when I'm still alive 
Hold up
I'm hotter than a fugitive
Americas most wanted that's swag lucadive
Unfuckwitable, slanging that mineral
Talking that G talk, living like a general
10 bottles in the club, sound like the minimum
My niggaz some killers for real, I'm talking federal
If its fuck you, then fuck you
Never no subliminal
Stacking ones everyday, active criminal
Me and 20 million cash look identical
If you broke and you in the streets, you something pitiful
Hoes say they love a nigga
After they fuck a nigga
But I ain't looking for love
Thats for them sucker niggaz
Let him be your man I'll gladly be the other nigga
Cuddle with dog all winter, I'm your summer nigga
Hustle from sun up, hustle til its sun down
Bullshit aside I'm realest killer in town
Host of niggaz in the streets, they know how I get down
Got'a bad bitch riding shotty when the top let down now look
As a young boy I use to have hoop dreams
Now I'm like shine I still got hoop dreams
I ain't feeling niggaz, I ain't that sentimental
I got no words for 'em, lets just keep it instrumental
I put it down where I stay, words to incidental
And guess who opened the doors you niggaz entered in through
Y'all will never measure up using my ruler
You're more soft than a second year high schooler
My nigga HOV told me finish my breakfast
And now I'm looking at you niggaz like breakfast
French toast, turkey bacon
Shit's in bad shape, too many squares circulating
Money talks and y'all voices are unheard
When they ask about us, one word
"unfuckwitable," we be in the town too
That's why them boys call us the "not fucking around crew"
Brooklyn keep on taking it, known to get our Debo on
When you touch down, bow down get your Tebow on
You won't say it in the streets, don't say it in your tweets
You won't say it when we meet, don't say it on them beats
Real nigga shit, RNS
Last night was a movie, starring us
I don't understand how niggaz insist to knows bout
How we spend car money to glist our rollz out
Play bars and buy the Cris and Moes out
Flash benjies just to twist the hoez out
Fabolous the one from the Menatti Mix
Known to have more kicks than karate flicks
Slim nigga in a big body six
Wit enough doe and pull to gotti fixed
If I wasn't rappin I'd have a ???
Down south in a town you never heard before
Dealin wit weight Columbians would murder for
??? cats I keep burnin' for furthermore
I'm the nigga every freak press be in a sleek s
That'z gon need week rest after greekfest
Jump in private jets just to sneak west
Bet these calico shots rip through ya weak flesh
Niggaz want it, now they get it
Bitches on it, now they wit it
Flooded up and custom fitted
Tinted up and bb kinted
Y'all gon wonder how we did it
Now sports the kind of nigga you could spot everyday
Sip lots of cherry 'ze in a hot chevy 'le
I know's a few niggas that plot to bury J
Wanna scar my face put a shot in my derrier
What you gon do when we send shots from every way
We got perion while y'all got perrier
I strut past in diamonds that could cut glass
Wit dime bitches that'll make a nigga nut fast
Now I gotta fiend bout to throw some chrome on a quarter
Cop a crown and put stones on a border
Smoke the trees now that'z grown underwater
Still keep 9's that'll put ya bones out of order
Got the condo cats will leave ya dead for
Chicks givin sarges and crucial head for
That make local cops go to feds for
Anything you want nigga now I got the bread for
New York is gettin money
VA is gettin money
L A  is gettin money
Fabolous is gettin money
Fabolous so cool I could play texas
In avirex's light gray Lexus
Rockin white diamonds wit a gray necklace
Fuck and bounce don't even stay for breakfast
We doin shit that'll make maid neck twist
Wit a fancy chick we pay to pet kiss
Fuck studs I'm bout to throw bagettes in my ear
And be getting head from brunettes in a lear
If you ain't talkin money I don't wanna chit chat
Throwin parties in Jamaica when I hit plat
Receivin chips thugs catch cases for
Make bitches beat me til my waist is sore
Sport come through nigga like checks on the first
Doin the bump drivin a Lex in reverse
Now we don't pop it unless it's a hundred a wop
And I'ma keep hittin y'all like an abusive pops
Repeat Chorus
Y'all gon wonder how we did it
Y'all gon wonder how we get it
F-A-B-O, L-O-U-S
You see what I can't understand, is how somebody have a lifetime friend
That they been through thick and thin with, and they just fall out over the simplest shit man
Like, but that same person a be in a relationship with a triflin ass mu'fucker
And keep takin him back, shit is crazy
The karma of fuckin over a good person, is the asshole you end up with
Get a taste of your own medicine, funny you the one who end up sick
Always took you back, even though it made my friends upset
Told me I should blow you off havent got that wind up yet 
Know how many days I hurt, many nights I been up stressed
Thought that we have been in love, maybe I just been upset
When you crossed me you lost me, now if I was guardin Derrick Rose
I would be more understandin but, you ain't Derrick Rose
You was my number one but ummm you ain't Derrick Rose
You tryin to make a point again, you ain't Derrick Rose
You just on some bullshit bitch you ain't Derrick Rose
I'm a lover and a fighter fight for what I love
But you made certain of bitches I think nothin of
Ask myself why fight when it's long been over
God gives the hardest battles to the strongest soldiers 
So I fight for us long as there is reason to
You wanted to give up on us long as there was season two
Cool! You gonna need me one day
And if it's sunday that one day 'gon be monday
That's how fast things change sometime
Niggas play the tough role I Ving Rhames sometime
Like, like, like I don't want that bitch back!
I mean I want her but I don't want the bitch back!
She say she want him but she don't want that nigga back!
That nigga act like I ain't had a nigga back
You're gonna need me, one, day So much pain in a sample
You're gonna want me back, in your arrrrrrmmmmmsssss!!!! So much pain in some of our hearts
You're gonna need me, one, day I just want a pain free heart, I don't ask for much, Fab what's good though?
You're gonna want me back, in your arrrrrrmmmmmsssss!!!! Let's talk to her real quick
We start with I love you, I think we got the power to grow
Would've gave up but there's no coward in Joe
Funny thing about it all you checked my twitter every hour or so
And then you bring this fake shit to our reality show
Been half of many years, lookin for devotion
It's weird, your feelings but I put 'em into motion
I dictate the what's and why's What else? the how and when
You ain't learn to separate your now from then
I keep my distance 'cause when I'm near my head is hurtin
Exhausted every road to friendship but it's never workin
And me I met the sweetest you know y'all met in person
Bottom line I made you then made a better version
Tried to give you good advice but you ain't heed it much
To figure you ain't need it but all I can do is seed it
Told you you 'gon fuck around and end up sick
You chose dick from this nigga from the New York Knicks
My nig, you so spiteful, that ain't the way we act
That cock was inserted in you, how could it pay me back?
I know you said when we were over you start aimin bigger 
But you can't have anonymity with famous niggas
Know you thinkin my happiness is a front
How would you ever know? Happiness is what you wanted 
So unidentifiable when that armor never led up
And fucked me real good, but karma fucked you better
You're gonna need me, one, day 
You're gonna want me back, in your arrrrrrmmmmmsssss!!!! 
You're gonna need me, one, day 
You're gonna want me back, in your arrrrrrmmmmmsssss!!!! 
And never miss a good thing 'til it leave you, I finally realized I don't need you
You want me back? You know your gonna need me back, gotta have you back babe
And heart broken when you left my world, boy you know you should have kept this girl
I was there for you, Now I don't know what you 'gon do, without me babyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!
That was the last thing you said to me, right now that you still wish I was here with you
You want me back, you gonna want me back
no!!! I said I want you want you want you want you want you, baby baby!
You gonna want me back!
Want me back, and I dpn't want you back,
Sick motherfuckers!
Go head, throw up nigga
Yea yea ok, I know you
I know, I know
Even when I had smaller digits
The kid was never, a playa hata or baller bigot
Every week, pay em all a visit
I bring Pamela Lee to the P's so we all can dig it
I popped enough alcohol so we all could swig it
Guns, stand them up they be as tall as midgets
O k, I'll rap a little faster
But do I really sound like I turned from a rapper to a pastor
I'm like you except I date supermodels
The cars that I drive, the state troopers follow
We get the same parties probably
My stones look like sunshine, yours probably cloudy
And I dont front for nothin'
I likes, I gets, I want for nothin'
I'm givin' ya straight answers
And I'd rather be dead than livin wit hate cancer
Say wha you wanna say, talk wha you wanna talk
WE DONT GIVE A FUCK!
Look how you wanna look, grill if you wanna grill
WE DONT GIVE A FUCK!
Act how you wanna act, front if you wanna front
WE DONT GIVE A FUCK!
Live how you wanna live, try if you wanna die
WE DONT GIVE A FUCK!
I just used to post on the corner, roast marijuana
I'd be on the coast of Tawanna
Bitches who look, close to Madonna,
Dosie cabanna, toast by a ?
I 'posed to be wanna of those dudes ridin in Testaroastas upon ya
Not the ? but I'm gonna, I keep toastin the armor
for niggaz who supposed to be drama
I mostly just wanna, get fed garlic toast and lasagna
Get head while I'll roast in a sauna
F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S, how can you hate that?
And I aint concerned wit the scandals
Cause its all bullshit my attroneys can handle
Ya insides be burnin like candles
Rippin down posters, turnin' the channels
You wanna end up on the ern on the mantle nigga, yea
I look at these brothers and laugh
Jealous niggas dont hate havin, just others that have
I still got love for the av ,
Come through to give ya niggas girls baby mothers my math
I speak on others behalf, only hate makin money
and gotta give the government half
You know this brother live last
And not even Mike seen Jordans in the colors I have
I used to run from undercovers like Shaft
That was until this young playa got shoved into the draft
Now I'm covered in ice, like Bruce Lee's body
Niggas is scared, to lose these hotties
Talk if you wanna talk, grill if you wanna grill
We dont give a fuck nigga
Front if you wanna front, try if you wanna die
If you live its luck nigga
We good, we good
Been a couple years since a nigga got put on
Say ya boy a star, he outta here, he gone
There ain't much that you can do that I can't do for me

Get with the Scorpio, I'm gettin' more Fritos
They gettin' chips but I'm gettin' Doritos
'Bout to get more Cheetos, I get you wet have you bustin' like torpedoes
You came three times, you tryin' to four-peat though?
She said "We good, nigga you try to kill me?"
I'm tryin' to make sure you good, do you feel me?
Knock on that nigga and tell him you good
when he said "Come over" tell him you would
But see the way that my shit is set up, you in the bed and you cannot get up
Focus on you homie, get your bread up, things will get easier keep your head up
She with the game now she throw the set up
and she fuckin' me good and she make the bed up
So we good, we good

Back in the day we was good little niggas

Y'all must of thought that we wouldn't get money heh shit we a good seven figures
Give us a shot and we pullin' the trigger and pull up on niggas like skrrt!
Pull up with bitches like her, full of chinchilla the fur

You know them haters be tryin' to take shots bow!

The feeling, we good on that fake shit  we out here tryin' to stay far from it

Too many flavors to do on these haters but do me a favor don't do me no favors
We good, we good
Getting it on
Brooklyn we back
Ghetto Fab
Like that I got on, I got on
From the rocks to the trees
We be like this
From the blocks to the P's
Streets be like this
From the cock to the squeeze
Heat be like this
Ghetto F-A-B
Keep it like this
I'm an ordinary gent, in a strawberry Bent
Air Force Ones, check out the Burberry print
It's the kid, who do you fuck with
Ya'll should stop starring, unless Gucci make bullet proof buckets
Street family boys, kisses on they cheek
And why the D A  and see the whip misses in a week
Ghetto gotta admire, man on it like this
And Prada work, retirement plan on my wrist
Niggas don't like that I got on
It's easier to find Bin Ladden, then the nikes that I got on
I used to love apartments, now I'm laughing in a mini mansion
I feel like I'm in a glove compartment
I'm far from jealous
But you ain't smoking good if what you buy don't look like the ?
I'm the reason your chillin'
It's no problem ridin? up
Puttin' a few of these in your melon
Why I'm breezing and yelling, ghetto 
Ay yo, never get caught holding a gram
Never take a bitch word over your man
Stay close to him
Never let em know where you live
Never let get familiar with your dough or your kids
Put the toast to em
Always stay quiet and humble
But don't be scared to take it to the knife or the gun in a rumble
I could show you how to get your neck broke
Stretch coke, the middle of the ocean on a mean duplex boat
Look here, there is no competitor
See now with the space ship doors, they open up regular
Get it on with the hard plastic
My sixteens had niggas feel like they trippin' off acid
Trust me, I can't see a loss
Know that if you wack me, you can't be a boss
Ryde or die, cry or lie, get your hustle on
Hold the block down, for life, truly yours
Keep it like this
We be like this
Streets be like this
Heat be like this
Keep it like this
Dram', y'knahmean?

Shoe box full, no sneakers though
Just moved in, it's been a week or so
Brand new coupe, so that she could go
White Bent' white Bent', light tint light tint
Ridin like "what the fuck is an indictment?"
Spend ten thou' for excitement
That's how the day goes, that's how the nights went
Louis bags, Balenciagas
The ones talked about by the fashion bloggers
You know me, I'm a Murciélago
In the same lime green as the Air Max joggers
But if it wasn't here, will she wanna go?
You don't wanna ask but you wanna know
Will my baby weather the storm?
Stick around 'til the weather is warm, hey
She likes shopping but never trendy
A little Gucci, maybe Fendi
Island hoppin, the west Indies
Diddy said that  It's All About The Benjies 
Ki Tao Ki Tao, Phillipe Chow Phillipe Chow
Reservations, we could sleep now
Ask how much, I don't allow such naw
Pull a Air Max out ya reptile clutch

You wanna do it B I G , you need a Lil' Kim
Raise her hand high, look in the man eye
I don't know 'em your honor, can't lie
Money comes money comes, money goes money goes
So you need to blow it like a runny nose
On a lady who ain't turn 180
Place no one above ya,  Sweet Sadie 
Sun stop shinin, she never got shady
She could of watched 'em box you in like a Brady
But she stood up, like "what up?"
It's a cold world, zip the coat, put the hood up

Yellow everything lemon and sour jewels

Enjoy the best of everything we paid our dues

But this aint no joy ride when my boys ride
somewhere somebody boy died and never will your boy hide
I'm on frontline no matter how drastic
but otherwise you can find me where the cash is in love with the rapids

Addicted to fashion, diamonds, flashin'
but the money music and fast cars is my passion
I'm no newbie, nor am I a has been

I often speak through my actions
but paint pictures with words that you can close your eyes and imagine
Yeah, yo Cain what up nigga
Why wouldn't these bitches love us nigga?
Why wouldn't these niggas hate us huh?
Why wouldn't they Fab?
Yeah, Desert Storm, uh, yeah, uh
Why wouldn't I talk as greasy as cheese steak meat
In a strawberry Range, pie crust piping on the cheesecake seats
I'm known for hittin' women's soft spots 
With Princess cut Canaries the size of lemon cough drops
I'm right behind 'em in the Porsche drop
Linen soft top, sick chain with 20 point rocks
Take your bitch, why wouldn't I?
The whip got chrome shoes, cream leather seats with old wooden sides
Uh, yeah, what's really poppin', usually boys know
This ghetto superstar with the Bruce Lee-roy glow
Niggas has to hate the outcome 
Plus I'm in a throwback from the same year they assassinated Malcolm
Make so much ends, I got to find faster ways to count 'em 
A minute on the block, how fast I make a thousand? Cain
That nigga you love to hate, still hug blocks and bubble weight
All for the love of cake
Baby girl, why wouldn't fellas stop ya?
After we come through the hood in helicopters 
The dro I got in this wood, is hela-proper
We do the thing, how could they tell us not ta
Why wouldn't this joint make you wanna dance?
Why wouldn't these jewels make you wanna glance?
Why wouldn't this whip make you wanna ride?
And why wouldn't this thing be on my side?
Why wouldn't this game have you on your knees?
Why wouldn't these 20's be on the V's?
Why wouldn't this money make you wanna hate?
Why wouldn't I what?
Why wouldn't I pull up to the spot, yellow Azure ok
Dressed in yellow linen, covered in Canaries never a flaw 
Why shouldn't I wear this much ice
The princesses in my ear, are clear and cut right
Why wouldn't I talk this slick why not?
With a watch and bracelet this flooded, and a cross this sick?
So why wouldn't I get at hoes I mean
To a nigga gettin' money like myself, a little brain that's minimal 
Might talk but I live it though, sick chain glitter roll
Never sleep and don't stop gettin dough
Uh, hold up Cain, uh, why wouldn't I have samples of raw 
In Akademik sample velours
Hypnotic samples to pour
The European sample Azure
Wheel on the right side 'B' with the wings stamped on the door
It's the street family boss, I land by the shores
Get pampered by whores, eat scampy and claws
The kid's been trampeled before by a tramp with no flaws 
That's up to they get cramps in they jaws
I keep tefs jammed in the four
Amp weed to draw, end up in a wheelchair ramp by your door
Why wouldn't this joint make you wanna dance?
Why wouldn't these jewels make you wanna glance?
Why wouldn't this whip make you wanna ride?
And why wouldn't this thing be on my side?
Why wouldn't this game have you on your knees?
Why wouldn't these 20's be on the V's?
Why wouldn't this money make you wanna hate?
Why wouldn't I huh? Why wouldn't I what?
After a million scanned on it 
Why wouldn't the Range look like it got 20-inch ceiling fans on it woo
Only reason you in my face ma'am
Is cause I got the same Nikes that Jordan had on in "Space Jam"
Why wouldn't I chase chips
Come through Aves, like "Pluto Nash" in Coupes that look like spaceships
Ridiculous bracelet and the outrageous 
Watch with flawless rocks, invisible placement
Uh, I oughta feel like a boss 
Why wouldn't I get a 100 an appearance, quarter mil a endorse
I oughta feel some remorse
Cause I'm killin' 'em out there, and a stick shift sport utility Porsche
Yeah, I know when you see us, it be pissin' you off
Cause you would think we paid a fortune for the shit that we floss
Spend summers in my Sicily loft 
Whole crib, interior decoration done by Christian Dior
Baby girl, I got cops thats on the payroll
Jet skies, and speed boats docked up in Barbados
Green and cream Tims, brocolli and potatoes 
Why wouldn't you see the Storm for the rocks and these tornadoes
Sometimes I amaze sometimes I disappoint
Sometimes I blow this paper like it's just a joint
Sometimes I look at change like it's just some coins
Like Shaq at the line, you pro'ly missed the point
This perspective which angle you looking from
When you take a chance ever wonder who you took it from
I'm from Brooklyn son got no problem taking nothing
So I figured I could take nothing and make it something
Tell 'em faking ass niggaz they won't make it frontin'
Tell 'em girls lose they clothes and get the shaking something

She gotta donkey with a Juan Valdez
UH! Keep it clean cut like bald heads
UH! Been playin with that green long as Paul Pierce
So you gotta ball harder than the ball players
All she wanna know, is there a mall near us
Can't fault her, the last nigga spoiled her
But he ain't beat it up, I assault her
Should've seen her come to me when I called her
Slow strut like she walkin to the altar
Hand bag on her arm cost four bills
And she ain't gotta beg, borrow or steal
Often imitated, never duplicated
They say she a dime, I say she underrated NICE!!!
I just met her so the next solution
Dead my old chick, execution
You what's up girl, ain't gotta ask it
I dead 'em all now, I buy the caskets
They should arrest you or whoever dressed you
Ain't 'gon stress you, but I'm a let you know
Girl you be killin 'em, you be killin 'em

Congratulations You be killin 'em, girl you be killin 'em

Camera in the mirror BBM Pose
Still killin them hoes, you still killin them hoes
You still killin them hoes
Brooklyn,

Rollin, gold two seater
Stash in the dash
Hole through heaters
Blockahhhhh put holes through beaters
Ghetto Fab stroll through Cheetahs
Ballin, Brooklyn don
Addicted to Cris' hooked on Dom
15 G's hookers on
Ma, I wanna see how you look in thongs
Hustlin, guys that send Po's
Cause I chop rocks the size of mentos
Blame me,I tried to hint hoes
Look at the hurt your eyes will squint closed
Pimpin' here's a new way to flirt
Listen to the two way alert
It goes 2 way beeps in song's beat
Lets go VIP boo raise your skirt
I'm Gangsta
Ya'll just wannabe's
Federal Agents on their P's
30 grand 28 on the keys
Gotta good lawyer I'm gonna squeeze
Thuggin' jeans and Tim's
Fitted to the front lean the brim
Ride but never on teenage rims
And I keep a chick's face between limbs
Stylin ya'll heard about my kick game
I'm on the parkway see me at the Knick game
Probably seen this tatted on your chick frame
F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S
Ridin Ya'll know as well I do
That's the way you can tell I flew
So I got a deal I sell pies too
Cause before I hit the pens I'm gettin bailed by Clue
Cruisin top on the Mercedes low
Turn us up when you hear this on the radio
Blastin with the nineteen eighty flow
Make the necks on the ladies go wooo wooop
Holla that's what a pretty thug will do
Hit Branson get a fifty jug or two
Ya'll throwin on them gritty mugs for who
Like ya'll don't know what fifty slugs will do
Hatin I just bought the uz'
I put ya'll in the front page articles
I got em lookin at the billboard charts confused
And I still freestyle to start the Clue's
Reppin I'm that kid about the doe
I done copped coke and started droughts before
Shit Platinum out the door
Now I drop the top down just to shout to hoes
Holla back back back back Hoooo Hoooo! until music fades
Nigga, don't tell me what niggas say about me
Tell me why they feel comfortable tellin' you 
The saddest stories comes from those who once had the glory
Had the foreigns, diamond watches and the baddest shorties
Now they in their latter 40s, bunch of kids, scatted shorties
No respect from the neglect, they call they daddy Corey
I'm from a different cloth, that ain't the pattern for me
It's levels to this shit, it's different categories 
Can't be like them niggas out here lookin' fat and gaudy
They ain't never won no rings but be mad at Horry
Talkin' 'bout, "man that nigga don't deserve that shit"
Like "I was really in these streets, I used to serve that shit"
We started from the bottom, had to topsy-turn that shit
Get it while the gettings good after that preserve that shit
My ex texted me last night, but I curve that shit
Coulda end up hittin' it, be too late to swerve that shit ERR!
That's a young mistake, Lord knows I made me some word
I love gettin' brain, that never made me dumb
All that did was made me cum, swear these hoes made me numb 
Only feelings for this bitch, you been shoulda gave me some
I knew niggas who had some bread never gave me crumbs feel me
Drink the whole fuckin' juice and never saved me some feel me
I know how young niggas feel, I had to live through shit
See the world as constipated, nobody gon' give you shit
I learned that niggas gon be niggas, yeah we shouldn't do it
But hoes gon' be hoes, they just ain't admittin' to it
Where I been? Gettin' to it, goin' through and gettin' through it
Runnin' round, killin' shit and tellin' cops "I didn't do it" Niicee
That's why they call me "Young OG"
And I'mma spit this dope shit until my tongue OD
I flew my shorty in from Cali and she brung OG
She got me chillin' in my city but my lungs OT
And fuck them niggas online, reply why?
Broke niggas talking cause it's free wifi
"I hear you  you know the problem with you lil niggas?
You think you know everything about the world and you don't know shit
Well I see you got yourself a lil business goin'
Well that's good, that's good when you make that paper
But when you makin' paper you gotta learn some rules too
You gotta learn the difference between guns and butter
It's two types of niggas in this world: they're niggas with guns and niggas with butter
Now what are guns? The guns, that's the realist thing
It's stocks and bonds, artwork, you know the shit you appreciate with value
What's the butter? Cars, clothes, jewelry
all that other bullshit they don't mean shit after you buy it
That is what it's all aboutguns and butter baby!
Lil dumb motherfuckers "
Young money on the floor! Trak money on the beat
That's right man, the young and sexy
You're only young as you feel, haha, ya know?
Let's get it in, 25 and younger
I see you smiling shorty, I see it in your eyes
Security let her through, trust me man she's alright
She's alright, she's alright, she's alright
Cause she's gon ride, she's gon ride, she's gon ride
To the beat y'all! Till the motherfucking champagne and weed is gone!
I'm so VIP, and Notorious for doing it B I G  girl
You ain't gotta see ID, I'm a rich young man
Clean button up wit the rich young pairs
Out of you young ladies, which one cando it to the beat y'all
Young niggaz get funny, just to get a name
So you know I came with the heat y'all!
You know I got a little money, got a little fame
But you know I came from the streets y'all
If you wanna act funny, I can do the same
And when Pharrell let the beat fall
Let me see you get your hands up high y'all
Just like you're reaching for the sky y'all
For the young sexy and fly y'all
Roll another one, let's get high y'all
From the high heels to low cuts
To the dude in the fast car wit the slow strut girl
They wanna catch J  Jackson
But the money's longer than a stretch Maybach Benz
They say I'm fly enough to do better
But pimp enough to not give a fuck
They say I'm old enough to know better
But young enough to not give a fuck
Tell Stella to move back, if she want Her Groove Back
I get my young man on, then the young man gone
Let's get money again, and even if you ain't
I'll make you feel twenty again, so!
Let me see you get your hands up high y'all
Just like you're reaching for the sky y'all
For the young sexy and fly y'all
Take another shot, let's get high y'all
I'm too young to be sprung
And you can tell I'm too blessed to be stressed
My move is too smooth, on top of that I dress to impress
The walk is so chilled, not to mention the Talk is so Real
We all gotta get old, but before I do I'm a ball outta control
Live young! die rich! woo!
Troubled tears, they'll land you here
Open your eyes, it's all a disguise
The fear that you feel, is not real, not real
Similar sky, similar ties
But I know all about you, I do
It's not real, yeah 
Look, the saddest story comes from those who once had the glory
Had the foreigns, diamond watches and the baddest shorties
Now they in their latter 40s, bunch of kids, scattered shorties
No respect from the neglect, they call they daddy Corey
I'm from a different cloth, that ain't the pattern for me
There's levels to this shit, it's different categories
Can't be like these niggas out here, lookin' fat and gaudy
They ain't never won no rings, but be mad at Horry
Talkin bout "Man that nigga don't deserve that shit"
Like "I was really in these streets, I used to serve that shit"
We started from the bottom, had to topsy-turn that shit
Get it while the gettins' good, after that preserve that shit
My ex texted me last night, but I curve that shit
Coulda end up hittin' it, be too late to swerve that shit
That's a young mistake, Lord knows I made me some
I love gettin' brain, that never made me dumb
All that did was made me cum, swear these hoes made me numb
Only feelings for this bitch, you been shoulda gave me some
I knew some niggas who had some bread never gave me crumbs
Drink the whole fuckin' juice and never saved me some

That's why they call me Young OG
And I'ma spit this dope shit until my tongue OD
I flew my shorty in from Cali and she brung OG
She got me chillin' in my city but my lungs OT, yeah
And fuck them niggas online, reply why
Broke niggas talkin' cause it's free wifi
My son gon' be a king, I tell him every morning
I put my chain on his neck, right now it's heavy on him
One day it'll all be his, so I'm forever on him
I test him all the time and I never warn him
I pop quiz him like stop listenin' and drop wisdom
Pops vision  the bottoms crowded, the top isn't
We talk guap missions, cops prison
I help him see it clearly, I'm his life optician
Could learn from my experience but youngin' gotta live
Cause not with that mentality then something gotta give
Cause that's how we grew up, probably should of picked for boogers
Nah we was on them streets, juggin for that mugger
Still, scared that you could get killed
That fear that you feel, was that real
But I'm there like "I will not get killed"
So that fear that I feel, is not real boy
I'ma true king, tryna raise a new king
I wanna show him stuff, teach how to do things
How to ride a bike, how to tie shoe strings
How to be a man, how to treat his boo thing
Gotta have a OG, to give you that "Go 'head"
I don't blame you niggas, I blame your old head
I know all about that, my poppa wasn't down
Poppa used to come through, poppa doesn't now
Shoulda' protected me but poppa wasn't 'round
So now I got this 9, that pop-a-dozen round
Them kids grow up quick, usually grow you up too
Turn you to a big dog, that's what havin' pups do
Did a lot, but I know that I ain't done yet
Before it goes down, I make sure that my son set/sunset
You made so strong, you made this whole song
You made me Young OG, love you Johan
"One two three four five six seven eight nine"
Uhh, it's the ten crack commandments
Nigga can't tell me nothin bout this coke, uh-huh
Can't tell me nothin bout this crack, this weed
To my hustlin niggaz
Niggaz on the corner I ain't forget you niggaz
My triple beam niggaz, word up
"One two three four five six seven eight nine"
I been in this game for years, it made me a animal
It's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step by step booklet for you to get
your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule nombre uno: never let no one know
how much, dough you hold, cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
if that man fucked up, get your ass stuck up
Number two: never let em know your next move
Don't you know Bad Boys move in silence or violence
Take it from your highness 
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
Number three: never trust no-bo-dy
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodie to mask up, shit, for that fast buck
she be layin in the bushes to light that ass up
Number four: know you heard this before
Never get high, on your own supply
Number five: never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want a ounce, tell em bounce
Number six: that god credit, dead it
You think a crackhead payin you back, shit forget it
Seven: this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely seperated
Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number eight: never keep no weight on you
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jobs too
Number nine shoulda been number one to me
If you ain't gettin bags stay the fuck from police 
If niggaz think you snitchin ain't tryin listen
They be sittin in your kitchen, waitin to start hittin
Number ten: a strong word called consignment
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele say hell no
Cause they gon want they money rain sleet hail snow
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, twenty-four years, on the wake up
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup, when you pass
Your girl fucked my man Jake up, heard in three weeks
she sniffed a whole half of cake up
Heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up
Gotta go gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up, uhh
Crack king, Frank Blizzard
"One two three four five six seven eight nine"
Oh shit what's that man
I don't know kid, I think it's a party going on
Oh it's the remix
Check it, yeah muthafuckas
What we about to do right about now
We gonna get kinda funky

And I'm rolling with my man Biggie Smalls,
Mary J  Blige and J-C from Jodeci
And we about to do something new
Check it, say what, say what
Hey yo, what's the 411, hun
What's the 411, hun
I know you got it going on
Hey yo, I got it going on
As I sit back relax
Steam a blunt, sip a Becks
Think about the sexy singers that I wanna sex
I'd probably go to jail 
For fuckin Patti Labelle
Ooh Regina Belle, she'd probably do me swell
Jasmine Guy was fly
Mariah Carey, kinda scary
Wait a minute what about my honey Mary
The jeans they fittin like a glove
I had a crush on you since Real Love
Hold your horses
I'ma show ya who the boss of intercourse is
Sex, I'm takin no losses
Even groups like SWV and TLC
Can't see B-I-G with telepathy
The recipe, a picture hardcore with a gun
Pimpin ain't easy but it's always fun
When it comes to nuts, I bust'em one by one
So what's the 4-1-1 hun
Yeah nigga, what makes you better than the next nigga
Seen you last week in your black ass car, freak
You try to play like Mr all of that
But now you wanna come to me with some chit-chat
I don't have no time for no wham-bam thank you mam
Gas me up, get me drunk and hit, then you scram
The same old shit you pulled last week on Pam
I'm not having it, no I'm not having it
You got to do a lot more of this, that how it be
I'm Mary Blige and you just ain't running up in me
I need a man who's looking out for some security
So come correct with some respect, and then we'll see
So if you with it, then rock the 7-digits
And I might just give you a call Damn
If you ain't with it then don't waste your time at all
Biggie Smalls, and you don't stop
All my love dreams that I've had
And my dreams are very special
All my life I've looked for you
And you make the dream come true
You make me another you
Love like this is kind of special
Things you seem to do devine
This is ours to combine
I know our love must make a begining
Love is life and life is living
I like, the sexiest muthafucka
And I want to bust the 411
'94 is here
We gonna have something new for you on this next album, man
Yeah, we gonna have something new for your asses
We going to keep it funky
Yeah, it's a Bad Boy thing
My man Raj on the remix tip
Yeah, big shouts to the uptown crew
Ugh, to all the people in the Bronx and nation
Funk nation that is, that recorded the album
My man Busta Rhymes, my man Grand Puba, check it
Ugh, yeah, Flip Gray in the house
My man Buttnaked, Tim Dawg, ugh
19, 1970 somethin', 1970 somethin'
Nigga I don't sweat the date, my moms is late
So I had to plan my escape, out the skins
In this world, the fly girl
Tangere or Hennessy until I called Earl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck
While, Juvenile rippin' mics and shit
New York, New York ready for the lights of this
Uh, then came the worst date, May, 21st
2:19 is when my mama's water burst
No spouse in the house, so she rolls herself
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical chord's wraped around my neck
I'm seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy
The doctor looked and said "He's gonna be a Bad Boy "
1970 somethin', 1970 somethin'
Would 'Pac be alive, if you let 'Pac drive?
Swear to God, to reverse, that I'll give my Left Eye
With the right I'll visualize the king of Bed-Sty
Checkin' his daughter, Teana into junior high
If I was in Brooklyn and B I  was still alive
In 2006, it might sound like this
NY, 7-1-8's, 2-1-2's
With Sue's rendezvous, it's like Moulin Rouge
High fashion, uptown Air Force Ones and Vasquez
Puerto Ricans with fat asses
Blazed ducth masters, we dump ashes
On models in S classes for you bastards
Catch a cab to Manhattan, with that Broadway actin'
You hype, that Belly shit'll get you capped and wraped in plastic
Tell the captain to ask Rog' What's Happenin'?
I hear, nor speak no evil inside the magnum
1970 somethin', 1970 somethin'
Now I'm thirteen, smokin' blunts makin' cream
On the drug scene, fuck the football team
Risk it, rupt' your spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearin' the coach scream, made my lifetime dream
I mean, I wanna blow up, stack my dough up
So school, I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Ma' said that I should grow up, and check myself
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf, nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, king of New York, I wanna be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary
Seat 74, Mart 8 set me straight
Not able to move, behind a great steel gate
Time to contemplate,, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked, was all the money for bail
Nine, teen, seventy, somethin'
1970 somethin'
Who y'all talkin to man?
Check it out, check it out
This here goes out
to all the niggaz that be fuckin mad bitches

Lose a major part to him, arm, leg
She beggin me to stop but this cat gettin closer
Gettin hot like a toaster, I cocks the toast, uhh
Before my eyes could blink
She screams out, "Honey bring me up somethin to drink!"
He go back downstairs more time to think
Her brain racin, she's tellin me to stay patient
She don't know I'm, cool as a fan
Gat in hand, I don't wanna blast her man
But I can and I will doe, I probably chill doe
Even though situation lookin kinda ill yo
It came to me like a song I wrote
Told the bitch gimme your scarf, pillowcase and rope
Got dressed quick, tied the scarf around my face
Roped the bitch up, gagged her mouth with the pillowcase
Play the cut, nigga comin off some love potion shit
Flash the heat on em, he stood emotionless
Dropped the glass screamin, "Don't blast here's the stash,
a hundred cash just don't shoot my ass, please!"
Nigga pullin mad G's out the floor
Put stacks in a Prater knapsack, hit the door
Grab the keys to the five, call my niggaz on the cell
Bring some weed I got a story to tell, uhh

What do ya do when yo' bitch is untrue?
You cut that hooker off and find someone new
I need another bitch another bitch, in my life
I know he don't treat you like I treat you
Time to explain your game is see-through
Sex is lethal, I ain't gon' lie
Means to get ya back, I ain't gon' try
Like this y'all, my girl sucked anotha nigga dick y'all
Light skinned with the chromed out six y'all
Thought they was creepin, took trips to V-A every third weekend
While you was sleepin, he hit you on the box
Sixty-nine code non-stop
Shoulda left ya then, but my heart said not
You knew too much, the relationship grew too much
You knew about the crack vials, means to be trialed
Way I hid dough under the bathroom tile
Waited for a while, thought you was my right thing
Then things got frightening
Peep the scene, sorta like Sam Rothstein
Guess you Ginger, huh, go figure
Never thought you could be a gold digger
Take my dough and spend with the next nigga
Asked my man Trigga, my ace  coon
Told me cut the bitch off 'fore the shit balloon
Now I'm like Brandy, "Sittin in My Room"
Pissy drunk listenin to Stylistic tunes
Or the O'Jays, thinkin bout the old days
My nigga's like, "Fuck that bitch, go play
Baller, did she beep you?Don't call her
Guess who I seen, that freak bitch Paula
She was askin bout ya whereabouts
Here's the digits, I know you can wear that out
Tear that out the frame, ya game so tight
You'll be all fuckin night"
What do ya do when your man is untrue?
Do you cut the sucker off and find someone new?
I need another man, in my life
Member when you said you would die for me, shit
All of that was just lies to me
Motherfucker shoulda never said bye to me
Now you cry for me, like Jodeci
It's like that y'all, my nigga hit another bitch from the back y'all
Black nasty and mad fat y'all  shoulda seen the hoe
Nigga pack ya shit, tou out the do', ohh
What about the fight in the Mirage?
I seen ya Benz, parked outside my sister's garage
Said it was ya friend Rog, bullshit
I ain't gonna keep puttin up wit the bullshit
And still I, never sweat these bitches
who be hanged like plaques on the wall and ya pictures
Scalin fishes, my love is concrete
Stashin ya heat in the passenger seat
of the Nautica Jeep, we've been down for so long
Still a bitch like me tryin to hold on
Teary eyed, a bitch steamin
Girls steady screamin, "Kim you need to leave him!"
When I testified in court
Couldn't think straight thinkin bout the bitches I fought
over you, nigga half the shit you bought
And fuck you, movin is my last resort
You see nine outta ten niggaz, ain't shit
One outta five niggaz suck a dick
Ya mad at me, too bad she ain't as bad as me
Choulda kept the freak bitch off my canape
Now you see, ain't no pussy warm as mine
Long as mine, ain't no love as strong as this
When I sucked ya dick, it's like smokin a roach
Uhh, why go from first class to coach?
I'm on
Fuck em
With my hands grippedpraise the Lord shit
Fuck her, never knew her
Screw herdump her body, dump her body sewer
Our fatheruh-huh
What you expected from his next of kin
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin
Uhh, the lesson from the Smith and Wessun is depressin
Niggaz keep stressin, the same motherfuckin question
How many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
and my body start to shake, if I should die before I wake
With my hands grippedpraise the Lord shit
Our fatherif I should die before I wake
Fluck that
Snap a nigga shit, smash him with the fifth, watch his body lift
Shut his hottie's lips, bitch screamin, hit her body quick
Got me like the trifest not knowin how my life is
My life is, rap sheet long as the Turnpike
The sheistest, hey fella, who bidded with the lifers
Did it with the glocks, spit it witcha pops, you was in diapers
Loved me when you came to Rikers
Hated me all in the free cypher  mad you can't be like us
Some murderers who turn bikers -- see Biggie Smalls
recruited these snipers -- alumni do it just like us
Some pied pipers, squeezin life out y'all
It's all out war, be all wild as all outdoor
If a coward got beef, y'all be checkin his palm
Paralyzin my niggaz thorough kid, how bout yours?
Real quick to screw a nigga then, hop out four
Clean the wipers, hit the party up and, hop out yours
Bitch niggawhoah
Yo when you fuckin wit Mac, you fuckin wit the best
Still wall to wall with them dusty Tecs
Man you know how I handle my shit, S K  can on my shit
Jump out of vans like Hannibal Smith
Man I spit a thousand rounds, your squad don't need it
Shredders in a riot pump leave you quadriplegic
When I squeeze don't breathe keep it lined and even
So when niggaz get hit, they be cryin screamin
Lyin bleedin from that iron steamin
And I ain't tryin to hear that bullshit, I ain't mean it
Niggaz start bitchin, when that pistol in they face
or I sick two puts to come and get you in your place
If I catch you in my shit, I'm wakin my bitch
Hear take this shit, crackin the brick, facin that shit
Takin two sniffs, grabbin my shit
Best believe if I get hit, y'all niggaz takin some shit
Picture niggaz takin my shit
Niggaz never thought they'd see Cube and Biggie
in the year 2000, all drunk and pissy
off whiskey, you can miss me, actin gay
He's the King of New York, I'm the King of L A 
Doin it the O G  way  it's sorta like
the Brooklyn Way, it's just the crook in me
So this is dedicated to the memory of
the Notorious One, the glorious one
And if you go for your gun, I got to go for mine
Cock my nine, and seperate yo' head from yo' spine
So, "Grab yo' dicks if you love hip-hop" and
fuck you niggaz that shot Big Pop'
The conspiracy, of this nation, for assassination
of the young black male in this black hell
And I can tell, no matter the weather

Fuck all yall bitches
Bad Boy Bitch we still here
Ihih, ih it has been
It has been, it has been, it has been
It has been said, that there has been known to be bloodshed
Over bread, men who have bled to death, dead what?
Strapped to beds, pipe bombs, dynamite, lead
Money power respect, street cred, yeah
It's scary ain't it? Picture yourself goin out as a hero uhh
Picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
Fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners
Notorious tried to warn us
We watched, so many Biggie backed off of ha ha ha
Biggie's back and 'Pac's, landmarks, history in rap
Statistically in fact  it's so sad to see us re-enact
these tragic events, which lead us back
To where we left off on March 9th
To come from such hard knock lifes
And make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights
And, once they're on us this is our lives
Thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
to see who can last the longest
And he who lasts the longest, must be the strongest uh-huh
In this concrete jungle, where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
It's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starvin
Or it could just be somebody's horror, that just horri-fies
And applies to his persona or the sizes
in his entou-rage, that intimidates the people
To the point that you know that he's gangster
He ain't just say shit, you just believe it
Since B I B  taught us niggaz to think big
I'm been about my business since then, so anxious what?
It ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for Brooklyn
This I took in, sent chills through my skin
Vicious, I'm experiencin the same sights as him
It's what excited Obie to write these poems
Rollin, goin through the same shit he spoken
Open up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies
When _Ready to Die_ was a sick part of my life yeah
Palmin that forty-five, plottin to pop my mind
Then that crooked eye Jamaican I'd so many times rewind
Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
Get up out the system, who could give him better signs
No pop of mine could top Big Poppa rhymes
So possibly I'd be popular huh? uh-huh
That's the inspiration I got from my nigga B I 
I took him from coal to diamond, I molded his mind
Enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
I made a Frankenstein, my design impressed
Backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
Critics lashed, said I made a fortune off of his passin what?
All I did was build a dynasty, off of his passion
And I'm addressin the adolesencents absent to who he is
The original king of New York, Christopher Wallace 
This is a promise on Diddy's honor, I'm a father T'Yanna
And teach her that with all the drama don't even bother 
On repeat, all of your albums play back to back yeah
And I visit your grave cause our friendship's intact
An immaculate concept, extravagant progress
Bullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yellin "God bless"
Regardless to critics yellin that East/West
I seen the game losin, I'm just pressin the reset uhh
And when the ressurection of you shines through an individual
Lyrical enough to wear the same crown of thorns literally!
I'ma pay homage, Brooklyn's finest
Whether it's Queens or Harlem it'll be instant stardom, nigga!
Talk about these hoes Big
I got a bitch that suck my dick til I nut
Spit it on my gut and slurp that shit back up

Bitch fuck a first date

My nigga ill's holdin it down for the beam
Like BIG said, we do the real things, we still bubble and steal chains
Still tustle, still struggle, we feel pain
Still ride, still die for BIG's name
For BIG I grip the cig, put six in your wig
Not cause of what he said, cause of what he did
When I hear that pop quiz, that's the way I was raised and thats the way it is for
We roll like the Panthers, show our guns on camera
Do jokes with police scanners, niggaz mediocre, full of dirt like hampers
I roll with a bunch of niggaz that wear bandanas and rep 
We kept it thurough, from the heart ripped the barrel
B K  style, see BIG howl, now
Lets see who, wanna go against Mafia world
Niggaz nuthin but squirels, they know we rep 
Niggaz tryin to get a nut, hit in the head or below the gut

The back of the club, mackin hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question askin, blunt passin, music blastin

Sleep with, keep the ep a secret why not
Why blow up my spot cause we both got hot
Now check it, I got more Mack than Craig and in the bed

No need to be greedy I got mad friends with Benz's
C-notes by the layers, true fuckin players
Jump in the Rover and come over

"I love it when you call me big pop-pa"
Throw your hands in the air, if youse a true player

If you got a gun up in your waist please don't shoot up the place why?
Cause I see some ladies tonight who should be havin my baby  bay-bee

Most of these niggaz think they be mackin but they be actin
Who they attractin with that line, "What's your name what's your sign?"
Soon as he buy that wine I just creep up from behind
And ask what your interests are, who you be with
Things to make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while, I'm gon' go call my crew
You go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around two
Plans to leave, throw the keys to Lil Cease
Pull the truck up, front, and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly go fill my belly
A t-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, cause in a few, we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right boo truuuueee
Forget the telly we just go to the crib
and watch a movie in the jacuzzi smoke l's while you do me
How ya livin Biggie Smalls? In mansion and Benz's
Givin ends to my friends and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream, fuck a dollar and a dream
Still tote gats strapped with infrared beams
Choppin o's, smokin lye an' Optimo's
Money hoes and clothes all a nigga knows
A foolish pleasure, whatever
I had to find the buried treasure, so grams I had to measure
However living better now, Coogi sweater now

Slim Thugga!
I roll straped glock 40 in my lap
I rap but still think like I'm grinding in the trap
Trying to adapt to the change from the streets to the game
Can't be selling CD's and still selling dem thangs
Cause snitches drop names and bring alot of problems
And putting somthing in they head the only way you gonna solve em'
Jackas stay plotting watching your every move
And the minute you snooze will be the minute you lose, dude
Thats the rules so I cruise with the tools
To fix the fools that think I'm slipping with my jewels
Breakin old habits so hard to do
Thats why you see me on the same block with the same crew
And everybody sitting fat living good
And I'm the only nigga that be rapping in my hood
I was raised by the hustlas, and ganged by the G's
And taught by the bosses how to stack that cheese
You got rich and G shit is still a part of you
Cause breakin old habits so hard to do
You still watch for the haters and the robbing crew
Cause breakin old habits so hard to do
When on shot that nigga like I started to
Cause breakin old habits so hard to do
Fresh out the dealership crackin open cigars in the coupe
Man cause breakin old habits so hard to do
Damn it feel good to see people up on it
Flipped two keys in two weeks and didn't flaunt it
My brain is haunted, with mean dreams
GS's with BB's on it, supreme schemes, to get Richer
than Richie, quickly, niggaz wanna hit me
If they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani, check it
My lyrical carjack, make your brains splat
High caliber gats is all I fuck with, now peep the rough shit
in my circumfrence, mad bitches, with mad lucci
Bulletproof vestes under they coochie
Spittin my uzi, don't lose me, my trigga niggas represent
Drivin dirty in J-30's gettin bent
And to my hit hoes, my murder mommies
I be smokin trees in Belize when they find me
While you still killin niggas with punany, like Connie
and Cyrus up in Cypress fuck you raw, you on the floor with the virus
While I just, slang coke, smoke pounds to choke
Got lawyers watchin lawyers so I won't go broke, now check it
Them country niggaz call me Frank White
I'm squirtin off in my loft of course I know my shit's tight
Sunrise open my eyes no surprise
Got my shorty flying in with keys taped to her thighs
With all the utensils, who hang my china thing
She half black half oriental eighty-six she got me rentals
I used to drive a Chevy Monte-Carlo, bricks of blow all in it
I was taught to sell the shit, you put your nose all in it
Let my bitch drive the Benz but the Rolls off limits
How you call yourself pimpin, with hos all in your buisness
What it is, the music business or the streets make a decision
I do this in my sleep, and you way out your division pimp
This game we play for keeps, and the rules remain hidden
This ain't a place for lames and that snitching shit is forbidden
After sitting in the kitchen and whipping with hopes of getting back
All that off a brick to go blow it, so it even 50 stacks
And now I'm sitting back, thinking about a time
When a nigga get a 100 g's, think he went down
But now look for loyalty in the game, it ain't there
And things ain't the same they changed it ain't fair
Real niggas dead, doing their time and ain't here
You commit the same crime and come home the same year
First things first, I poppa, freaks all the honies
Dummies, Playboy bunnies, those wantin money
Those the ones I like cause they don't get nathan
but penetration, unless it smells like sanitation
Gar-bage, I turn like doorknobs
Heartthrob, never, black and ugly as ever
However, I stay Coogi down to the socks
Rings and watch filled with rocks
And my jam knock in your Mitsubishi
Girls pee pee when they see me
Navajos creep me in they tee pee
As I lay down laws like I lay carpet
Stop itif you think they gonna make a prophet
Don't see my ones, gon' see my gunsget it
Now tell ya friends Poppa hit it then split it
in two as I flow with the Junior M A F I A 
I don't know what the hell's stoppin ya
I'm clockin ya, Versace shades watchin ya
Once ya grin, I'm ingame begin
First I talk about how I dresses this
In diamond necklassesstretch Lexuses
The sex is just immaculate from the back I get
Deeper and deeper, help ya reach the
climax that your man can't make
Call him, tell him you'll be home real late
and sing the break
One more chance
Biggie give me one more chance
She's sick of that song on how it's so long
Thought he worked his until I handled my biz
There I is  Major Payne like Damon Wayans
Low Down Dirty even like his brother Keenan
Schemin, don't leave ya girl round me
True player for real, ask Puff Daddy
You ringin bells with bags from Chanel
Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel
Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell
She beeped me, meet me at twelve
Where you at?Flippin jobs, payin car notes?
While I'm swimmin in ya women like the breast stroke
Right stroke, left stroke was the best stroke
Death stroketongue all down her throat
Nuttin left to do but send her home to you
I'm throughcan ya sing the song for me, boo?
So, what's it gonna be?Him or me?
We can cruise the world with pearls, gator boots for girls
The envy of all women, crushed linen
Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in 'em
The finest women I love with a passion
Ya man's a wimp, I give that ass a good thrashin
High fashionflyin into all states
Sexin me while ya man masturbates
Isn't this great?Your flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
I'm not only the client, I'm the player president
Remember back in the days, when niggaz had waves
Gazelle shades, and corn braids
Pitchin pennies, honies had the high top jellies
Shootin skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly
Loungin at the barbeques, drinkin brews
with the neighborhood crews, hangin on the avenues
Turn your pagers, to nineteen ninety three
Niggaz is gettin smoked G, believe me
Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick
Cause real street niggaz ain't havin that shit
Totin techs for rep, smokin blunts in the project
hallways, shootin dice all day
Wait for niggaz to step up on some fightin shit
We get hype and shit and start lifin shit
So step away with your fist fight ways
Motherfucker this ain't back in the days, but you don't hear me though
No more cocoa leave-io, one two three
One two three, all of this to me, is a mystery
I hear you motherfuckers talk about it
But I stay seein bodies with the motherfuckin chalk around it
And I'm down with the shit too
For the stupid motherfuckers wanna try to use Kung-Fu
Instead of a Mac-10 he tried scrappin
Slugs in his back and, that's what the fucks happenin
when you sleep on the street
Little motherfuckers with heat, want ta leave a nigga six feet deep
And we comin to the wake
To make sure the cryin and commotion ain't a motherfuckin fake
Back in the days, our parents used to take care of us
Look at em now, they even fuckin scared of us
Callin the city for help because they can't maintain
Damn, shit done changed
If I wasn't in the rap game
I'd probably have a key knee deep in the crack game
Because the streets is a short stop
Either you're slingin crack rock or you got a wicked jumpshot
Shit, it's hard being young from the slums
eatin five cent gums not knowin where your meals comin from
And now the shit's gettin crazier and major
Kids younger than me, they got the Sky grand Pagers
Goin outta town, blowin up
Six months later all the dead bodies showin up
It make me wanna grab the nine and the shottie
But I gotta go identify the body
Damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts?
Everytime I turn around a nigga gettin took out
Shit, my momma got cancer in her breast
Don't ask me why I'm motherfuckin stressed, things done changed
Nigga was motherfuckin HYPED UP
Nigga just grabbed the nigga, snuffed the nigga
and it was on from there
The motherfucker there wasn't nuttin stoppin him
What what did the rest of his niggaz do?
Man the motherfuckers was just ready for anything
Them niggaz was packin burners
Them niggaz was ready to fight
whatever we had to do holmes
Niggaz was on the real flipout holmes
It was just comin out like a motherfucker
The nigga amped be like COME ON, COME ON MOTHERFUCKER!!
Come on motherfuckers, come on
"Man what you fuck doin over here?"
"Are you awake now?"
"Hell yah I'm awake man 
now tell me what the fuck is goin on here"
"Looks like the competition stopped by
to pay us a little visit, and check us out"
Let's go deep into the phrase, beautiful sunrays
off the baldhead, everything is real
Biggie me put on this joint so I'ma be the big wheel
Watch it Slim, hey Dad, place yo' bet on seven
Peace to one-oh-six, one-oh-eight, one-to-the-hundred-eleventh
Hey Biggie, I understand you're from Brooklyn
with 22's in your shoes, yo keep the shank ready
Uhhh well, why not blow up the spot with Sadat
Release the BRAINSTORM, to make your motherfuckin BRAIN WARM
A strange form, somethin kind of lyrical
Biggie the bastard, Sadat's kind of spiritual
Well "In God We Trust", guns I bust
Got that disgustin, sewer style dumpin
and that uhh do you knowwwwww, where you're goin to
Do you like the things that I bring?
Make an emcee wanna sing for a livin
Take the beatdown we fuckin givin, c'mon motherfucker
What?Niggaz want drama, puttin work on my block
when I told y'all last week, that shit was too hot
Sellin pieces and treys, cuts my dimes
Somebody gon' get paid, somebody block get sprayed
Reaction is delayed as y'all run down the block
Caught one in your chest, your breath come in spurts
Hey yo Biggie tell these niggaz I'ma hit em where it hurts
The big city it don't spare no bodies
Call me papichulo, to all the spanish mamis
I'm about ten blunts down, drank three or fo' stouts
Seen five fat asses, passed this bitch with glasses
Hey yo money that's yo' stock, yo Bigs pass the glock
I'ma tell him it can happen, don't play me with that rap shit
Life is real, so Biggie take the steel
I got seven Mac-11's, about eight,  38's
Nine 9's, ten Mac-10's, the shits never end
You can't touch my riches
Even if you had MC Hammer and them 357 bitches
Biggie Smalls, the millionaire, the mansion, the yacht
The two weed spots, the two hot glocks
HAH, that's how I got the weed spot
I shot dread in the head, took the bread and the landspread
Lil' Gotti got the shotty to your body
So don't resist, or you might miss Christmas
I tote guns, I make number runs
I give emcees the runs drippin 
when I throw my clip in the A K , I slay from far away
Everybody hit the D-E-C-K
My slow flows remarkable
Peace to Matteo
Now we smoke weed like Tony Montana sniff the llello
That's crazy blunts, mad L's
My voice excels from the avenue to jailcells
Oh my God I'm droppin shit like a pigeon
I hope you're listenin, smackin babies at they christening
So you better grab your pistol
cause if you sit still, I'm gonna make your fuckin shit spill
And I'm talkin bout buckets, why did I have to do it?
Sadat said fuck it, you got a gun, nigga bust it
Cause I got mo' shots to pop-ya
Big Pop-pa, breakin you off somethin proper
Signin off is the hardcore rap singer

Money-hungriest, Brooklyn Loch Ness
Nine millimeter cock test, wan fi' test?
And the winner is
Y'all niggaz know the rules

In the heat of battle it's no rest for the weary
Snooze and you lose is the theory
The theory of a patient man, is wild beyond belief
Be afraid, you don't want beef with us chief
Your talk is cheap and the supply meets demand

Uh, representing, Biggie Smalls in the house, uh, check it, uh

Niggas say I'm pussy, I dare you to stick your dick in this
If I was pussy I'd be filled with syphilis
Herpes, gonorrhea, climittia, getting rid'a ya
Got it locked like the penatentury
Niggas mention me for MC execution
Who you choosin, the wack MC
Or the fat black MC
Jack Dempsey will start shaking
All it's taking, is some marijuana and I'm making
MCs break fast, like flap-jacks and bacon
Back spins, the windmills, who's still the gin-drinker
Ill-thinker, exploding when the paper hits the ink-ugh
Take the Gangster Chronicles, turn to page 6-6-6
Holocost, B I G  the merciless
Niggas press they luck-and
They get a butt-fuckin
Straight up the ass
Raw dog with the rash
And I don't fuck with the condoms
The condoms is a problem from the AIDS getting sprayed
Diseases, B I G  pleases
MCs across the seas is just the way, I crush my pray, hey
I'm crazy and deranged
Blowing niggas out the frame, simple and plain
But getting back, to the black rhinoceros of rap
B I G  took a loss, how preposterous is that, nigga
Recognize
Notorious Biggie Smalls, '94 Ready To Die
Fuck the bitches, fuck all the stank-ass hoes, all my niggas know

That's why I get my nut and I be out the fuckin do'
You know they might be the one to set me up
Wanna get they little brother to wet me up
That's why I tote Tecs and stuff to get 'em off my case
Just in case the little fucker ends up misplaced
I don't give a bitch enough, to catch the bus
and when I see the semen I'm leavin
Bitches be schemin, I kid ya not
That's why I keep my windows locked and my Glock cocked
One hoe said, "Big, why you so hard on us?
Why you swear all bitches are so scandalous?"
Thug nigga 'til the end, tell a friend bitch
Cause when I like ya, then ya go and fuck my friend bitch
And you know that ain't right
You know that ain't right
With a friend of mine
You see, I don't sweat these hoes
I keep 'em in flavors like Timbos and Girbauds
Bitches just like to play the merry-go
Yeah we know, drop the scenario
It was me, Dee, the MPV
The blunts and brew thang, knockin' some Wu-tang
M-E-T-H-Oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch
Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit
Light the blunt clip, and recognize a pimp
Needless to speak, the Gee's obsolete
Don't sleep!Banged the skins in a week
On the creep up the avenue
I seen her on the block, who she rappin' to?
That's my nigga Dee, he got Gee
Now she fuckin him and fuckin me, see
You know that ain't right
Uh now I play her far like a moon play a star
She still sweat me hard 'cause I'm a rap star
I be cruisin up the block, I be passin her
Pimpin hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, schemin on a gang-bang
She should've used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's sayin I dissed her 'cause I'm fuckin her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets 'em pissed, uh
But she started that fuckin family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me? True
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you
So break the fuck out like a rash
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit yo' nasty ass
against the wall, and Biggie grunting
Woman moaning, uh, yeah, uh, oooh, oh yeah, mmm, yeah

Uhh, uhh, what?
Some say the x, make the sex
Spec-tacular, make me lick you from yo neck
To yo back, then ya, shiverin, tongue deliverin
Chills up that spine, that ass is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
If its alright with you, we fuckin that's alright
Deja vu, the blunts sparked, finger fuckin in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between yo legs
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to yo mother's bed
At the Mariott, we be lucky if we find a spot
Next to yo sister, I really missed the
way she used to rub my back, when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when yo ass would wiggle
Now I know you used to suites at the Parker Meridian
Trips to the Carribean, but tonight, no ends
Girl you look fine, like a windface Rolex, you just shine
I like that waistline
Let me hit that from behind, which wall you wanna climb
My styles genuine, girl I love you long time
I got you pinned up, with yo fuckin limbs up
All because you like the way my Benz was rimmed up
Bitch keep yo shin up, please watch me do thee
Nasty, like it when you make it move fast mommy
I like it when you tro' it pon me
No love makin, strictly back breakin
Ceas' know, all his hoes, go to my door
Then they go to his flo', to fuck some more
So no, caviar, sharp bar, uh uh
Strictly sex that's pretty and left over spaghetti
I know you used to slow CD's and Don P's
But tonight its eight tracks and six-packs while I hit that
Lets stop the bullshit baby
Let me take you to the stop, get you hot
So you wanna be with me, Puff Daddy
B I G , bring that ass to me
So you wanna be hardcore 
With your hat to the back, talkin bout the gats in your raps 
But I can't feel that hardcore appeal 
that you're screamin, baby I'm dreamin 
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some
MC's got to feel one, caps I got to peel some 
To let niggaz know that if you fuck with Big-and-Heavy 
I get up in that ass like a wedgie
Says who? Says me, the lyrical 
Niggaz sayin, "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle" 
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me 
Just for niggaz actin shifty 
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker 
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor 
Smokin funk by the boxes, packin glocks is 
natural to eat you niggaz like chocolates 
The funk baby 
"I live for the funk, I'll die for the funk" LOTUG, Chief Rocka 
All I want is bitches, big booty bitches 
Used to sell crack, so I could stack my riches 
Now I pack gats, to stop all the snitches 
from stayin in my business, what is this?Relentless 
approach, to know if I'm broke or not 
Just cause I joke and smoke a lot 
Don't mean I don't tote the glock 
Sixteen shots for my niggaz in the pen 
Until we motherfuckin meet again 
Huh, I'm doin rhymes now, fuck the crimes now 
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now 
Cause I'm knee deep in the beats 
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the Mac-10 by the seats 
For the jackers, the jealous ass crackers in the car sirens 
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof 
Hold ya head, cause when you hit the bricks 
I got gin, mad blunts, and bitches suckin dick 
The funk baby 
So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side 
How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside 
Bed-Stuy, the place where my head rests 
Fifty shot clip if a nigga wan' test 
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya 
High as a motherfuckin helicopter 
That's why I pack a nina, fuck a misdeameanor 
Beatin motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina 
when I'm rippin all through your whole crew 
Strapped like bamboo, but I don't sling guns 
I got bags of funk, and it's sellin by the tons 
Niggaz wanna know, how I live the mack life 
Making money smoking mics like crack pipes
It's type simple and plain to maintain 
I add a little funk to the brain 
The funk baby 
To my motherfuckin man 50 Grand, the alcoholic man
Inject a tall can in his bloodstream if he can
Biggie Smalls, the pussy stroker
MC provoker, chocolate thai smoker HEAR??
I like to max in Maximas and Acuras
Your girl buttcheeks I'm smackin HER
The raw rapper, spine snapper
with the little hookers on my lap-ah
You know the flavor Mack-ah
A shy nigga but I ain't your fuckin comforter
And if I ever fall in love I bet I'm fuckin her
Ask the hooker, if I didn't jook her
If she tried to front, then I drop the Chucky Booker on her
 Why you wannaplay your games on me
Bitch, you crazy?
Commitments, I'm Swayze, no time for the ill shit
Rest with the niggaz on that real bloodspill shit
My rap-pin tac-tics are drastic
Stretchin motherfuckers like Mr  Fantastic
So if you wanna see my pedigreeeee
You better be, filled with energy, niggaz never gettin me
So let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down

Odds even, said shoot blaow
Asked me the reason, and I said loot
Man that's all I'm here for, therefore
when death declares war, you know what to prepare for
Shit, one for shelter, book flights on Delta
Live on your station, the radiation'll melt ya
CoolI guess your momma raised a fool
You didn't wanna blaze your tool shoulda stayed in school
Rap terror, shots through your new era
Get it together, y'all niggaz shoulda knew better
I'm on point like acupuncture
I might, track and hunt ya, smack and punch ya
Left side, right side, witcha hoe I might slide
Runnin wit this big guy, y'all niggaz is pranksters
Don't make a nigga have to show you the pound
and show you the sound, that'll put you low in the ground
Just let me get down
Let me get down, let me get down, let me get down, let me get down

Motherfuckers better know huh, huh
Lock your windows, close your doors
Biggie Smalls, huh yeah
"I'm a bad, bad, boy"
My man Inf left a Tec and a nine at my crib 
Turned himself in, he had to do a bid 
A one-to-three, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G, you with me? 
Motherfucking right, my pocket's looking kind of tight 
and I'm stressed, yo Biggie let me get the vest 
No need for that, just grab the fucking gat 
The first pocket that's fat the Tec is to his back 
Word is bond, I'm a smoke him yo don't fake no moves what?
Treat it like boxing: stick and move, stick and move 
Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit 
I've been robbin motherfuckers since the slave ships 
with the same clip and the same four-five 
Two point-blank, a motherfucker's sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogart 
have his mother singing "It's so hard "
Yes Love, love your fucking attitude
because the nigga play pussy that's the nigga that's getting screwed 
and bruised up from the pistol whipping 
welts on the neck from the necklace stripping
Then I'm dipping up the block and I'm robbing bitches too 
up the herring bones and bamboos 
I wouldn't give fuck if you're pregnant 
Give me the baby rings and a #1 MOM pendant 
I'm slamming niggaz like Shaquille, shit is real 
When it's time to eat a meal I rob and steal 
cause Mom Duke ain't giving me shit 
so for the bread and butter I leave niggaz in the gutter 
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous 
Crazier than a bag of fucking Angel Dust 
When I bust my gat motherfuckers take dirt naps 
I'm all that and a dime sack, where the paper at?
"But he's sticking you, and taking all of your money"
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot 
"I'm a bad, bad, boy"
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up 
and I'm shooting niggaz quick if you hiccup 
Don't let me fill my clip up in your back and head piece 
The opposite of peace sending Mom Duke a wreath 
You're talking to the robbery expert 
Stepping to your wake with your blood on my shirt 
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant 
cause when I lick shots the shits is persistent 
Huh, goodness gracious the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
Nigga, pass that before you get your grave dug
from the main thug,  357 slug
And my nigga Biggie got an itchy one grip 
One in the chamber, 32 in the clip 
Motherfuckers better strip, yeah nigga peel 
before you find out how blue steel feel 
from the Beretta, putting all the holes in your sweater 
The money getter motherfuckers don't have better 
Rolex watches and colourful Swatches 
I'm digging in pockets, motherfuckers can't stop it 
Man, niggaz come through I'm taking high school rings too 
Bitches getfor they earrings and bangles
and when I rock her and drop her I'm taking her door knockers 
And if she's resistant "baka! baka! baka!"
So go get your man bitch he can get robbed too 
Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?
I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it
and if I set it the cocksucker won't forget it
"But he's sticking you, and taking all of your money"
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot 
"I'm a bad, bad, boy"
Man, listen all this walking is hurting my feet 
But money looks sweet where at? in the Isuzu jeep 
Man, I throw him in the Beem, you grab the fucking C R E A M 
and if he start to scream "bam! bam!", have a nice dream 
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car 
Fur coats and diamonds, she thinks she a superstar 
Ooh Biggie, let me jack her, I kick her in the back 
Hit her with the gat 
Yo chill, Shorty, let me do that
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block 
The bitch act shocked, gettin shot on the spot 
Oh shit! The cops! Be cool, fool 
They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts 
So why the fuck he keep lookin? I guess to get his life tooken
I just came home, ain't trying to see Central Booking 
Oh shit, now he lookin in my face 
You better haul ass cause I ain't with no fucking chase 
So lace up your boots, cause I'm about to shoot 
A true motherfucker going out for the loot 
I'm sittin in the crib dreamin about Leer jets and coupes
The way Salt shoops and how they sell records like Snoop
I'm interrupted by a doorbell
3:52, who the hell
Is this?
I gets up quick
Cocks my shit
Stop the dogs from barkin
Then proceed to walkin
Its a face that I seen before
My nigga Sing, we used to sling on the 16th floor
Check it
I look deeper
I see blood up on his sneakers
And his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth
So I dip
Nigga, is you creepin or speakin?
He tells me C-Rock just got hit up at the beacon
I opens up the door, pitiful
Is he in critical?
Retaliation for this one won't be minimal
Cuz I'm a criminal
Way before the rap shit
Bust the gat shit
Puff won't even know what happened,
If it's done smoothly
Silencers on the Uzi
Stash in the hooptie
My alibi, any cutie
With a booty that done fuck Big Pop
Head spinnin, reminiscin bout my man C-Rock
Somebody's got ta die
If I got, you got ta go
Somebody's got to die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody's got to die
Nobody got ta know
That I killed yo ass in the mist, kid
Fillin clips he explained our situation
Precisely, so we know exactly what we facin
Some kid named Jason
In a Honda station wagon
Was braggin
About how much loot and crack he stackin
Rock had a grip so they formed up a clique
Small crew
'Round the time I was locked up with you
True indeed
But yo nigga let me proceed
Don't fill them clips too high
Give them bullets room to breathe
Damn where was I?
One night in town
Blew the fuck up
D-Rock went home
And Jay got stuck the fuck up
Hit 'em twice
Got 'em right for the virgin white
Pistol whipped his kids
And taped up his wife
He said "Yo Rock, set em up", no question
Wet em up no less 
Than 50 shots in his direction
How many shots?
Man nigga, I seen mad holes
What kinda gats?
Hitch links, Cocks, and Calicoles
But fuck that
I know where all them niggas rest at
In the buildin hustlin
And they don't be strapped
Supreme in black
Is downstairs, the engine runnin
Find a bag to put the guns in
And c'mon if yo comin
Exchanged hugs and pounds before the throw down
How its gonna go down
Lay these niggas low-down
Slow down
Fuck all that plannin shit
Run up in they cribs
And make em catch the man n shit
See niggas like you do ten year bids
Miss the niggas they want
And murder innocent kids
Not I
One niggas in my eye
That's Jason
Ain't no slugs gonna be wasted
Revenge I'm tastin at the tip of my lips
I can't wait to feel my clip in his hips
Pass the chocolate
Sing ain't lie
There's Jason with his back to me
Talkin to his faculty
I start to get a funny feelins
Put the mask on in case his niggas start squealin
Scream his name out
Squeeze six knuckles shorter
Nigga turned around holdin his daughter
Chill Twan, man!
That nigga Big got somethin to say?
Yo Big, what'chu got to say Big?

Blunt, I take a toke, but only if it's weed
Skunk with no seeds, a sip of Hennessy
Pass to D, or maybe movin solo
Never with a skeezer by my side, that's a no-no
Tell me I ain't the flyest nigga that you ever saw
Live in action, guaranteed RAW!
"Who's coming through? Y'all know who!"
Bed-Stuy Brooklyn where this rapper was originated
Your rhymes ain't shit  they must be constipated
Many awaited, the heavyset brother from Fulton Street
to drop a rhyme to a funky beat
Expellin MC's as if I was at Sarah J
Or boys and girls at any school around the way
Opponents, pupils, but I'm the principal
Hard to beat, near invincible
Niggaz wanna know, how I live the mack life
Makin money smokin mics like crack pipes
Flippin bombs, stayin calm, givin my people my palm
and sayin rhymes to set off the alarm!
Yes it's me, the B I G 
Competition ripper ever since 13
Used to steal clothes was considered a thief
Until I started hustlin on Fulton Street
Makin loot, knockin boots on the regular
Pass the microphone I'm the perfect competitor
Jewels and all that, my clothes is all that
Chumps steppin to me, that's where they took a FALL at!

I stay close to mine like Tina on Turner
Quick to smother, a punk motherfucker
Undercover, word to mother, I'm above ya

A crazy crab, you might make my dick itch

Even my mother, be noddin her head to this
Makes her proud to see her one son get loud
Flip on a sucker, and bow to the crowd
Drink a little Hennessy, smoke a blunt or 2 or 3 or 4
Live in action, guaranteed RAW
Round two the rhyme regulator here to roast ya
As ya follow this yeah, I gave a toast to ya crew
See, they popped on ya like a kernel
You didn't realize that the beef was eternal
Internal injury that's what you're soon to see
B I G  keep company
Sometimes in my waist, if they come opponent
Run upstairs, change my skimmer and my coat and
I'm floatin, to your punk part of town
Anybody frontin, they better duck down
Don't get mad cause I grazed ya
You jumped in that 4-door Blazer, quick I couldn't get a good hit
Shit, I was aimin for the melon
But the kick of my three-pound auto there's no tellin
Drink a little Hennessy, smoke a blunt or 2 or 3 or 4
Live in action, guaranteed RAW

A Big Pun and B I G  collabo
That shit would've been incredible
Aye yaknahmsayin, it was just happen
We have our day, you know?
I seen him, I seen him, I seen him at the pearly gates, yaknahmean?
We keep it, keep it, keep it going from there
Uhh, I dream filthy
My moms and pops mixed me with Jamaican Rum and Whiskey
Huh, what a set up
Shoulda pushed 'em dead off, wipe the sweat off
Uhh, cause in this world I'm dead off, squeeze lead off
Benz sped off, ain't no shook hands in Brook-land
Army fatigue break up teams, the enemies
Look man, you wanna see me locked up, shot up
Moms crotched up over the casket, screamin BASTARD
Cryin, know my friends is lyin
Y'all know who killed 'em filled 'em with the lugars from they Rugers
or they Desert, dyin ain't the shit but it's pleasant
Kinda quiet, watch my niggaz bring the riot
Giving cats the opposite of diets
You gain thirty pounds when you die no lie, lazy eye
I was high when they hit me, took a few cats with me
Shit, I need the company 
Apoligies in order, to T'Yanna my daughter
If it was up to me you would be with me, sorta like
Daddy Dearest, my vision be the clearest
Silencers so you can't hear it
Competition still fear it, shit don't ask me
I went from ashy to nasty to classy, and still
Nigga still gotta get his grind on
Come get introduced to my home
I grew up in the crime zone
Soon as you grown, you on your own, you keep your strap
You keep your chrome cause the streets is chilly
Now get your grind on
Come get introduced to my home
A nigga grew up in the pro-jects, end up gettin mo' stressed
Mo' money, mo' drama you know a nigga keep his armor
Cause the streets are killin
Now get your grind on
Come get introduced to my home
The penalty is death, especially when I'm mentally stressed
My enemies hang with me 'til I eventually flip
I never reject an offer to battle
Slap a coffin on the saddle
and rattle like a wooden horse to el barrio
Niggaz talk but they babble cause they ain't sayin nuttin
If ain't blazin somethin with the mac I'm in the shack bakin muffins
Fake the funk and get your rump roast
One dose of the toast'll make you jump if you come close
Pun spoke, ain't no more debatin  my Squad been waitin
for the perfect time to give you what you all been waitin
An orgi-nation of veterans built
with genuine skills to pay the heat, gas, and the rest of the bills
Invest in the real, don't get left in the hills
My tech and my steel turn your whole crew into vega-ta-bills
We blessed with the will to never surrender
cause my every agenda's in and out, unseen like I entered the ninja

On that I 9-5 swirvin to a town near you
My niggaz watch out for that Black Surburbans
And no it's not the Feds, man papi's home
And papi got it good, he could put you on
Listen, I done made abandoned blocks look hot
Nine to ten Benzes, a couple of drops
Couple of rubber bands from the corrupt cops
Just to see my niggaz eat and shit and huggin the blocks
Crack a chestize 'em, right besides 'em
In front of a hundred million viewers, shouldn't surprise 'em
We from the Bronx where the may-ors lift up
And niggaz get shot in broad day cause we don't give a 
Fuck little niggaz on bike and just shoot you
All for a pair of some Nikes, the shits brutal
I done seen fiends O D , shot the wrong pack
Then they call the shit the bomb smack
Word to Crack, the god body, the hard body, the realest ever
The John Gotti, this rap shit, will it kill me? Never
This goes out to cats, fingers in they ass again
Fifty dollar half-a-men, daydreamin
Fuck around get wet like semen, your whole team-and
be Mor-gan than Freeman
I took the cream and, moved to new places new faces
Fuck the screwfaces, cause when I flip
I make the papers, dangerous, we Goodfellas
Niggaz can't bang with us, try to do me
My crew be unruly what
To old school cats that call gats toolies
Call blacks moolies, think it's cool to smoke woolies
And fuck without rubbers what specialize
in killin wives and grandmothers, who ya trustin, shit
When Frank start bustin, Frank start somethin
Killin ya gently, God meant me, to push a Bentley
Me and Sean Combs takin broads home
On the phone with the chip,with these Cristal chicks
Bout to make our own porno flicks, my life's the shit
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit' the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
I swear to God I just want to slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddah head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't,
I can't believe suicide's on my fuckin' mind
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
Woman hold her head and cry
Cause her son had been shot down in the street and died
I reach my peak, I can't speak,
call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak
I'm sick of niggaz lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin'
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin' 
Check the pain I inflict, like a convict, the Fulton digger
Jump in the Acura Vigor, after I stick ya
Rip ya like a razor, straight up Henny with no chaser
Watch me erase ya, misplace ya
Put you in the back with the derelicts
Yeah, I pop plenty shit
Chump, I'm making hits
No time for the crack rock and shit
Took it to another level
Now I'm getting crazy papes, getting paid from the devils
Another amateur trying to damage the pedigree
Of the B-I-G-G-I-E, you know it's me
Hoes I thought you know I'm smooth as a babies ass
Smooth as Teeddy Pendegrass, smoke the grass, get in your ass
The Brooklyn born Teflon don, wrecking shop
Getting props, proving nobody drops
Words as potent as the blunt smoking Bed-Stuy bandit
And niggas just can't understand it
I bust a cap for the brothers in Nap Nap, Comstock, and Clinton
You know my shit is hitting
Yeah ya'll a fly nigga, Biggie Smalls
Kicking flavor, make a nigga wanna dig up in they drawers
For the burner, catch a body
I got styles like karate
Jujitsu, when I hit you then I split you
Like a cantaloupe
Hope you got a rope to hang yourself
I rob for self, from Brooklyn, where else
Fat like a Lexus coupe, I'll rip your troop
Not even Lois Lnae could get the scoop
What you think I'm stupid
My crew is mad deep
I hope you niggas sleep
I throw a bomb through you window
Burn you up and your hoe
I catch your mama going to therapy
And cut her throat
You lil' sister walking home from school
I abduct her, then I fuck her
I hit ya park close up with the Louisville Slugger
BGeezy is the hustla, ignorant motherfucker
I was taught how to bust heads by the best head busters
Cluckers, you know I got'em 2 for 1 my nigga
I'm on V L  if you want me, get some my nigga, come on
Thuggin is my thing, if I'm beefing I'm banginhg
Slanging, it's in my nature, gotta be about my paper
Haters, I don't like'em, bitches, I don't trust'em
Niggas, I can't stand'em, I creep down and pluck'em
Strap say in my hand, I gotta protect mine
Niggas trying to pull it off, pop goes the nine
That's how it gotta be in these uptown streets
And a nigga like me, I play the game for keep
I remember when niggaz slang heroin up in balloons
I paid attention to everything , from killings to cartoons
Got a picture of Malcolm X on the wall in my room Bitch
on some ol' nigga fuck wit me I'ma do 'em shit
Nigga give me dope, I accept it, but don't respect him
Put my foot in they rectum right after I dome check 'em
I be popping D, smoking weed, and full of that Hennesey
Fresh off the streets on my way to the penitentiary
Everybody whisper in ears when they gone mention me
I been out doing it for years, since elementary
Real good relationship with guns and drugs
Because my whole neighborhood consist of crook and thugs
Everything is my own shit cause I don't fuck with scrubs
I don't need you harassing me when I'm up in the club
Trying to hustle a nigga, asking me for a dub
Quarter, ki's, and halfs is what I sling, cause that's what I love
I know you bitches know that I ain't to be played with
Dont have no picks and chooses who get they head split
They die quick, fuckin' with Turk, wodie get whacked
Spend a bin with Kevin and Randy leave ya flat on you back
and trust that, ain't bout to let no nigga steal me
Fuck that, I bust back with 223
Big and full of that raw with no cut and be ready to creep
Innocent people move 'cause somebody fix'n to get split
Na, Na, it's iceberg shorty, Lordy have mercy
Come from under my shirts and flip'em and reverse'em
I'm coming so alert them
Ur, Ur fore I hurt them, desert eagle bursting

Stashing keys hidin' G's overseas

Game elevates, money I make
Gets your stocks and real estates, bitch
Jet skiing in the Caribean, white sands
Discusing plans with my mans
Dark blue land, smoke tint chrome rims and system

Drop to your knees and show gratitude
Kiss my rings it's a Frank White thing I stay potent
Bitch is devoted, take my dick and deep throat it
Eternal sunshine in this elevated world of mine
Looking for this hour glass of time
Trying to find my purpose on this grand design

Is there any money out there for me?
You just listen to this husler's story

Let's go
Niggaz in my faction don't like asking questions
Strictly gun testing, coke measuring
Giving pleasure in the Benz-ito
Hitting fanny, spendin chips at Manny's
Hope you creeps got receipts, my peeps get dirty like cleats
Run up in your crib, wrap you up in your Polo sheets
Six up in your wig piece, nigga decease
Muah!, may you rest in peace
With my Sycamore style, more sicker than yours
Four-four, and fifty-four draw
As my pilot, steers my Leer
Yes my dear shit's official, only the Feds I fear
Here's a tissue, stop your blood clot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dyin, no lying
So don't you get suspicious
I'm Big dangerous you're just a Likkle Vicious
As I leave my competition, respirator style
Climb the ladder to success, escalator style
Hold y'all breath, I told y'all, death controls y'all
Big don't fold y'all, big don't fold y'all
I spit phrases that'll thrill you, thrill you
You're nobody till somebody kills you I don't wanna die
Do you know where your going too
Just a memory everybody dying
When I throw my clip in the AK
May you rest in peace
Your nobody till somebody kills you
Do you know where your goin too
Just a memory so you better pack a pistol
Everybody dying, death controls y'all
Your nobody till somebody kills you
Label limbo, I treat it like the wind blows
My back don't bend, see papi is my kenfolk
Spin out the work, as if its on a ten spoke
Soul benefactor the benz, he made the rims poke
Trust me they can't touch P, in one touchie
Turn drop-head coupe to dune-buggy
Admire the verses, their inspired by the hearses
That carried my niggaz, and had the church mothers cursing
Imagine the glamour that comes out the flow
Of a nigga who still play in the snow like Santa
The wrist is rushing, my ears is blushing
And the diamonds in my chain, big as grandma's buttons, yes!
On the flipside, the steel I'm gripping
You thought all the floss had me slipping?
Think again, blink again let me know that your bluffing
Lead give permanent concussion, your nothing
Ha ha ha ha ha check out the fisad
On the face of rap, so we gon raise the bar
A mil on the crib, mean a quarter on the car
Bentley coupe another short of the arnage
Even as a youth I was laudering the stoop
Underneath the nose, and the Feds had no clue
I was pushing keys in a V with no roof
Rich, black, two big guns and no coof
Things at the label, well they tend to get unstable
And that pretty much leave Malice at the table
Or over the stove with the flame to the ladle
Because Im a provider as long as I am able
This here hughe the most foolish of blues
When I tell my mom the price
She near sent me to my room
It's the M-A-L-I-C-I-O-U-S
You don't wanna try nigga, you next uhh
Biggie Duets

Motherfuckers 
Fuck all you hoes Get a grip motherfucker 
Yeah, this album is dedicated to all the teachers that told me 
I'd never amount to nothin', to all the people that lived above the 
buildings that I was hustlin' in front of that called the police on 
me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughters, 
and all the niggaz in the struggle, you know what I'm sayin'?
Uh-ha, it's all good baby bay-bee, uh
It was all a dream 
I used to read Word Up magazine 
Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine 
Hangin' pictures on my wall 
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr  Magic, Marley Marl 
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed and bamboo, sippin' on private stock 
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack 
With the hat to match 
Remember Rappin' Duke, duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far 
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight 
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade 
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner 
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner 
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri 
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky 
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would 
Call the crib, same number same hood 
It's all good 
Uh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga, uh
You know very well who you are
Don't let em hold you down, reach for the stars
You had a go, but not that many
'cause you're the only one I'll give you good and plenty
I made the change from a common thief 
To up close and personal with Robin Leach 
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day 
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way 
The Moet and Alize keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me 
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me 
I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff 
I was too used to packin' gats and stuff 
Now honies play me close like butter played toast 
From the Mississippi down to the east coast 
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks 
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak 
Livin' life without fear 
Puttin' 5 karats in my baby girl's ears 
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool 
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school 
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood 
And it's still all good 
Uh and if you don't know, now you know, nigga 
Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis 
When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this 
50 inch screen, money green leather sofa 
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur 
Phone bill about two G's flat 
No need to worry, my accountant handles that 
And my whole crew is loungin' 
Celebratin' every day, no more public housin' 
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack 
Now my mom pimps a Ac' with minks on her back 
And she loves to show me off, of course 
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source 
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us 
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us 
Birthdays was the worst days 
Now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay 
Uh, right I like the life I live 
'Cause I went from negative to positive 
And it's all 
It's all good
and if you don't know, now you know, nigga, uh
Uh, uh and if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Uh and if you don't know, now you know, nigga, uh
Representin' B-Town in the house, Junior Mafia, mad flavor, uh

This goes out to you
This goes out to you, and you, and you, and you
Your reign on the top was short like leprechauns
As I crush so-called willies, thugs, and rapper-dons
Get in that ass, quick fast, like ramadan
It's that rap phenomenon Don-Dadda, fuck Poppa
You got ta, call me, Francis M H  White
in tank-light totes, tote iron
Was told in shootouts, stay low, and keep firin
Keep extra clips for extra shit
Who's next to flip, on that cat with that grip on rap
The most shady "Tell 'em!" Frankie baby
Ain't no tellin where I may be
May see me in D C  at Howard homecomin
with my man Capone, dumbin, fuckin somethin
You should know my steelo
Went from ten G's for blow to thirty G's a show
to orgies with hoes I never seen befo'
So, Jesus, get off the Notorious
penis, before I squeeze and bust
If the beef between us, we can settle it
With the chrome and metal shit
I make it hot, like a kettle get
You're delicate, you better getwho sent ya?
You still pedal shit, I got more rides than  Great Adventure 
Biggie "How are you gonna do it?"
Kick in the door, wavin the four-four
All you heard was Poppa don't hit me no more
On ya mark, get set, when I spark, ya wet
Look how dark it get, when you're marked for death
Should I start your breath should I let you die
In fear you start to cry, ask why
Lyrically, I'm worshipped, don't front the word sick
You cursed it, but rehearsed it
I drop unexpectedly like bird shit
You herbs get, stuck quickly for royalties and show money
Don't forget the publishin, I punish em, I'm done with them
Son, I'm surprised you run with them
I think they got cum in them, cause they, nothin but dicks
Tryin to blow up like nitro and dynamite sticks
Mad I smoke hydro rock diamonds that's sick
Got paid off my flow, rhyme with my own click
Take trips to Cairo, layin with yo' bitch
I know you prayin you was rich, fuckin prick
When I see ya I'ma
This goes out for those that choose to use
disrespectful views on the King of NY
Fuck that, why try, throw bleach in your eye
Now ya braille in it, stash that light shit, or scalin it
Conscience of ya nonsense in eighty-eight
Sold more powder than Johnson and Johnson
Tote steel like Bronson, "Vigilante"
You wanna get on son, you need to ask me
Ain't no other king in this rap thing
They siblings, nothing but my chil'ren
One shot, they disappearin
It's ill when, MC's used to be on cruddy shit
Took home, "Ready to Die," listened, studied shit
Now they on some money shit, successful out the blue
They light weight, fragilly, my nine milly
make the white shake, thats why my money never funny
And you still recoupin, stupid 
I told you
See, I told y'all muh'fuckers
Yo yothat stupid nigga man
I told y'all to stop!
He fucked up, yo
I pray for you to stop
But no, you didn't stop
And now, we won't stop
Time, time for you to die
As I kissyo'assgoodnight
I make yo' mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
When I release, you loose teeth like Lil' Cease
Nigga please, blood floods yo' Dungarees
And that's just the half on my warpath
Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater
than the average playa hater, and spectators
buy my CD twice  they see me in the streets
They be like, "Yo he nice, but that's on the low doe"
Be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
I pull out fo'-fo's, and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggaz, snort-caine niggaz
Extortion came quicker, bought the Range nigga
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be
til Lil' Cease crippled me
Now I play hard, like my girls nipples be
The game sour like like a pickle be, y'all know da rules
Move from BK to New Jeruz -- thinkin bout
all the planes we flew, bitches, we ran through
Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two
Motherfuckers mad cause I blew, niggaz envious
Too many niggaz on my dick, shit strenuous
When my men bust, you just move wit such stamina
Slugs missed ya, I ain't mad at cha we ain't mad at cha
Blood rushin, concussions, ain't nothin
Catch cases, come out frontin, smokin somethin
Sippin White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumpin
I laced it wit the basic, six TV's a system
Knockin Mase shit, face it, we hard to hit
Guard ya shit, 'fore I stick you, for your re-up
Wipe the pee up, mixed shots, woke your seed up
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up, LONG KISS
Nowwe don't give a fuck
We just absolutelydon't give a fuck
Becausethere ain't no motherfuckin love here
There ain't no love here
You know, wewe just gon' keep doin what we do
We gon' keep FUCKIN YOU UP
And I'ma keep stompin your MOTHERFUCKIN HEAD IN
you FUCKIN BITCH, c'mon!!
UhhI'm flamin gats, aimin at, these fuckin
maniacs, put my name in raps, what part the
game is that?Like they hustle backwards
I smoke Blackwoods and Dutchies, ya can't touch me
Try to rush me, slugs go, touchy-touchy
You're bleedin lovely, wit'chyo, spirit above me
or beneath me, your whole life you live sneaky
Now you rest eternally, sleepy, you burn when you creep me
Rest where the worms and the weak be
My nine flies, baptize, rap guys
With the Holy Ghost, I put holes in most
You hold your toast shaky, slippin tryin to break me
Look what you made me do, brains blew
My team in the marine-blue, six Coupe
Skied it out, weeded out, cleanin out -- the block
for distances, givin long kisses BITCH
All we have to do nowis say a prayer for youy'know?
That's all we have to do, just to pray for your mindcause
Eheh, see your mind got control of your heart
when it's supposed to be the other way around
Your heart's supposed to got control of your mind
So now, I have no feelings for you
You have made me cold
Frank White the menacin, Chron Chron's the medicine
I got the lettuce and, you turn green like cucumber skin
Got the new, Hummer in the summer when I was a new comer
then, drugs and mac-10's
Hugs from fake friends, make ends they hate you
Be broke -- girls won't date you
That's why I relate to, choke yo' ass out til your face blue
Make you, open the safe too
No matter how you call it how you call it
this brolic, alcoholic
like his weed green'd out, like his brick solid
Distribute to, kids who, take heart like Valentine
Drink Ballentine, all the time
Slugs hit your chest tap you spine, flatline
Heard through the grapevine, you got fucked fo' times
Damn that three to nine, fucked you up for real doe
Sling steal slow, as for remorse, we feel no
See the fucked up thing is that I love you
yaknahmsayin?
It's just in my nature to love you
I can't hate youcause it's not in my nature to hate you
You know, I don't know
MaybeI'm a different type of individual
Butyou have me on the line
and there's a thin line between love and hate
And God forbid I cross that line
Cause y'all not gonna give a fuck
I'm tellin you right, MOTHERFUCKIN, NOW!!
THE SHIT, Y'ALL DONE STARTED, IS NEVER GONNA STOP!!!
WE ARE NEVER GONNA STOP!!!
And we not talkin boutno other rappers
We talkin bout YOU motherfucker
YOU KNOW, who I'm talkin to
We comin for you
The shit's gon' feel so good
I'm gon' make you love me baby 
Can I live til my last day
Hittin honies that be na-sty
Gettin money in the fast way
And I only care halfway
But I still can't let you pass me
Yo what's beef to you, three niggaz with hoodies and bats
That ain't shit compared to one small cat with gats
When we came here we cut off all kind circulation
Breathin, eatin, the whole situation
When we do our shit we do our shit for real
While you take your money for your deal and make your own beats
Compose your own sheets, that's aight but chill
I'ma spend that mil and cop only hot shit
Rock top shit you know how The Lox get
Then you can see me flyin in the Bentley cockpit
Lox and B-I, hold our grica down for years
Gang not, but we been had our black tears
Niggaz under the stairs only understand what we got
Underground, all above must get shot
You couldn't book me Dano, Sheek Luciano put the burners
to all y'all, what nigga bring it I'm callin y'all
You already know what it's about when I run up in your house
Put the gun up in your mouth and get the money out the couch
Hearin you out is senseless, perhaps for instance
I give this faggot a french kiss
Black gloves, no prints, dark tints
Word on the street they ain't heard from him since
You know about life after kicked the kid in
Since me and my mi-dan can flip seven gri-dams
Scri-dam the flow is forbidd-en
Either you ridin or you dyin cause we swingin iron
Lox and Poppa, turning niggaz into Jim Hoffa
Who gon stop us, it's your last joint double copper
You gettin money or your runnin from the Feds
Ain't nothin over here but sixteen and one in the head
And I solemnly swear
That all y'all niggaz out there got a problem this year
Before you think of keepin me down, heatin me down
The flow like water get deepe and you drown
with no soul, many niggaz roll with no dough
Even the small Dunn got a little black hole
Your destiny is somethin you can never figure out
Niggaz is never happy til there's blood up in your mouth
There's a lot of killers, but who the hell are you to play in this?
A lot are dead, how the hell you take the pain?
Live with it got money you better get with it
My man had the thug in him did his bid with it
Get married to the game but never have a kid with it
Advice from the wise, slice the pies
Too many schemes divides, when dreams collide
Teams provide, war for the street to absorb
Stashed in the ceiling and you slept on the floor
Only a blind dove'll fall in love with a whore
Who the fuck wanna squeeze?
My Desert Ease make MC's freeze
You wakin up in cold sweats, they just dreams
You still apoligizin, analyzin, my size and your size and
realizin, a fist fight would be asinine
You just pop wines I must pop nines
Genuine steel piece, nozzle in your grill piece
You're shook up, two bricks, every cook up
We can hook up, all I see is the future
Disrespect, I shoot ya
By the way, them bricks, get flipped weekly
Sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak
Die for a dollar nigga, life ain't sweet
Play for keeps wet shirts with experts on the creep
I be the mob fiance, about to marry it
Illegal transactions in Farragut with Arabics
Why not, they fit twelve up in the bedroom
Imagine what they stash is like, make you a classic like
my first LP, beef with me is unhealthy
Fuck around and get an ul-cer, loose your pulse or
collapsed lung, look how many gats I brung
For them homos, still doin promos
Break both your legs you're movin slow-mo, got shined to glow mo'
Nine hundred and ninety six grams, you need for mo'
What? That's right

Dummies, Playboy bunnies, those wantin money
Those the ones I like cause they don't get nathan
but penetration, unless it smells like sanitation
Garbage, I turn like doorknobs
Heartthrob, never, black and ugly as ever
However, I stay Coogi down to the socks
Rings and watch filled with rocks
And my jam knock in your Mitsubishi
Girls pee pee when they see me
Navajos creep me in they teepee
As I lay down laws like Alan Coppet
Stop it, if you think you're gonna make a profit
Don't see my ones, don't see my gunsget it
Now tell ya friends Poppa hit it, then split it

Thought he worked his until I handled my biz
There I is  Major Payne like Damon Wayans
Low Down, Dirty even, like his brother Keenan
Schemin, don't leave ya girl 'round me
True player for real ask Puff Daddy
You ringin bells with bags from Chanel
Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel
Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell
She beeped me, meet me at twelve
Where you at? Flippin jobs, payin car notes?
While I'm swimmin in ya women like the breast stroke
Right stroke, left stroke was the best stroke
Death stroketongue all down her throat
Nuttin left to do but send her home to you
I'm through, can ya sing the song for me boo?
One more chance, Biggie give me one more chance

So, what's it gonna be, him or me?
We can cruise the world with pearls, gator boots for girls
The envy of all women, crushed linen
Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in 'em
Finest women I love with a passion
Ya man's a wimp, I give that ass a good thrashin
High fashion, flyin into all states
Sexin me while ya man masturbates
Isn't this great? Your flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent
I'm not only a client, I'm the Player President
I got that good love girl, you didn't know?
East coast West coast 
Welcome to The House of Pain, Just Blaze nigga
Intro Mary J  Blige
There's no way out, it seems I can't get free
Somebody tell mewhat's happening to me
The country bud got me choking
I'm on a mission to the point that motherfuckers think I'm smoking
Yeah that sick nigga Biggie with the 8 shot fifth
With the extra clip for that extra shit
Don't you know that a killing is thrilling?
All the blood spilling, is all up on the drug dealing
A born gangsta my daddy was a thug
Had a  38 with the hallow point slug
So when he lit shots
Niggas dropped, quicker than bootlegger sells his liquor
A little nigga tried to squeeze  22's in my Reebok shoes
Paying dudes, while kids was on their one's and two's
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
Got the MAC-11 swinging from my shoulder
It's a shame I got to put my mom through the strain
I'm living in The House of Pain
Is anybody listening tell me can you see this?
Darkness be surrounding me
Now it's getting colder heavy on my shoulder
And it's getting hard to breathe
And it's getting blurry, I'm getting worried
'Cause it's getting hard to see
When your lamping in The House of Paaaiiinnn
The motherfucking dust kicker, Who can you trust?
Who gave you the heart to see a nigga?
Before you bust, my name is spoken on the tongue of so many foes
Busting motherfuckers out the blocks I ain't even go
Now how the hell do you explain my claim to fame?
From doing fix to busting tricks out the fucking frame
Got these bitches on my jock, niggas on my block
Jealous ass suckers got it ducking for my fucking glock
And busting niggas ass is to stay alive
Skinny ass playa watching victim motherfuckers fry
They ask me how I'm living? How I'm a hustler?
Bucking busters 'til they die
Now it's on in the ghetto you ain't heard?
Niggas got they AK's heading for the bird
Aiming at them skinny ass bitches let 'em rain
Giving 'em or wetting 'em, welcome to The House of Pain
MJB, be worried niggas, yeah, Nas 
Yeah, Wuttup BI 'Pac
Wendy Williams say "I stay dust" then maybe I should
'Cause these rappers will have your phone tapped like Savion Glove
And on the West yo police corrupt, some are bloods
But these Teflon I loaded explode in some mugs
I'm like Furious in 'Boyz 'N The Hood'
But at the drive-thru I ain't running I'm dumping
Crazy like a Piru and loc'd up, know how Nas do
I'm calling Henchmen and Conception
To organize a Black Truce
And we party hard party with Nas
Since they ain't no moreMardi gras
And Bush won't apologize
I got gangsta hoes Kobe Bryant scared to sodomize
And  45's for them suckers y'all idolize
Y'all yelling my name, but y'all soon dying
Who be trying to portray real but they be lying
'Cause they want the real niggas to die so they can gain
But neva that, this ain't neva last, this The House of Pain
Yo Bigs man, what's wrong man?
You look like you got problems man
Hey yo man, pssh man
It's this fuckin BITCH man!
Shit I know I ain't 'sposed to have
no feelings for these hoes out here man, but
This bitch on the back of my mind man word?
Yeah man done wrote a rhyme 'bout the bitch man
Let me hear it Want me to drop the drama kid? Yeah
Yeah, dedicatin this to you man
Cause my man 50 Gran' told me straight up and down man
I ain't 'sposed to love no ho
Knahmsayin? I tried to tell her 50
I got three rules in life
I'm not to be played with, played on or played out
I'ma drop it like dis
Lyin in my bed, I'm lookin at four walls
Echo in my head sayin I got a lot of gall
Grippin my cap, my pen in my teeth
Thinkin what this ho said, she called me a thief
She said I stole her heart, and didn't leave a trace
I told her I was sorry and she said get out my face
Walked out my door with my Walkman in my pocket
Playin "Love Is a House," and thinkin how she jocked it
when she had the key, to open up my door
Adore, that Prince scam that got me on the floor
I know that she loved me, I couldn't ever fake it
I say go buy a pie, the girl would go bake it
Makin a record was important to me
More important than her that's what made her flee, see
The mistake was not payin no mind
All her posse said we was two of a kind
I call her back twice, your sister said you're broke
She said when you left, your ears was full of smoke
Chokin on a cigarette you don't even smoke
Jumped in the train station put in a token
Coulda been my partner, my amigo my peer
Just waitin for them three words that all girls wanna hear
I love you, HUH, you would start to cry if
I would reply with I-L-Y
Then I tell your friends that you played me out
Said I wouldn't say "I love you" just to make you shout
So I, call up 7 digits that would pick up your phone
Your sister picked it up and said that you wasn't home
I heard you in the back cryin up a storm
Screamin how you wish that I never was born
"I hate him! I hate him!" That's what she kept sayin
She'll come to her senses is what I kept prayin
But now I'm gonna lay the cards on the line
Just say that you hate me, or say that you're mine
I said, when I played ball you was in the stands
When I was sick, you held my hand
It was hard to say before, but now I can
Bitch I love no ho, FUCK YA!
I don't give a fuck about'cha
Take a long walk off a short peer bitch
Try to take bankrolls
Bum bitches outta here 50 man
Now check it
Come to my crib she say B I G  listen
I don't like the way you been dissin
Feel like I been kissin other bitches cause my lips feel chapped
I tell you it's on the blunts, you ain't tryin to hear that
Now I'm Henny'd like a fuck? What's the riff?
Who I'm sleepin with? I ain't got the time
to shoot the gift to hoes, I'm tryin to take bankroll
I ain't fuckin nobody, case closed
You hit the lights and decide to doze off
No kiss goodnight, didn't take your clothes off
And my dick is harder than a rock
Nobody to cockblock but youse a hardrock
The fuck you think I am, gay?
I ain't got no time to play I ain't got nuttin to say
Bounce out the crib, just to see my man 50
and what's up with B I G 
And the O G B , you know they keep plenty hookers
And I ain't a bad looker
So I see one ho that I like yeah, oooh

Trust no hoes, all they want is bankroll
That's what I'm tryin to tell you now baby
My man 50 done schooled me to all y'all hookers

Can't spell game without me, the B I G 
A whole lotta niggaz want Big to make a demo tape
'Specially that, BUM-ASS NIGGA uhh
This goin out to you nigga recognize
Yo 50, what's this?
Microphone murderer, mass mayhem maker
B I G 's on the mic, call the undertaker
Make an appointment, schedule a interview
Because you know what Big Man's about to do
50 Gran' on the Technic at the right peak
Brothers wanna hear the words Big Man speak
The microphone I rip it, the burner got the clip in
Slammin MC's like Scottie Pippen
Flippin on Old Gold, cold as the rhymes you stole
Puffin on dime bags and I been told
My words are harder than a brick, Chinese arithmetic
a thick stick and my dick
Makes me sick when you pick the whick-whack rhyme G
You get what you pumpin is Tic-Tac time Z
B I G  moves swifter than a ninja
Even on stickups I'm the masked avenger
Keep my eyes open and the case closed
No eyewitnesses, no names or expos
Just the heavyset one with the big gun
and a sweet tongue shakin down everyone
Loot like Michael Jackson kicks like Bo Jackson
Benz like Freddie Jackson, no need to ask in the crew
Oooh! No frontin, no fakin moves
Fightin or fuckin, resort to the stick and move
Smack the fool that disagree, recognize the pedigree
Rhyme is mine cause I said it's me
Step to a Big Man grippin the mic stand
Keep a bankroll and so do 50 Gran'
And, I give you my hand cause you deserve a pound
Tryin to blow up the spot, in my part of town
Braves, because you get no praise
I treat you like did the A's
Recognize, I don't fuck with the St  Ides
B I G  down with O G B 
Old Gold Brothers for the others that missed me
The crew stay deep on Bedford and Quincy
Rhymes in the pocket for a quick hand to hand
You want it to be on, there's a Tec in the garbage can
I pull bitches like Kim Fields, Brooke Shields
Shelley Long, Connie Chung, I can go on and on
Word is bond I'm a don!
I split 'em and run up in 'em I fuck 'em and then I duck 'em
I hit 'em in the shitter and forget her, and it gets better
B I G  are the letters
Niggaz know the pedi' 
That's the end!! What you want me to do? DAMN!

Yo wassup? You ready son?

It didn't take long before I made you my wife 
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze

During the days you helped me bag up my nickels Come on
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch That's right

Any place with another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it That's right
One day she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet 
Throwin my clothes out the windows windows

She still sweat me hard 'cause I'm a rap star
I be cruisin up the block, I be passin her
Pimpin hard with the female passenger
And the only time I call her to hang
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, schemin on a gang-bang
She should've used her intuition
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen
She's sayin I dissed her 'cause I'm fuckin her sister
A message to the fellas, that really gets 'em pissed, uh
But she started that fuckin family
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me?
Plus your sister look better than you
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you

Tell me what you're goin through, oh yeah
I remember sellin three bricks of straight flour
Got my man a beat down to the third power
He didn't care, spent the money in a half hour
Got some fishscale, rained on competition like a shower
Got the coke cooked up, a crackhead Kevin
In eighty-eight, when Kane ruled, with Half Steppin
A thirty-eight, a lot of mouth, was our only weapon
We was king till the G's crept in
And now I'm missin em
Ooh, I'm missin you
Tell me why the road turns, why it turns
Ooh, I'm missin you
Nah nah nah nah nah, oh tell me why why why why
We work all week, weekends we play the movies
We rock flatops, our girls rocked doobies
Made a killin, even though the D's knew me
Eventually, you know they try to do me, fuck it
Fed up, my nigga wanted to take it down South
Sick of cops comin, sick of throwin jacks in his mouth
Gave him half my paper, told 'em go that route
Few months, he got his brain blown out
Now I'm stressed
His baby's mother, she trippin, blamin me
And his older brothers, understand, the game it be
Kinda topsy turvy  you win some, you lose some
Damn, they lost a brotherthey mother lost a son
Fuck, why my nigga couldn't stay in NY?
I'm a thug, but I swear for three days I cried
I look in the sky and ask God why
Can't look his baby girls in the eye
Damn I miss you
There was this girl around the way that make cats drool
Her name's Drew, played fools out they money in pool
People swore we was fuckin but we was just cool
She used to hang while I slang my drugs after school
She'd watch my bomb, help my moms with the groceries
My little sister, the girl was kinda close to me
A little closer than the average girl's supposed to be
Far from a lover, my girl was jealous of her
Then she started messin with some major players
Handled keys, niggas called them the Bricklayers
A dread kid, had a baby fore that bitch Taya
Found out her baby's father cheatin, now Drew she gotta slay her
One night, across from the corner store

Squeezed all six shots in the passenger door
The dude lived, what my baby had to die for
We missin her

It's like the more money we come across, the more problems we see
Yo let, let, let me ask you a question yo
Yo would you kill for me?
What took you so long to answer motherfucker?
I don't know
The fuck wrong with you bitch?
When I met you I admit my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good huh, I suck on your daddy's dick 
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife uh, yeah
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze
Come into the crib, even had a set a keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little 
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch uhh
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right
Just me and my bitch variations repeat to next verse
But you know you love that ass, don't you?
Yeah, no question
No question
Yo, let me ask you another question
What?
You ever fuck around on me?
Why would I do that?
Yo don't lie to me motherfucker
Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh no, that's not my steelo
I wanna bitch that like to play celo, and craps
Packin gats, in a Coach bag steamin dime bags
A real bitch is all I want, all I ever had yeah, c'mon
With a glock just as strong as me
Totin guns just as long as me, the bitch belongs with me
Any plans with another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet that's nasty
Throwin my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight G
And then we lie together, cry together
I swear to God I hope we fuckin die together
Let me tell you nigga, if I ever, ever catch your ass fuckin around
I'ma cut your mother-fuckin dick off
Hah, heheh stop playin, hah
I ain't playin, ain't no jokes, ain't no jokes
Ain't no jokes
Yo, don't don't play with my dick
She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies
Didn't hesitate to squeeze, to get my life out of danger 
One day, she put nine one one on the page
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major 
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggaz felt they had to kill the closest one to me uh, yeah
And when I find em your life is to and end
They killed my best friend me and my bitch
motherfucker yeah
I remember I met this one bitch
Cause you know me I don't see how I'm the nasty motherfucker
I just thought I thought I'da did anything in the world yeh?

You annoint my head with oil, my cup overflows
Surely goodness and love will follow me -- all the days of my life
And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever

I don't wanna die, God tell me why
Watch Casino, I'm the hip-hop version of Nicky Tarantino
Ask Nino, he know
Green with envy, the green tempts me
to make the rich the enemy, and take their cheese
Take their spots, take their keys, make my faculty
live happily, ever after in laughter
Hah, never seen Cristal pour faster
And to those bastards, knuckleheads squeeze lead
Three of mine dead, nuttin left to do

Have the biggest dick, but when your shell get hit

On the road to the riches more furs to drag
More niggaz to kill, than birds to bag
Hit the jeweler and splurge the tab, uh

calm as possible, make the deal go through
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make yo killings clean, slugs up in between

Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, yo life is on the shelf, we mean this Frank
Them cats we fuckin wit put bombs in yo' moms gas tank
Let's get this money baby, they shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies and burn 'em with dirty 380's
Then they come to kill our babies, that's all out
I got gats that blow the wall out, clear the mall out
Fuck the fallout, word to Stretch I bet they pussy
The seven digits push me, fuckin real, here's the deal
I got a hundred bricks, fourteen-five apiece 
Enough to cop a six  buy the house on the beach 
Supply the peeps with Jeeps, brick apiece, capiche?
Everybody gettin cream no one considered them leech
Think about it now, thats near one-point-five
I kill 'em all I'll be set for life, Frank pay attention
These motherfuckers is henchmen, renegades
If you die they still get paid, extra probably
Fuck a robbery, I'm the boss
Promise you won't rob 'em, I promise
But of course you know I had my fingers crossed
Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein scared
of a nigga that breathe the same air as me
Niggas bleed just like us
Picture me bein shook
We can both pull burners, make the motherfuckin beef cook
Niggas bleed just like us
Picture a nigga hidin
My life in that man hands, while he just decidin
Niggas bleed just like us
I'd rather go toe to toe with all of y'all
Runnin ain't in my protocol
Since it's on, I call my nigga Arizona Ron
From Tuscon, pushed the black Yukon
Usually had the slow grooves on, mostly rock the Isley
Stupid as a young'un, chose not the moves wisely
Sharper with game, him and his crooks, called The Juxs
Heard it was sweet, bout three-fifty a piece
Ron bought a truck, two bricks laid in the cut
His peeps got bucked, got locked the fuck up
That's when Ron vanished, came back, speakin Spanish
Lavish habits, two rings, twenty carats
Here's a criminal, nigga made America's Most
Killed his baby mother brother, slit his throat
The nigga got bagged with the toast
Weeded, took it to trial, beat it
Now he feel he undefeated, he mean it
Nothing to lose, tattooed around his gun wounds
Everything to gain, embedded in his brain
And me I feel the same for this money and diamonds
Specially if my daughter cryin, I ain't lyin
Y'all know the science
We agreed to go on shootin is silly
Because niggas could be hidin in showers with mac-milli's
So I freaked 'em, the telly manager was Puerto Rican
Gloria, from Astoria, I went to war with her
peeps in ninety-one, stole a gun from my workers
And they took drugs, they tried to jerk us
We blazed they place, long story, Glo' seent my face
Got shook, thought a nigga was comin for the safe
Now she breakin, shut up, 112, what's shakin?
A Jamaican, some bitches I swear, they look gay
in a black Range Rover, been outside all day
If it's trouble let me know, I'll be on my way
Please, I got kids to feed, I done seen you make niggas bleed
Nightmare, this bitch don't need it
Ron, get the gasoline, this spot, we bout to blow this
Get the cash before the cops and Range Rover cats notice
Room 112, right by the staircase, perfect place
When they evacuate, they meet they fate
Ron pass the gasoline, the nigga passed me kerosene uhh
Fuck it, it's flame-able, my hunger is unexplainable
Strike the match, just what I expected
The dread kid ejected in seconds
And here come two, opposite sexes, one black, one Malaysian
We in the hallway waitin patient
As soon as she hit the door we start blastin
I saw her brains hit the floor, Ron laughin, I swear to God
I hit Maxi Priest at least twelve times in the chest
Spint around, shot the chink in the breast
She cryin, headshots put her to rest
Pop open the briefcases, nothin but Franklin faces
The spot's hot, sprinklers, alarm systems
That's when other guests start to slip in
It's time for us to get to dippin
I know them niggas in the Range is on they way up
Flippin, pistol grippin, I load the clip in
The hallway, got real loud and crowded
They walked right past us, I don't know how they allowed it
The funny thing about it, through all the excitement
They Range got towed, they double parked by a hydrant
Stupid motherfuckers
All you hoes, callin' here for my daddy get off his dick 
Like that Mommy?
Answering machine beep in between each message and the beat to "One
More Chance in the background

You know the ep along by James Todd Smith

Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit

Fuck the past let's dwell on the 500 SL, the E and J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rim with Benjamins
Another hon's in the crib, please send her in

But lickin clits had to stop
Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow, really though

So take off your Tim boots and your bodysuit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex gettin rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker

and if I'm caressin em, I'm undressin em
Fuck whatcha heard who's the best in New York
For fillin fantasies without that nigga Mr  Rourke?
Or Tattoo I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I'm done I got to split shit
Back shots is my position, I gotcha wishin for an intermission
Fuck the kissin, lickin down to your belly button, I ain't frontin
They don't call me B I G  for nuttin, all of a sudden
Oh Biggie gimme one more chance
I got that good dick girl you didn't know
I was a terror since the public school era
Bathroom passes, cuttin classes, squeezing asses
Smoking blunts was a daily routine
Since thirteen, a chubby nigga on the scene
I used to have the tre` duce
And the duce duce in my bubblegoose
Now i got the mack in my knapsack
Loungin' black, smoking sacks up in acts
And sidekicks with my sidekicks rockin fly kicks
Honeys want to chat
But all we wanna know is "Where the party at?"
And can i bring my gat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot
But i throw my vest on my chest
'Cause niggaz is a mess
It don't take nothin' but frontin' 
For me to start somethin'
Buggin' and barkin' at niggaz like i was duck huntin'
Dumbing out, just me and my crew
Cause all we wanna do is 
Party And bullshit, and 
Hugs from the honeys, Pounds from the roughnecks
Seen my man Sei that I knew from the projects
Said he had beef, asked me if I had my peice
Sure do, two  22's in my shoes
Holler if you need me love i'm in the house
Roam and strollin' see what the honeys is about
Moet popping, hoe hopping, ain't no stopping Big Poppa, I'm a BAD BOY

Nigga I toast ya, put fear in your heart
Fuck up the party before it even start
Pissy drunk, off the Henny and stuff
Or some brand-nubian shit beatin' down punks!
Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress, i think i might just
Hit her with a little Biggie 101, How to tote a gun 
And have fun with Jamaician rum
Conversations, blunts in rotation
My man Big Jacques got the glock in his waist and
 we're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad than this nigga Biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eatin out my palm
She grabbed my arm and said "Let's leave calm"
I'm hittin' skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken
Niggaz start to loke out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out
Biggie breaks it up yelling "Yo chill, man, chill!"]
Can't we just all get along?
So i can put hickies on her chest like Li'l Shawn
Get her pissy drunk off of Don Perrignon
And it's on, and I'm gone

Smack ya cabbage, half-ass rappers, shouldn't have it
So I grab it, never run, the outcome
is usually, a beatdown brutally, fuck who you be
or where you're from, West or East coast, squeeze toast
Leave most in the blood they layin in, what, what?
The rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
It's more than I expected, I thought your jewels was rented
but they wasn't, so run it, cousin
I could chill, the heat doesn't
Ran up in your shell about a dozen
You never see bank like Frank White

Play hard like Reggie Miller, rapper, slash dope dealer
slash Gorilla, slash illest turned killer
Don't approach me with that rah rah shit, you out of pocket

Mentally my energy, is like a figure eight, on it's side
that's infinity -- too many sick niggaz, nickel nines 
bring the remedy -- when you play the field, what's the penalty
Unnecessary roughness, career endin injuries for suckers
Stuck on stupid, shoot em with a dart like Cupid
until they got love for my music
Star Wars I'm Han Solo, with three egoes
and three charges, I got to "See-three-P O 's"

Jeee-zus, "Unbelievable" rhyme that reaches

All about the fortune, fuck the fame, labels still extortin
Kick me when I'm down, but I'm up again, scorchin

Straight up playerlistic mentality
You just do your thing, Cause i'm definintley gone do mine
And we gon' hook up a lil later and do thing you never heard of
Can you feel me?
Bad Boy in the house for the '95
Big shout out to my man Mel Smith, my man Don Cee San in the house 
What's up Michelle Ray, what's up boo?
Sick of mama screaming that "Get a job, nigga"
Pressed to the limit, got to rob me a nigga
Simple and plain, my man scooped me in a hooptie
Whispered in his ear "This is what we got to do, G"
Got to bang a nigga and bang a nigga good
So I can cop a Benz and drive the fuck out the hood
Cause baby-mama screaming "Your daughter 12 months"
Can't live life swinging rocks and smoking blunts
Hanging wit the niggas dont pay the bills
And being broke and 30 give a nigga the chills
So what we gotta do is creep and see a sweet vic
Yo, you see that shit? Hell yeah, I seen that shit
Columbian Dominican, yeah whateva
Whoever he was, he had it tucked under the leather
Two keys, 20 G's, nigga please,
Blew his brains out cause witnesses we don't leave
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Cause real niggas do real things
Hanging wit the niggas is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging wit the niggas is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things
After mad blunts and gin we had the plan made
I bought my wifey a crib, I bought the MAFIA a arcade
Mad games: pool tables and candy
A little extra chicken loot be comin in handy
Check it, got on some '95 shit, sold the 5 bought the 6
Delvecc, copped the lex, we was set
We no had work all in the projects
Niggas slingin O's he kept the profit, no one could stop it
We was livin it up
All the sexy young bitches ain't stressin givin it up
Same bitches suckin dick tryin to dress to thrill me
Said the niggaz I killed is out to kill me
Soon as she smoked on that note, I saw trenchcoat
One had a mac spittin, all I saw was gun smoke
The other had a shottie,I was shootin everybody
And I wasn't missing had to get out this position
Niggas still hitting, feel a hot one in my back
Licked six shots, smoked a nigga wit the mac
The nigga wit the shottie still busting, cussing
Mighty goals and puntas
All I'm tryin to do is shoot ya, two shots in the ruger
Booh-yeah, blew his ass out
Then I passed out passed out, passed out
On the road to the riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging wit the niggas is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things
On the road to the riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging wit the niggas is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things
Bad Boy in the house, for the '95 peace
Real niggas, aight
The doctor said I need about three weeks of recovery
But the nurses is lovin me
Sayingthe best part of the day is my half
Feedin me breakfast and givin me a sponge baths
Niggas say I died dead in the streets
Nigga, I'm getting high getting head on the beach
Chillin, sittin on about half a million
With all my niggas, all my guns, all my women
Next two years, I could see about a billion
All for the love of drug dealin
Got no love for the other side, fuck them tricks
Any repurcussion, Junior M A F I A  spit clips
All the time, Big Poppa kick the raw rhyme
Raw flows, and that's how it goes
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging wit the niggas is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
You ready motherfucker?
We gon' kill your ass
As I grab the glock, put it to your headpiece
One in the chamber, the safety is off release
Straight at your dome homes, I wanna see cabbage
Biggie Smalls the savage, doin your brain cells much damage
Teflon is the material for the imperial
mic ripper girl stripper the Henny sipper
I drop lyrics off and on like a lightswitch
Quick to grab the right bitch and make her drive
the Q-45, glocks and tecs are expected when I wreck shit
Respect is collected, so check it
I got techniques drippin out my buttcheeks
Sleep on my stomach so I don't fuck up my sheets, huh
My shit is deep, deeper than my grave G
I'm ready to die and nobody can save me
Fuck the world, fuck my moms and my girl
My life is played out like a jheri curl, I'm ready to die
As I sit back and look when I used to be a crook
Doin whatever it took from snatchin chains to pocketbooks
A big BAD motherfucker on the wrong road
I got some drugs tried to get the avenue sold
I want it all from the Rolexes
to the Lexus gettin paid, is all I expected
My mother didn't give me what I want, what the fuck?
Now I got a glock, makin motherfuckers duck
Shit is real, and hungry's how I feel
I rob and steal because that money got that whip appeal
Kickin niggaz down the steps just for rep
Any repercussion lead to niggaz gettin wet
The infrared's at your head real steady
You better grab your guns cause I'm ready, ready
I'm ready to die!
Nah we ain't gon' kill your ass yet
We gonna make you suffer
In a sec I throw the tec to your fuckin neck
Everybody hit the deck, Biggie bout to get some wreck
Quick to leave you in a coffin, for slick talkin
You better act like CeCe, and keep on walkin
When I hit ya, I split ya to the white meat
You swung a left you swung a right you feel to the concrete
Your face, my feet, they meet, we're stompin
I'm rippin MC's from Tallahassee, to Compton
Biggie Smalls on a higher plane
Niggaz say I'm strange deranged because I put the 12 gauge to your brain
Make your shit splatter
Mix the blood like batter then my pocket gets fatter
after the hit, leave you on the street with your neck split
down your backbone to where your motherfuckin shit drip
The shit I kick, rip it through the vest
Biggie Smalls passin any test, I'm ready to die!
I'm ready
Time to go, we gonna put you out your misery motherfucker
Niggaz definitely know what time it is
The Notorious one in full effect
for ninety-three!
Suicidal, I'm ready!
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
Cause I'm ready to die
All y'all motherfuckers come with me if you want to
Biggie Smalls the biggest man
Rockin on and on in ninety-three, Easy Mo Bee
Third Eye, and the rest of the Bad Boy fam
I don't wanna see no cryin at my funeral
Nineteen-seventy somethin', nigga I don't sweat the date
My moms is late so I had to plan my escape
out the skins, in this world of fly girls
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I cold hurl
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck
I wish moms'd hurry up so I could get buck
wild, juvenile rippin' mics and shit
New York New York, ready for the likes of this, uh
Then came the worst date, May 21st
2:19, that's when my momma water burst
No spouse in the house so she rode for self
to the hospital, to see if she could get a little help
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck
I'm seein' my death and I ain't even took my first step
I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy
The doctor looked and said, "He's gonna be a Bad Boy"
Now I'm thirteen, smokin' blunts, makin' cream
On the drug scene, fuck a football team
Riskin' ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen
Hearin' the coach scream at my lifetime dream, I mean
I wanna blow up, stack my dough up
So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself
before I wreck myself, disrespect myself
Put the drugs on the shelf?Nah, couldn't see it
Scarface, King of New York, I wanna be it
Rap was secondary, money was necessary
Until I got incarcerated--kinda scary
C74-Mark 8 set me straight
Not able to move behind the great steel gate
Time to contemplate,, where did I fail?
All the money I stacked was all the money for bail
Ninety-four, now I explore new horizons
Mama smile when she see me, that's surprisin'
Honeys is tantalizin', they freak all night
Peep duckin' cops on the creep all night
As I open my eyes and realizin' I changed
Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game
And to my niggas livin' street life
Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest
Still tote your vest man, niggas be trippin'
In the streets without a gat?Nah, nigga you're slippin'
If I'm pimpin on The F with weed on my breath
Original hustler with the muffler on the Tec
Respect to the Mac's and the Ac's
To the freaks in the Jeeps, lick shots to my peeps
Where Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?
Where Brooklyn at?
1, 2, 3, and 
Now they say you ain't never suppose to envy no man
Can't tell that to a dingy old man
Who see a young nigga getting plently dough man
Icy Audemar, hendy gold band
With a mean girl like Lindsay Lohan
That's why I keep the 9 in the Bently door pan
Trust it's gon' bust you roll on us
Know it's gon' blow for my dough
Why would you try with that guy
Scene told you he keep it G
We can bang like the two chains on my neck
The hood is Iraq I'm Hussein in the 'jects
The coup's up take the new Lame for a sec
12" up, new cane in the deck nigga
Right now with a squeezer in a coozie
And I'm goin out like Keyshia with the uzzi
They talk about it, we all about it
They making plans, we sit and counting
Our cheddar stack it's just like a mountain
You heard about it cause she running her mouth
She want's to ride, and she's trying to hide it
I'm cool as ever, she's too excited
Her man look like, he want to fight
But he ain't doing nothing, but running his mouth
Fuck around and feel the fury of a high nigga
When I get busy throw your hands in the sky nigga
I got the illest of the ill mentality, niggas be grabbing me
Knowing that they'd rather be stabbing me
All up in my back trying to take my track
When I used to sell crack I ain't had problems like that
Street rules, watch your pockets and your jewels
A nigga front, throw the gat to the fool
Next who wanna move is getting blasted
Streets to a flows from the ill ghetto bastard
As I release masterpieces like adhesive
Stuck to your ass, like tissue when your wiping fast
MC's have a hard time believing
I  Marked For Death ,  Hard to Kill  like Steven
When Jake come I'm leaving, the black man's motto
You got a better chance playing lotto
What you want nigga?
Now watch me dip-dip-di-dive all over the beat
Now watch me drip-drip-dri-di all over the street
The general consensus is you'll be the dominating fleet
Bitch raw, and let me continue to bring the heat
You know who been the kings of the block, the kings of the drops
The kings of the crap music and the kings of the cross
Niggas fire then drop shit like the purest of powder
That's why most of these niggas little song be sounding like ours
Couple years ago, niggas probably thought I was dieing
Now same niggas are idolizing put our face in the shrine
Yeah I took a little time to cook and show you what's really hot
How the fuck any of you niggas think you feeling my spot
Why you niggas getting mad at us, we shit on your floors

Y'all better be swift with that punch button Jack
BiggieBiggie
I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray  so you can reminisce
and wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I had to get P-A-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
for chumps tryin to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin to hear it
Smoking mad Newports cause I'm due in court
for an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, cause man
Come and run with me I really wanna show you
How I run the streets I really wanna show you
How I'm clockin G's I really wanna show you
Come and run with me I really wanna show you
I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
with my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, "Who's next?"
I got my honey on the Amtrak
with the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be Lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin black
Sittin back, countin double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up  see what's up with my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
Heard Tec got murdered in a town I never heard of
by some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me, blowing like a bubble 
in the everyday struggle
I'm seeing body after body and our mayor Guiliani
ain't tryin to see no black man turn to John Gotti
Guns and diamonds
Bitches put they tongues where the sun ain't shinin
Take ki's til they spot us, snakes flee with consignment
This kid he got his krib rated, police found grams
They locked up, his whole fam  moms sister his old man
Nigga bailed his moms out, then he told on his man
Now they home, actin like nuttin wrong, hustlin again
He tried to be the next Frank White, and Escobar
Pickin up coke a fiend holds it in a seperate car
Cooks it up til it's bright white, cut it tight right
Then he slings it to the fiends, lookin like Fright Night
Coppin the motorbikes, the scooters, countin dough on computers
High technology dealers, to the users and losers
Half-leg DiDi, try to swap drug for TV's
Stores run out of baking soda from BK to QB
My niggaz die for the cause,  45 on the drawer
City laws made by Big Nas and Biggie Smalls
Bitches, holdin my weight in they titties and drawers
My bitches out of state get bust while they pushin my cars
Callin me up, callin me baller, call for they cut
Pretty hoes bring me my cash, swallow all of this nut
Seats on the Bent' stay nasty, push the dash 
for the stash box is where the cash be  watchin for task force
Cause I know they comin but I'm reachin my goal
Fuck bummin, I'm makin sure I leave this whole game wit somethin
Crib in West Palms for my dime, crib for my moms
Ridiculous, you lookin at the next Nicholas Barnes, baby
Good evenin ladies and gentlemen
How's everybody doin tonite?
I'd like to welcome to the stage, the lyrically acclaimed, ha
I like this young man, because, when he came out
he came out wit the phrase, he went from ashy to classy
Ha, I like that
So everybody in the house, give a warm, round of applause for
The Notorious B I G  ladies and gentlemen give it up for him ya'll
A nigga never been as broke as me, I like that
When I was young I had two pair of Lees, besides that
The pin stripes and the gray 
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt, I'm sewing tigers on my shirt
and alligators
Ya wanna see the inside, huh, I see ya later
Here come the drama, oh, that's that nigga wit the fake, blaow!
Why you punch me in my face, stay in ya place
Play ya position, here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket
Rob him while his friends watchin
That hoes clockin, here comes respect
His crew's your crew, or they might be next
Look at they man eye, BIG man they never try
So we roll wid em, stole wid em
I mean loyalty, niggaz bought me milks at lunch
The milks was chocolate, the cookies, buttercrunch
In gearOshkosh with blue and white ducks
Pass the blunt
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
what you want, pressin what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
what you want, be what you want, have what you want, be what you want
Uh-huh, I was a shame, my crew was lame
I have enough heart for most of em
Long as I got stuff from most of em
It's on, even when I was wrong I got my point across
They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go round
Plus I'm fuckin, bitches ain't my homegirls now
Start stackin, dabbled in crack, gun packin
Nickname Medina, make the seniors tote my ninas
From gym class, to Englass, pass off a global
The only nigga wit a mobile, Can't You See like Total
Gettin larger in waist and taste
Ain't no tellin where this felon is headin, just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of ya melon, clear da space
Ya brain was a terrible thing ta waste
Eighty-eight long gates, snatch initial name plates
Smokin spliffs wit niggaz, real life beginner killers
Prayin God forgive us for being sinners, help us out
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
what you want, pressin what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
what you want, be what you want, have what you want, be what you want
After realizin, to master enterprisin
I ain't have ta be in school by ten, I was in
Began to encounter, wit my counter-parts
On how ta burn the block apart, break it down into section
Drugs by the selection
Some use pipes, others use in-jec-tions
Syringe sold seperately, Frank the deputy
Quick to grab my Smith-n-Wessun, like my dick was missin
To protect my position, my corner, my layer
While we out here, say the hustlas prayer
If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man
Take a better stand
Put money in my moms hand
Get my daughter this college plan, so she don't need no man
Stay far from timid
Only make moves when ya heart's in it
And live the phrase Sky's The Limit
Motherfucker see you chumps on top
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin on
Sky is the limit and you know that you can have
what you want, be what you want
Sky is the limit and you know that you keep on
Just keep on pressin on

No-torious You just heard the sounds of the King of New York
B I G  B I GThere's only one crown 
I don't wanna live no mo'
Sometimes I hear death knockin at my front do'
I'm livin everyday like a hustle, another drug to juggle 
another day, another struggle
I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray  so you can reminisce
and wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out nicks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
for chumps tryin to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin to hear it
Smoking mad Newports cause I'm due in court
for an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, cause man
I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
with my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, "Who's next?"
I got my honey on the Amtrak
with the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be Lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin black
Sittin back, countin double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up  see what's up with my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
Heard Tec got murdered in a town I never heard of
by some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me, blowing like a bubble 
in the everyday struggle
I'm seeing body after body and our mayor Guiliani
ain't tryin to see no black man turn to John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge I'ma mold 'er now
Trick a little dough buyin young girls fringes
Dealin with the dope fiend binges, seein syringes
in the veins  hard to explain, how I maintain
The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
Breakin days on the set, no sweat
Drunk off Moet, can't bag yet because it's still wet
But when that dry, baggin five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashin line
I had the first and the third  rehearse that's my word
Thick in the game, D's knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no! Even though they had me scared
Yo they got a eight, I gotta teck with air holes
and that's just how the shit go in the struggle motherfucker
Junior M A F I A , right yeah
rock on
WOO! Biggie Smalls right 
RING, RING
Hello? Aw shit, nigga What the fuck time is it, man?
Oh god  Nigga do you know what time it is?
Aw shit, what the fuck's goin' on? You alright?
Aw, nigga what the fuck is wrong wit you?
When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies
God will probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies
My babies' mothers 8 months, her little sister's 2
Who's to blame for both of them naw nigga, not you
I swear to God I just want to slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddah head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't,
I can't believe suicide's on my fuckin' mind
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
Naw you wouldn't understand nigga, talk to me please
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone
She knew me and her sista had somethin' goin' on
I reach my peak, I can't speak,
call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak 
I'm sick of niggas lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin',
matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin' 
hey yo big hey yo big
To my motherfuckin' man, fifty grand, the alcholic man
Inject a tall can to his blood stream if he can
Biggie Smalls, the pussy stroker
Emcee prover, the chocolate tah smoker huh?
I like to mack in Maximas and Acuras
But cheeks, I'm smackin' em' huh?
The raw rapper, spot smacker
Wit the lil hooker on my lap-ah, you know your favorite macker
A shy nigga, but I ain't ya fuckin' comforter
And If I ever fall in love, I better fuck it up
Ask the hooker, If I didn't jug her
She try to front, then I put the Chucky Booker on her
Why you wanna play games on me?
Bitch, you crazy? Commitments, I'm Swayze
No time for the ill shit
Mess with the niggaz on that real blood spill shit
My rappin' tactics, are drastic
Stretchin' motherfuckers like Mr  Fantastic
So if you wanna see my Pedigree, you better be
filled with energy, niggaz never gettin' me
Big cities and bright lights
Short days and long nights
No stress and no strife
I'm high off living the life
It's clear to see that I'm the motherfuckin' man, I done learned from the
best of em  Took the first slot, niggaz still second guessin' em
Hoes, I'm undressin' em', foes, I'm not stresin' em'
Outlastin' a bunch of 'em , outflowed the rest of em'
Cuz everyday, I stay preachin' on the pulpit
So tell them haters they could miss me with that bullshit
But I won't miss, I'm Luda, the heat holder
I'm rich, bitch! I've done more shows than Hova
And I'm a soldier, ready for whatever
Roll with a bunch of niggaz that don't know no better
King like Coreddar, countin' mo' cheddar
Just hired two dykes to be my ho getters
When it comes to these women, dog, ain't no one fuckin' wit me
They runnin' back, you think I had TJ Duckett wit me
That's cause I throw it like Vick, from the yard line
Menage a trois, it's safe to say I'm havin' hard times
To my nigga Chopper dot, with the whoopty-whop on the block
Got the heaters cocked, cause I know the suckers on the block
Hennesey and Belve-D, brings a lot of jealousy
Nigga stop snitchin', nephew, why you tellin' me?
They say the game ain't what it use to be on ?
Used to be a G, but now he just a ho
Runnin' 'round poitin' fingers, tellin' names
You fuckin' up the rules to this dirty game, and it's a diry shame
I ain't flippin' out, that's probably why I'm dippin' out
Ya'll fools trippin' out, that why I'm on a different route
Now, makin' money, havin' clout, what's what it's all about
Twenty seven cars and a tweleve bedroom house
Now they call me Snoopy Trump
I keep my heater close, cause I love to bust
Now hat's a stain on a nigga, I bang on a nigga
Kick rocks and watch how I do my thang, young nigga  I'm livin' the life!
I used to get feels on a bitch
Now I throw shields on the dick
To stop me from that HIV shit
And niggaz know they soft like a Twinkie filling
Playin the villian
Prepare for this rap killin
Biggie Smalls is the illest
Your style is played out, like Arnold wondered
"What you talkin bout Willis?"
The thrill is gone, the black Frank White
is here to excite and
throw dick to dykes
Bitches I like em brainless
Guns I like em stainless steel
I want the fuckin Fortune like the Wheel
I squeeze gats till my clips is empty
Man] You don't want to fuck with Biggie
Here I am, I'll beed if this ain't some shit
Come to spread the butter lyrics over hominy grit
It's the low killer death trap, yes I'm a jet black ninja
Comin where you rest at, surrender
Step inside the ring, youse the number one contender
Lookin cold booty like your pussy in December
Nigga stop bitchin, button up ya lip and
From Method all you gettin is a can of ass-whippin
Hey, I'll be kickin, you son, you doin all the yappin
Actin as if it can't happen
You front and got me mad enough to touch somethin
Yo I'm from Shaolin, Island, and ain't afraid to bust somethin
So what cha want nigga, ya punk nigga
I got a six-shooter and a horse named Trigger
It's real, ninety-four, rugged raw
Kickin down your god door and it goes a lil somethin like this
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit
And everything you get ya gotta work hard fot it
Honies shake your hips, ya don't stop
And niggaz pack the clips, keep on
Meth-tical, puttin niggaz back in I C U 
I'm lifted troop, you can bring yours wack ass crew
I got connections, I'll get that ass stuck like glue, huh
No question, I be comin down and shit
Yo I gets rugged as a motherfuckin carpet get
And niggaz love it, not in the physical form but in the mental
I spark and they cells get warm
I'm not a gentle, man, I'm a Method, Man!
Baby accept it, utmost respect it
Assume the position Stop look and listen
I spit on your grave then I grab my Charles Dickens
Welcome to my center
Honies feel it deep in they placenta
Cold as the pole in the winter
Far from the inventor, but I got this rap shit sewed
And when my Mac unloads
I'm guaranteed another video
Ready to die, why I act that way?
Pop Duke left Mom Duke
The faggot took the back way
So instead of makin hoes suck my dick up
I used to do stick-up
Cause hoes is irritatin like the hic-CUPS
Excuse me, flows just grow through me
Like trees to branches
Cliffs to avalanches
It's the praying mantis
Deep like the mind of Farrakhan
A motherfuckin rap phenomenon, plus
I got more glocks and techs than you
I make it hot Nigga won't even stand next to you
Nigga touch me you better bust me
tree times in the head
Or motherfucker's dead, ya thought so
We push the hottest V's, peel fast
through the city, play Monopoly with real cash
Me and Biggie and the models be, shaking they saditty ass
And parotta be, somethin you cats got to see
And the watches be all types and shapes of stones
Bein broke is childish and I'm quite grown
Run up in the club with the ice on, me and Paisan'
Scope the spot out, see somethin nice and I'm gone
You cats is home, screamin the fight's on
I'm in the fifteen hundred seats, watchin Ty-son
Same night, same fight
But one of us cats ain't playin right, I let you tell it
People place yourselves in the shoes of two felons
And tell me you won't ball every chance you get
and any chance you hit, we live for the moment
Makes sense don't it?Now make dollars
Cats pop bottles bone chicks that favor Idalis
and rack up frequent flier mileage
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
I love the dough, more than you know
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
I'm poppin Magnums while Jigga bag somethin
Watch is platinum, got jet lag from
flights back and forth, pop corks of the best grapes
Make the best CD's and the best tapes
Don't forget the vinyl, take girls break spinals
Biggie be Richie like Lionel, shit
You seen the Jesus, dipped to H classes
Ice project off lights, chick flashes
Blind your broke asses, even got rocks in big mustaches
Rock top fashions
Ain't shit changed, except the number after the dot
on the Range, way niggaz look at me now, kinda strange
I hate y'all too
Rather be in Carribean sands with Rachael
It's unreal, out the blue Frank White got sex appeal
Bitches used to go, "Ewww!"
Still tote steel, tryin to see five mil
off the sin-gle, for real
You ain't fazin the amazin
While your gun's raisin, mine is blazin
See you on see me all talkin to sweetness
Take it for weakness and leave quick
Blocker, Roc-a-, Fella, Bad Boy collabo
Two MC's with mad dough, ju' know!
I love the dough, more than you know
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
Miracu-lous, pockets stay full
Niggaz skip the bull cause we matadors
Snatch the P-89's that we pack in the drawers
And we, clappin doors in your Acuras
Snap like, cameras on amateurs
Make you all dance, hold a hammer to yours
Jig and Big rock ice, no cracks or flaws
Erybody got a part to play, back to yours
Run up in your crib now, crack your doors
Watch the real players live, it's a habit to floss
Play the charts like the Beatles, y'all adapt you lost
And toast Cristal on behalf of y'all
Too bad for y'all, ain't too many as bad as yours
truly, do we, we laugh at y'all
Little bastards y'all
We hit makers with acres
Roll shakers in Vegas, you can't break us
Lost chips on Lakers, gassed off Shaq
Country house, tennis courts on horseback
Ridin decidin cracked crab or lobster
Who say mobsters don't prosper
Niggaz is actors, niggaz deserve Oscars
Me I'm, critically acclaimed, slug past your brain
Reminesce on dames who, coochie used to stink
When we rocked house pieces and puffy Gucci links
Now we buy homes in unfamiliar places
Tito smile everytime he see our faces
Cases catch more than outfield-ers
Half these rappin cats, ain't seen war
Couldn't score if they had point game, they lame
Speak my name, I make em dash like Dame
I love the dough, more than you know
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey
"Make it hot"Notorious B I G

We'll just talk about those I knows

Now first come the cash, then come the ass
Then come big blunts with big chunks of hash
When I score with a whore she be game for sure
Pimp so hard, a nigga drag his mink on the floor
Won't you admit it?I ain't gotta talk because I live it
Any chick fuckin with me, believe me that's a privelege
I won't be satisfied, till all my niggaz get it
See you hit it then I hit it, we get it back to split it
And Big be that nigga we be flyin through your hood
And hoodrats scopin with they eyes on my goods
See we date em like we hate em, see em like we don't need em
Treat em like we meet em, and never give up freedom
And we only give our number to selected few
And it's best that you, never knew, what good head'll do
Turn a freak to a bisexual
and if she's flexible fuck the nigga next to you

Y'all still chase on, I'll replace on, punks
Drunk of Dom, silk and gators
Spittin words makin birds till they flock see you later
Whether, drunk or high, skunk or thai
Nigga play against some playa shit, slugs gon fly
Ain't no lie, pimped out, the SSI
Nigga don't ask why, just respect it
She bought me the necklace, the bracelet
The Benz-o, she laced it
Crib-o, got it, interior decorated
Now my popularity grew, in each state

Used to drink brew and eat steak

Street life, pimp shit, make the hoe respect the game
You bought her diamonds and cars, trick that's a shame
Say what you want, but I still figured

than the average symps, found a badder pimp
Too $hort

Bitch only fuckin witchu cause you had a good ass job, nigga nerd
Treat the bitch better than anybody ever treated her
Stupid ass nigga

When I release, you loose teeth like Lil' Cease
Nigga please, blood floods yo' Dungarees
And that's just the half on my warpath
Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater
than the average playa hater, and spectators
buy my CD twice  they see me in the streets
They be like, "Yo he nice, but that's on the low doe"
Be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
I pull out fo'-fo's, and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggaz, snort-caine niggaz
Extortion came quicker, bought the Range nigga
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be
til Lil' Cease crippled me
Now I play hard, like my girls nipples be
The game sour like like a pickle be, y'all know da rules
Move from BK to New Jeruz thinkin bout
all the planes we flew, bitches, we ran through
Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two
Motherfuckers mad cause I blew, niggaz envious
Too many niggaz on my dick, shit strenuous
When my men bust, you just move wit such stamina
Slugs missed ya, I ain't mad at cha we ain't mad at cha
Blood rushin, concussions, ain't nothin
Catch cases, come out frontin, smokin somethin
Sippin White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumpin
I laced it wit the basic, six TV's a system
Knockin Mase shit, face it, we hard to hit
Guard ya shit, 'fore I stick you, for your re-up
Wipe the pee up, mixed shots, woke your seed up
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up, LONG KISS
Y'all can't see this
That this might be the night
This might be the night that's right, that's right
This might be the nightkiss your ass goodbye
Niggaz playin they hands wrong, that's why they won't last long
Finessed, what I was dealt with from the day I was born
While you bent up on that corner, niggaz plottin and scheamin
Up in them little holes, be creepin wit mad demons
Niggaz knows, not to fuck with my dough
Niggaz know not to fuck with this little bro I'm ten seconds hit'n'go
Black mask black truck chrome rims Chuck Timbs
Enough to confuse, any witness
Strongest of calibers, is what we only travel wit
You gotta get hit, your man did, so you got a hand in it
Extort y'all, once friends, now we gotta cross y'all
You know the niggaz with the biggest balls set the new laws
and flip fours, have em washin drawers while you up North
Gat to your jugular, getting your salad tossed
Overhearin niggaz situation, sayin, "Like we thought"
Sittin on the stand with no remorse
Yo, yo how we do niggaz, I don't beef I shoot niggaz
If I can't get the main character, a few niggaz then
I don't need no gin to boost me
I got enough steam to blow, somebody gotta go
I got fire in my heart, guns in my car
Cash in my Carharts, it ain't hard to get em 
like blaow when I hit em, the nigga shit his drawers
when the 40-pound hit him, the fuck these niggaz thought?
Could it be the fame, maybe it's the 2 Benz or
would it be the same if I couldn't claim those?
Fuckin with, hoes ??
Cock sucker beat it while you bleed it on the dashboard
Niggaz get, what they hand call for, again bricks
You get deaded, I get erections, over revenge
Can you get a quiet spot in the shade, for a breeze
I lay a nigga down and steam roll away ??
I never thought it would be like this
Always thought you would be here
Always thought you would be by my side
I never thought it'd be like this
OH GOD I MISS YOU!C'MON!YEA!
It goes B to the I to the G so proper
Missy and Big Poppa Check it out
Call us chief knockers
Damn Ma, I love you like the lah, the ganja
Sensimilla, can I feel ya
All I wanna do is touch ya
The ultimate rush, you're drugs baby
Don't you know I'm the ultimate? To get this nookie, be fortunate
Just like tastin pussy with pork in it
People stop when I'm walkin in, I'm twist-in twistin 'em
Back on ten, I'm talkin 'bout like when Mase come back again
My ski's is immaculate, my paper stackin keep trackin
I'm mackin yo slackin, reaction makes ya'll dicks grin
I'm mo' better than gold diggers with figures
Mo' bigger than Jigga's and even Paris Hilton's
Damn sir, sniff me like the coke, three lines, me one, give you none
Sent amilia, all you wanna do is sniff me
The ultimate rush, get high baby
Damn sir, sniff me like the coke, three lines, me one, give you none
Sent amilia, all you wanna do is sniff me
The ultimate rush, the drugs baby
Now Biggie Smalls is not the type to fall in love with 'em
Hit 'em and forget 'em and go handle my business
I like the kind of whine and dine, who grindin all the time
Yo ex girl was a fly, but now lucked up on a dime, nigga
What is it with you, all you wanna do is lay around
And stay around and get mad when I play around
I like to lay never work, put your money in my purse
To the mall, I go search matchin shoes for my skirt
Tuesday I saw you on the zee, but you still wanna get wit me
Wednesday is the Benz day, that's what your friends say
Me and my friends got your Benz, attractin mens
And spendin dividends, blowin like the wind
So I guess you think I'm slippin cause I ain't flippin
Baby, I'm Big Poppa, ain't no need to be trippin
I ain't trippin nor flippin, I'm just liquor sippin
At the bar, tippin wit your money, can you pay the difference?
It seems like it's a waiste of time, that's why I wrote the rhyme
I hear you jump in every car, except for mines
Nigga, I don't jump in cars, I'm a super star
Face way to flaw, you should hang me on your wall
All I do all day is drink Tanqueray
Thinking of a way to put a smile on your face
Make me smile, see them teeth, me look cute down to them features
My waste, my physique, me don't want freak-a-leek
Should I wine and dine? You put ring on your fingers
While sex from the next man in the bedroom lingers
Sex will never linger, hold up, put up the blinkers
I flow just like sprinklers, give yo ass the middle finger
You better slow your role baby, you ain't got enough dough to pay me
You know the pin number, just page me when you will baby
Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
Representin BK to the fullest
Gats I pull it, bastards duckin when Big be buckin
Chickenheads be cluckin in my bathroom fuckin
It ain't nuttin, they know Big be handlin
with the mac in the Ac' door paneling
Bandaging MC's, oxygen they can't breathe
Mad tricks up the sleeve, wear boxers so my dick can breathe
Breeze through in the Q-45 by my side, lyrical high
And those that rushes my cluthes get put on crutches
Get smoked like dutches from the master
Hate to blast ya, but I have ta, you see I smoke a lot
Your life is played out like Kwame, and them fuckin polka dots
Who rock the spot?Biggie!
You know how the weed go, unbelievable
B-I-G, G-I-E, AKA, B I G 
Get it? Biggie
Also known as the bon appetit
Rappers can't sleep need sleepin Big keep creepin
Bulelts heat-seekin, casualties need treatin
Dumb rappers need teachin
Lesson Adon't fuck with B-I, that's that
Oh I, thought he was wack  oh come come now
Why y'all so dumb nowhunt me or be hunted
I got three hundred and fifty-seven ways
to simmer sautee, I'm the winner all day
Lights get dimmer down Biggie's hallway
My forte causes caucausians to say
He sounds demented, car weed scented
If I said it, I meant it
Bite my tongue for no-one
Call me evil, or unbelievable
Buck shots out the sun roof of Lexus Coupes
Leave no witnesses, what you think this is
Ain't no amateurs here, I damage and tear
MC's fear me, they too near not to hear me
Clearly, I'm the triple beam dream
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut
It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill
Tryin to play gorilla, when you ain't no killer
The gat's by your liver, your upper lip quiver
Get ready to die, tell God I said hi
And throw down some ice, for the nicest MC
Niggaz know the steelo, unbelievable
What you expected from his next of kin
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin
The lesson from the Smith and Wessun is depressin
Niggaz keep stressin, the same motherfuckin question
How many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
and my body start to shake, if I should die before I wake
I'm here, I'm watching you if I should die before I wake
Love, the flesh, my blood's pourin through if I should die before I wake
This, can be, reality if I should die before I wake
Wake, up, my dead face I see if I should die before I wake
My dead face I see, my dead face I SEE!!
On your mark, get set, when I spark you're wet
Look how dark it get when you're marked wit death
Should I, start your breath or should I let you die
If he start to cry, ask why?
Lyrically, I'm worshipped, don't front, the word's sick
You cursed it, but rehearsed it
I drop unexpectedly like bird shit
You herbs get, stomped quickly for raw T's and show money
Don't forget the publishin, I'm punishin
I'm done wit them, son I'm surprised you run wit them
I think they got cumin, cause they nothin but bitch
Tryna blow up like nitro wit dynamite sticks
Mad I smoke, but yo I rock diamonds that's sick
Got paper off my flow, ride wit my own click
Take chicks to Cairo, layin wit yo' bitch
I know you playin you was rich
Fuck you prick, when I see you I'ma
I am here, I'm watching you when I see you I'ma
Love, the flesh, my blood's pourin through when I see you I'ma
This, can be, reality when I see you I'ma
Wake, up, my dead face I see when I see you I'ma
My dead face I see when I see you I'ma, my dead face I SEE!!
When I see you I'mawhen I see you I'ma
Uh yeah, Bad Boy baby
Biggie Smalls
Listen 
Uh yeah baby oooooooh, listen to me, oh yeaaaah
When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the thriller in Manila
Honeys call me Bigga the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the ep along by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I'm in thirteens, know what I mean
I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessey dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder, it doesn't matter
Skinny or fat or boy-skinned or black, baby I drop
These boricua mommies screamin "Ay papi!"
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled propa
Look, I gotcha caught up in the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote da fo'-fo'
For niggaz gettin mad cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G ya see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Gettin Physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So gimme a hoe, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her till her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-town in ya, you'll want that old thing back

Cause I only be knowin how the shit's unfolded
Back shots to the rear, got the mac unloaded
Got a reload, like every so often
You sayin I got my swagger back

It's so hard pressed, to be impressed by these new rappers
They actors, and the fact is, you want that old thing back
Shit 
Is my mind playin tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, havin nightmares of girls killin me
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past let's dwell on the 500 SL, the E and J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rim with Benjamins
Another hon's in the crib, please send her in
I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits alot
But lickin clits had to stop
Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow, really though
I got the cleanest meanest penis, ya never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Tim boots and your bodysuit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex gettin rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker

and if I'm caressin em, I'm undressin em

For fillin fantasies without that nigga Mr  Walk
Or Tattoo I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I'm done I got to split shit

Jacked her then I asked her who's the man  she said, "B-I-G"
Then I bust in her E-Y-E Yo Big, you're dead wrong

Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the icepick
because he wanted me to fuck him from the back

Got your father hidin in a room  fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound

Anybody step into my path is fuckin feelin it!
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab ya til you're gushy, so please don't pushme

The black demon, got the little hookers screamin
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
with no hair in between, know what I mean?
I don't care what nobody say
Ladies and gentlemen
There's several different levels to Devil worshippin: horse's heads,
human sacrifices, canibalism  candles and exorcism
Animals havin sex with 'em  camels mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that, I kick the habitI just,
beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fuckin, meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin, I got a nine in my pocket
and baby I'm just, dyin to cock him
He's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
My uz' as, heavy as yours, yeah you met me before

Marshall will step in the door, I lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall

Met on the second, wet on the third 
then she's dead on the fourthI'm dead wrong

Do you ever ask yourself, when are they gonna stop making those hits?
Do you ever ask yourself, when are they gonna stop making us dance?
When those Bad Boy are GONNA STOP MAKING ALL THIS MONEY?!
I lick shots at intruders
Take the coke money and invest in computers
Tryin' to reach the next level, Rolex with the ice bezel
Coming through the ghetto, in a Porsche Carrero
But for now I'll play the back of the cruiser
Light another sack for the three time losers
Pour out some beer, bust out the ruger
Ladies and gentleman
Bullets will leave you tremblin, shooken up
I got my cuban mommy cooking up
We got it all from Heron to Fishscale
New York to Ismail get locked, I'm gettin' bail
My style is flashy like a fiver strobes
Going around the globe, hunnies wearing silk robes
Time to flip the script, bust the whip
Legend with the chip, dark blue with my trunk dipped
To the feds, catch me if you can
I'm a still transport with my man on the Peter Pan
Get there and bury the bricks in the sand
They think I want a tan, I'm sittin' on a hundred grand
So I can hit the boat and take a shower
Head back to the airport, and hide the money in the tower
Stack blocks by the keys
L to the O to the X you'll see
Bad Boy, Bad Boy, what you gonna do
What you gonna do when they come for you
Gun cocking You'll see, gun cocking you'll se
See, it's 1996 man,
And we gonna do the same thing to you we did to you in '95
We gonna keep hittin' you in your head with all that
Yeah aight then, you better act like you know
L to the O, X amount the flows
Ain't nothin' change but the range since I got the inf 
Dot on your head, take all your strength
Yeah, I'm in it for the green
I'll get up in your seam while I'm sonning you like a nigga from Queens
My tape in your duel cassette running me
Tryin' to get in front of me playa, but you ain't gettin' none of me
Better off gunnin' me, with hot slugs numbing me
'Cause you and I both know, the flow is coming B
When you want it? now or later?
I get mine and slide like a fresh pair of 'gators
With my mega click, involved in Montega bricks
Niggaz is mega sick, and you know we roll mega thick
Up north where they bust your man
In the custom van, interrupt your plans
Now it's back to grams, DAMN, ain't that somethin'
All that for frontin', what you gonna do? nothin'
So let's keep things rationalized
Everything I write better nationalize
I'm into gettin' money, twistin' hunnies
Niggaz is buyin' coupes while you on the stoop lookin' funny
I'm a scorer, shorty love the whole aura
Pussy wasn't all that, that's why I never called her
It's all about quick whips and fast knicks
Gats with mad clips, TV's in your whips
My style tight like Gotti when I touch you
Seasoned Picatti, or Versace joints with the buckle
Get the facts, I'm tryin' to get the Beamer with the hatch
Cop one for my man, so ill shits match
Runnin' around all crazy twistin' hunnies back
And breakin' niggaz that come to gamble with small stacks
Really though, screw y'all, I never knew y'all
Your click be like yellow lights, I'm runnin' through y'all
Yo, hard as it is to make a buck I ain't tryin' to get stuck
So I'm a keep handlin' beef like I don't give a fuck
It's all about respect Tek-9's and papes
Big house in Italy, in the yard with hunnies crushin' grapes
So I go down to my steam room and give a long prayer
Knowing that one day I'll be Sheek Luchion the mayor
Fatigued out in my house or office
Blunt spots and crooked cops can't grow shit so the town supports this
My staff rollin' in Jags, Cruisers, and Coupes
Givin' rallies, and holdin' parades for the lifers groups
Now what you gon' do?
When they come for you
The same thing you been doing
Eye screwing
And bubble gum chewing whoooh
While me and my mans are pursuin'
Who you think the ladies are enhancin'
Rocking Vansons I'm dancing in the mansion
So cheers to life of the ice in your chains and your watches
And you'll see how wo lock this
Click, click, uh, uh, uh
Niggaz talkin' it but ain't livin' it
Crystal pops I'm sippin' it, mob hats and lizard shit
'Gator trunks bitch, rollin' blunts with the williest of the willy
Heckler Koch, M-1's and nine millies
Stories like a motherfucker that's right
Model bitches wondering if I'm a fuck with her
She know I treats my bitches like Ivana
Dolce and Gabana
Dippin'
Big poppa never slippin'
H-class diamonds shinin'
Dinner with the wifey winin', dinin'
Smoking cigars in Bogota
With Colombian niggaz named Panama
And Englique and shit
Games we play life endin'
Bitches bending over with ease
For a pair of Moschino jeans
And Donna Karan tank tops I got your bank stopped
Singles on top
Benjamins
Under the rest of 'em
Advancin'
From duplex to mansion
Stashing keys hidin' G's overseas
VCR's in my V's
Game elevates, money I make
Gets your stocks and real estates, bitch
Jet skiing in the Caribean, white sands
Discusing plans with my mans
Dark blue land, smoke tint chrome rims and system
That leaves your rear views tremblin'
What you gonna do when poppa catch an attitude
Drop to your knees and show gratitude
Kiss my rings it's a Frank White thing I stay potent
Bitch is devoted, take my dick and deep throat it
You'll see Don't stop, you'll see, you'll s
