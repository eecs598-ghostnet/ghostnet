yeah  i know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now 
but hey  what d daddy always tell you  straighten up  little soldier  stiffen up that upper lip  what you cryin  about  
you got me

hailie  i know you miss your mom  and i know you miss your dad
when i m gone  but i m tryin  to give you the life that i never had
i can see you re sad  even when you smile  even when you laugh
i can see it in your eyes  deep inside you wanna cry
 cause you re scared  i ain t there
daddy s with you in your prayers
no more cryin   wipe them tears
daddy s here  no more nightmares

we gon  pull together through it
we gon  do it  lainie uncle s crazy  ain t he 
yeah  but he loves you  girl  and you better know it
we re all we got in this world  when it spins  when it swirls
when it whirls  when it twirls  two little beautiful girls
lookin  puzzled  in a daze  i know it s confusin  you
daddy s always on the move  momma s always on the news

i try to keep you sheltered from it  but somehow it seems
the harder that i try to do that  the more it backfires on me
all the things growin  up as daddy that he had to see
daddy don t want you to see  but you see just as much as he did
we did not plan it to be this way  your mother and me
but things have got so bad between us  i don t see us ever bein 
together ever again  like we used to be when we was teenagers
but then  of course  everything always happens for a reason
i guess it was never meant to be  but it s just something
we have no control over  and that s what destiny is

but no more worries  rest your head and go to sleep
maybe one day we ll wake up and this ll all just be a dream

now hush little baby  don t you cry
everything s gonna be alright
stiffen that upper lip up  little lady  i told ya
daddy s here to hold ya through the night
i know mommy s not here right now  and we don t know why
we feel how we feel inside
it may seem a little crazy  pretty baby
but i promise  momma s gon  be alright 

it s funny  i remember back one year when daddy had no money
mommy wrapped the christmas presents up and stuck  em under the tree
and said some of  em were from me  cause daddy couldn t buy  em
i ll never forget that christmas  i sat up the whole night cryin 
 cause daddy felt like a bum see  daddy had a job
but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom

and at the time  every house that we lived in
either kept gettin  broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
and your mom was savin  money for you in a jar
tryin  to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
almost had a thousand dollars   til someone broke in and stole it
and i know it hurt so bad it broke your momma s heart
and it seemed like everything was just startin  to fall apart
mom and dad was arguin  a lot  so momma moved back
on to chalmers in the flat  one bedroom apartment
and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on novara
and that s when daddy went to california with his cd
and met dr dre and flew you and momma out to see me
but daddy had to work  you and momma had to leave me
then you started seein  daddy on the tv  and momma didn t like it
and you and lainie were too young to understand it
papa was a rolling stone  momma developed a habit

and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
i m just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
 cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud
now i m sittin  in this empty house
just reminiscin   lookin  at your baby pictures  it just trips me out
to see how much you both have grown  it s almost like you re sisters now
wow  guess you pretty much are  and daddy s still here
lainie  i m talkin  to you too  daddy s still here
i like the sound of that  yeah  it s got a ring to it  don t it 
sshh  momma s only gone for the moment

and if you ask me to  daddy s gonna buy you a mockingbird
i ma give you the world
i ma buy a diamond ring for you  i ma sing for you
i ll do anything for you to see you smile
and if that mockingbird don t sing and that ring don t shine
i ma break that birdie s neck
i ll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
and make him eat every carat  don t fuck with dad
