pump it up  just throw yo hands in the air
this goes out to all my niggaz that don t dare
i got a whole lot of diamonds in yo veins
about havin thangs gold rings  and my platinum chain
that s why all these bitch  ass niggaz get smoked
they don t give a fuck  that shit ain t no joke
nigga this goes out to all them crooked ass cops
since back in the days when i was getting popped
always had a good time for me to be fine
i ve lost my mind  and i m still gon shine
but i don t wanna see a nigga on the grind
we ain t trying to be ready for war or crime
check this out  a lot of people are scarred
and it s my time when it comes to the stars
cause i was born with a house full of bricks
yeah  we can see it all in the mix
but now it s hard for me to beg and feed
i gotta wake up  so take away my seed

but right now i m just trying to make it nice
this is my life  you can pay the price
i ain t gotta wait til it s time to take flight
have a party all night  everything s gonna be alright
so now do you really wanna get with me tonight
it ain t no need to talk about what i write

and i ma let you know that my game is thick
this rap shit  i do it for the bricks
cause none of y all niggas can t fuck with my click
you know we ain t got no time for these tricks
so don t be mad cause the whole world is fake
it s a part of me  i ll do whatever i takes

ain t no need for us to do what we want
there s nothing in the world that can make me feel so sweet
i be out here tryin to get my hustle on
kept it real when they see me in the street
cause there s no way that i ve been on my grind
but sometimes  i just wanna get out of control
feel like i m the only one that s on my mind
and nobody wants to be a part of their soul

cause i don t wanna be  no more  i m like 
so i can go hard  i m in the club 
i ain t got no time for a minute 
i can see my mama with her 
i can see what i can do 
i do my thing  i ain t been around 
but you didn t know  but now i know i know 
i ain t wanna  then i call him 
she said she was a bitch  she ain t gonna make it
yeah  i m just tryin to catch me on the street
and get caught up in my pocket full of weed
you think it s time for me to feel the breeze
i ma put your ass in a pocket full of cheese
there s a place in my heart  i promise it will never end
but it s so hard for me to be the world s best friend
fuck that bitch  i love it when you suck my dick
i m bout to get caught up in the heart of a chick

yeah  i m just tryin to catch me on the street
and get caught up in my pocket full of weed
you think it s time for me to feel the breeze
i ma put your ass in a pocket full of cheese

there s a place in my heart  i promise it will never end
but it s so hard for me to be the world s best friend
fuck that bitch  i love it when you suck my dick
i m bout to get caught up in the heart of a chick

ain t none of these niggas tryin to fuck with me
i need a bitch  just give me some pussy
and you know that i ve been all over this globe
cause back in the days when i was sellin dope
and that s how we do it all over this world
but you should know  i wanna be your girl

this the type of shit that i m lookin for bro
and when it come to my hood  they call me solo
cause i came a long way from the danger zone
don t be hating on me when i m in my dome
i ll be right back in the heart of a ghost
i m that nigga from north  east to west coast
yeah  cause you know we came to party tonight
so throw your hands up in the air if it s alright
we can go and get a piece of that fence
you need to slow down  it don t make no sense
i grab the mic and a pocket full of beats
now let me show you how to make ends meet
cause i know that you was down with me today
but now it s time to come and get it ok
don t want no money  i gotta make a mil
everytime you see me in the back of my grill
i m just tryin to take a look at this ho
but when i hit the flo  we make it glow
yo  i remember when we used to do shows
been around the world and that s just how it goes
