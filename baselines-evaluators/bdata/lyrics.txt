i want a girl with extensions in her hair
bamboo earrings at least two pair
a fendi bag and a bad attitude
thats all i need to get me in a good mood
she can walk with a switch and talk with street slang
i love it when a woman aint scared to do her thing
standing at the bus stop sucking on a lollipop
once she gets pumping its hard to make the hottie stop
she likes to dance to the rap jams
she sweet as brown sugar with the candied yams
honey coated complexion using camay
lets hear it for the girl shes from around the way

silky milky her smile is like sunshine
thats why i had to dedicate at least one rhyme
to all the cuties in the neighborhood
cause if i didnt tell you then another brother would
youre sweet like sugar with your gangster talk
want to eat you like a cookie when i see you walk
with your rayon silk or maybe even denim
it really doesnt matter as long as youre in em
perm in your hair or even a curly weave
witcha new edition bobby brown button on your sleeve
i tell you come here you say meet me half way
cause brothers been popping that game all day
around the way youre like a neighborhood jewel
all the homeboys sweat you so youre crazy cool
wear your gold in the summer with your biking shorts
while you watching all the brothers on the basketball court
going to the movies with your homegirls crew
while the businessmen in suits be hawking you
baby hair pumping lip gloss is shining
i think you in the mood for wining and dining
so we can go out and eat somewhere
we got a lot of private jokes to share
lisa angela pamela renee
i love you youre from around the way


if its a malleable beat subject of discussion
youre motivated with the aid of percussion
theres no category for this story
it will rock in any territory
i syncopate it and design it well
the beat elevates the scratch excels
all techniques are a combination
of skills that i have for narration

lacking a melody but still complete
providing musical energy for the street
lyrics are smooth for maximum effect
drum track patterns are pre set
tom toms snare hats bass and cymbal
like that of a cat on the mic im nimble
basic patterns groups and chains
sequence frequent seek and gain

im in the center of a musical scorcher
to some citizens its a form of torture
they hear me they fear me my funky poetry
im improvin the conditions of the rap industry
the beat expands to many foreign lands
germany italy france and japan
itll give you a lift no need to sniff
no buts no hows no whys or ifs
its you i defeated theyll say you retreated
pick up your favorite magazine and read it
rap firepower a musical shower
a picture of me on the eiffel tower

during this journey im your escort
youre bein protected by a musical fort
im infiltrating your eardrums
increasing their rate of vibration
i wanna rock ya thats all you need to know
i need a beat is the title of the show
providing you with pleasure of the musical measures
all arranged to alleviate pressure
im your vocalist your party therapist
beat programmer and lyricist
ladies love cool j studio user
a million or more screamin people abuser
i predict this jam will hit
the highest plateau in the world of music
paparazzi wealth and fame
the total propulsion of my name

computerize then the engineers eyes
have to be very acute education level high
the product is mine beat under rhyme
the control boards part of the studio design
track after track culminating on wax
the tape has slack rewind spins back
expensive but useful the music is the fuel
a perfect place for mcs to duel


going back to cali stylin profilin
growlin and smilin while in the sun
the top is down on the black corvette
and its fly cause its sittin on daytons
nardi steering wheel plushed out gold leaf phantom top
and three girls waiting
vrroom engines blowin the chrome is shining
passing all the cars on the way
movement of the wind back wheels spin
pop in a cassette and push play

im going back to cali shakin em bakin em
takin em to spots they never before hung
 the place on sunset its a trip
where the acs cold and the girls still strip
the record skip but this girl kept dancin
prancin grindin grinnin romancin
i asked her to the barn so we could hit the hay
i wanna do this brutus but i dont wanna pay

im going back to cali rising surprising
advising realizing shes sizing me up
her bikini   small heels   tall
she said she liked the ocean
she showed me a beach gave me a peach
and pulled out the suntan lotion
now i thought that was fast but this girl was faster
shes lookin for a real good time
i said close your eyes i got a surprise
and i ran away with the bottle of wine


it was harlem at the ruckers i saw with your man
smilin huh a coach bag in your hand
i was layin in the coupe with my hat turned back
we caught eyes for a moment and that was that
so skated off as you strolled off
lookin at them legs god damn they looked so soft
i gotta take ya from your man thats my mission
if his love is real he got ta handle competition
you only knew him five months
besides he drink too much and smoke too many blunts
and i be workin out everyday thinkin bout you
looking at my own eyes in the rear view
cathchin flash backs of our eye contact
wish i could lay ya on your stomach and caress your back
i would hold ya in my arms and ease your fears
i cant believe it i hadnt had a crush in years
hey lover

i see you at the bus stop waitin everyday
your man must think its safe for you to travel that way
but i dont want ta violate your relationship
so i lay back in the cut with a crush thats a trip
still he cant stop me from having daydreams
tonguin you down with uh vanilla ice cream
kissing on your thighs in the moonlight
searchin your body with my tongue girl all night
i wonder one day could it be simple dreams turnin into reality
our love would come down so naturally
we would walk down the aisle of destiny
what your man got his hustle on gotcha type scared
last week i saw ya at the mall
standin at the pay phone bout to make a call
i had a vision it was me on the other end
tellin you come by and then you walked in
i touched you gently with my hands
we talked about travelin the distant lands
escapin all the madness out here in the world
becomin my wife no longer my girl
then you let your dress fall down to the floor
i kissed you softly and you yearned for more
we experienced pleasure unparallel
into an ocean of love we both fell
swimmin in the timeless currents of pure bliss
fantasies interchangin with each kiss
undyin passion unities our souls
together we swim until the point of no control but
its a fantasy it  wont come true
we never even spoke and your man swear he love you
so im a keep all these feelins inside
keep my dreams alive until the right time

heres your token back youre gettin off at the next stop
ima deliver and give a speech with vigor
i drink some olde e and start waxin


when im alone in my room sometimes i stare at the wall
and in the back of my mind i hear my conscience call
telling me i need a girl whos as sweet as a dove
for the first time in my life i see i need love
there i was giggling about the games
that i had played with many hearts and im not saying no names
then the thought occured tear drops made my eyes burn
as i said to myself look what youve done to her
i can feel it inside i cant explain how it feels
all i know is that ill never dish another raw deal
playing make believe pretending that im true
holding in my laugh as i say that i love you
saying amor kissing you on the ear
whispering i love you and ill always be here
although i often reminsce i cant believe that i found
a desire for true love floating around
inside my soul because my soul is cold
one half of me deserves to be this way till im old
but the other half needs affection and joy
and the warmth that is created by a girl and a boy

romance sheer delight how sweet
i gotta find me a girl to make my life complete
you can scratch my back well get cozy and huddle
ill lay down my jacket so you can walk over a puddle
ill give you a rose pull out your chair before we eat
kiss you on the cheek and say ooh girl youre so sweet
its deja vu whenever im with you
i could go on forever telling you what i do
but where you at youre neither here or there
i swear i cant find you anywhere
damn sure you aint in my closet or under my rug
this love search is really making me bug
and if you know who you are why dont you make yourself seen
take the chance with my love and youll find out what i mean
fantasies can run but they cant hide
and when i find you im gon pour all my love inside

i wanna kiss you hold you never scold you just love you
suck on you neck caress you and rub you
grind moan and never be alone
if youre not standing next to me youre on the phone
cant you hear it in my voice i need love bad
ive got money but loves something ive never had
i need your ruby red lips sweet face and all
i love you more than a man whos ten feet tall
id watch the sunrise in your eyes
were so in love when we hug we become paralyzed
our bodies explode in ecstasy unreal
youre as soft as a pillow and im as hard as steel
its like a dream land i cant lie i never been there
maybe this is an experience that me and you can share
clean and unsoiled yet sweaty and wet
i swear to you this is something ill never forget

see what i mean ive changed im no longer
a playboy on the run i need something thats stronger
friendship trust honor respect admiration
this whole experience has been such a revelation
its taught me love and how to be a real man
to always be considerate and do all i can
protect you youre my lady and you mean so much
my body tingles all over from the slightest touch
of your hand and understand ill be frozen in time
till we meet face to face and you tell me youre mine
if i find you girl i swear ill be a good man
im not gonna leave it in destinys hands
i cant sit and wait for my princess to arrive
i gotta struggle and fight to keep my dream alive
ill search the whole world for that special girl
when i finally find you watch our love unfurl


its the first time together and im feeling kinda horny
conventional methods of makin love kinda bore me
i wanna knock your block off get my rocks off
blow your socks off make sure your g spots soft

back for the payback i must say that
i heard your new jam i dont play that
it aint loud enough punk it aint hitting
this year you tried next year youre quitting
last year you thought i was dying out
but again and again and again without a doubt
its the gangster boogie the earthquake sound
pump it up and play it so they hear it all around
i do it up rough tough i dont bluff
and this is an example of funky stuff
when you wanna make hits you make em like this
they aint like this they dont hit they miss
its a strong record a record for the strong
for those who appreciate real rap songs

aiming to please while im killing emcees
im gonna keep on hitting you with rough lps
day after day after day
youre smacked in the face by the bass of cool j
im  

jack the ripper the baddest around

im a beast on the microphone a night stalker
a killing machine a savage street talker
jason with an axe but i put it on wax
to eradicate the suckers who thought i had relaxed
the prince of hip hop straight from queens
kicking it mean keeping it clean
and youve never seen anybody rock the party
all you funky beat aholics this beats bacardi
i go to the show and terrorize emcees dont you know
moving my hand like im playing the piano
dont touch the dial dont change the channel
dont let me hear you say i aint debonair
im better than any emcee out there
as a matter of fact suckers cant compare
when im rocking the mic people stop and stare at


i was at the mall sipping on a milkshake
i went to the high school about three oclock
to try to catch a cutie riding my jock
my homeboys jeep the system blasting
cold forty dogs smiling and laughing
girls all over the kind i adore
i felt like a kid in a candy store
thats when i seen her her name was brenda
she had the kind of booty that id always remember
i said to my man stop the jeep
shes only seventeen but yo dont sleep
i kicked the bass like an nfl punter
and scoped the booty like a big game hunter
i said to the girl yo you look tired
lets go get some rest relax by the fire
i put the big booty on a bearskin rug
she gave me a kiss i gave her a hug
i said to the girl them young boys aint nothing
you want to get freaky let me kiss your belly button
i circled it and teased it and made her squeal
grabbed a pack of bullets and pulled out the steel
when i was through i wiped the sweat from my eyes
when to the kitchen and got some sweet potato pies
tina busted in my house while i was eating
you know what i said
too bad you caught me cheating but

i went to red lobster for shrimp and steak


knock knock  whos there
the one remember me
im lookin kinda different these days dont you agree
your boys going big these days didnt even see
the hell with the devil theres no sympathy
the wishes in my past are still ridin me
all i can do is laugh as they lie to me
you cant take my god from inside of me
crosses up light up the sky with me
i got a lot of crazy crazy on my mind
like whats the real reason that the pope resigned
i got van halen i dont need a bassline
i knew we can do it it was just a matter of time
im on a hacksaw tour eddie got a frankenstein aimed at your door
speakers under the stage lift you off of the floor
why this music is the end to the war
we endure cameras everywhere everyone is keeping score
everybody talkin bout whats up bout the tour
the world is a steak im a chew it up raw
were back in heavy metal like we above the law
london japan germany and france
lisbon to new york were live up in netherlands
jump up on some shoulders baby you never dance

staring at your arches while your flip flop stable
nagging me reminding me to remain true

thats why i pull back dont speak no rap

everybody knows that falling in loves easy timing outs hard
so the only one who really knows my thoughts is god
its crazy i hold you in the highest regard
but us having true love whats the odds
thats scary what if i get hit that hard

when your hearts on fire and about to melt

toast to the gold my heart dont lose


ll  grown up man
couldnt give a damn if a young boys my fan
long as his mama two step to my jam
while she cleanin up her house mop in her hand
its how i changed the game now you understand
i got that old money weak rubber bands
cats playin themselves getting out of hand
show two features to chase teenage fans
well i got it right i cram to understand
how you trendy shorty ls a brand
raised on hip hop the grownup fans
hands in the air rocking in a stance

aw yeah  

youre in every breath that i take
every dream that i dream every move that i make
my love never sleeps every moment its awake
my heart shines like moonlight on the lake
my soul was in prison but you helped it escape
toned down the ego mimimize the hate
you add to the magic i was put in to create
you make my vision clearer when i cant see straight
show me parts of my life that i need to eliminate
yet and still so many times i didnt demonstrate
the love that i feel i wasnt bein real
i did so many things you wouldnt appreciate
baby girl when youre standin on this big rock flyin through space
havin experiences we could never replace
deep scars on our hearts that are hard to erase
a thorn in your side i can see it on ya face
and every time we hug it hurts in the same place
so you build up walls to protect you just in case
i tried to climb over but i fell on my face
i tried to dig beneath it but i couldnt penetrate
saw a crack in my wall that raised the stakes
bright light shine through help me to find you
illuminated the inner divine you
a room with no walls i cant define you
too many thoughts to force my mind through
but if it hits the fan im right behind you
or youre beside me hearts wide open and free
a love is the key


hands up hands up
hands up slip into the bath salt

never cus i have to
its because im a bastard
and i got the game mastered
ear drums dealing with harassment
we back to the basement
hand on my nuts thats product placement
the game lost its flavor i wonder where the taste went
i said i wonder where the taste went
slip into the bath salt
push it real good

uh boss of all bosses
face in the car make a young girl noxious
yea this beat salad when i toss this
never go against me you lack resources
what i skywalk with the forces
back in the eightys i was playin in porsches
money aint a problem i toll my losses
maserati coup take galloping horses
nah theres never been one like me
theyre looking for a new me as if there might be
even with a love song thats unlikely
if l aint the dope may lightning strike me
uh killin queens all day
i got what you want what you willin to pay
your boy ladies love sound clean on the track
slip into the bath salt wash my back come on


honestly i was scared to come back
it was ugly not knowing how the game would react
said my old gym teacher he supposed to rap
but now i teach class put back tony
you see it in my eyes transparent like glass
giving all for my soul to have another smash
yea ll cool j
thirty years later be me for a day
same day just a daddy she love me anyway
so i told er what to read and i showed er how to pray
cats on my team got nba
but its my black from the web we stay
i dont whack my suicides i act my age
never try to sound like a rapper i raised
roared as a tiger cant grow no brains
but the moneys coming in in three point zero ways


lookin kinda salty over there
theys are kinda salty over there


ill be by your side when the chips are down
i know you had some problems but im here now
youll never be alone long as im around
good hearts dont belong in the lost and found
so i pick up the pieces erase your frown
and i show my true colors when we paint the town
i hate to hear you cry i dont like the sound
so my love is turned up sheets get turned down
i know it hurts now the dramas the worst now
its fourth and a hundred but loves a first down
a quarterback to come back right now
when a hail mary works the world is like wow
you down for the count i aint having it baby
they can all go to hell i know they calling me crazy
but youre my sunshine when the world gets shady
a toast to the first lady


turn your back on it and the sun still shines
grapes get old and they turn into wine
the deeper the roots the stronger the vines
these lines on my face just a sign of the times
you could cry on my shoulder if youre so inclined
i used to be a casanova in the lunch room line
now theres more important things occupying my mind
like being there for you breathing the air for you
do trust falls and truth or dare for you
the weight of the world im prepared to bear for you
the haters get cynical and call you spoiled
not knowing about the drama in which you embroiled
the numerous pit falls the tussle and the toil
but farmers taught me to put seeds in the soil
and here comes the harvest this parts the hardest
im still here regardless


i wont tell nobody baby you can trust me
you swearin that its good im thinkin it must be
im kissin on your thighs relax dont rush me
let me take my time make your pretty face ugly
hands by your side stop tryin to touch me
let me soak it in breathe you smellin lovely
kiss yo belly button and fill it with bubbly
take a taste let it drip down your waste
have it all over my face outer body experience like youre floating out of space
come back down gently
grind your hips on me you set with the melody
and let the words that i say live on in your memory

eye contact kiss me i kiss back
right there i miss that i cant resist that
and ill be climbing up over walls and ignoring all of my calls
stuff all the things pause cause youre giving me your all
but i never had a lover make me feel this real
hold it up in the room all night all day
all week im strung out like a freak
got me tapping on my arm for a fix
in between your sheets
work you out to this beat its just you and me in the suite
my tongue is all on your feet sheets covering me
im kissing all that i see exactly how it should be

the way i keep rein up servin and flippin this
dot the is cross the ts meticulous
the coldest winter ever and im so icicle ish
the movement is flavor full bags of licorice
the drop the rock the watch the necklace
theres no forgettin this the way im reppin this
my bodyguards big but do that make me rebellish
im in the hamptons game stronger than sampson
thats why im still a teen pop idol like hanson
young black and handsome movin with the cheddar
bring honey to the vip im about to get her lets go


i was stayin at the shore club leanin in the red room
seen this tan mami she was fresh off the sand dunes
big bottles and models and poom pooms
surroundin my table watchin me like cable
my dolce hat was low versace shades
had the prada shoes on cause the world is a stage
lah lah in the air its a sky bar affair
the glamorous life i had my glass in the air
when my eyes connected with somethin real real nice
like she finished her drink and started chewin on my ice
her smile was bananas teeth was pearly white
thats when i realized itll be a long night
the vibe was right she was laced in all white
her french manicure traced the crown on my mic
you ever try to focus resist with all your might
but every sip you take pulls you deeper in the hype

im talkin tan lines belly rings and things
dj rubbin my thing makin my head swing
all the honies was schemin
cause the rocks in my ears was gleamin
oh god i must be dreamin
my vision was blurry the party was rockin
the tools was knockin honey wanna get it poppin
try my best to chill she was fresh out of brazil
people was walkin by makin our drinks filled
what would you do if you was a don
in a position to wild out with a brazilian blonde
or maybe you a honey and its hard to keep calm
cause you sippin on somethin and homeboys the bomb
you dancin in your seat and singin along
and every sip makes you feel like you need to perform
the party is packed its just a little too warm
but you take another sip to prove that you strong

with every sip of my drink
i get a little bit closer
and when im tryin to re think
i cant really get focused
i wasnt tryin to be mean
i can see that its hopeless
cause your persistence overpowers me
i know you rollin out with me


i understand you want canaries on your hand
masterpiece rollie gold tri color band
cute wedding pictures sittin on the nightstand
you dont wanna make it happen unless its the right man
i know you wont touch me unless you trust me
you kiss me and hug me but still wont crush me
im kissin on your neck real tender
gentle as can be but you still wont surrender
let me kiss your eyes
let the smell of the incense enhance the vibe
i pull back to stare at your eyes
sittin there quiet like im hypnotized
we kiss a little more laugh and smile
might even share a lollipop you know my style
kick your charles davids off relax for a while
lets pretend that were walkin down the aisle
i cant explain it

straight up you beautiful b
i dont think you understand what you doin to me
on the couch witcha legs crossed watchin tv
shoe hangin off the tip of your foot you killin me
uhh then we kiss for real
im fully prepared im already steel
you go to the bathroom for a second
i understand baby i know what you checkin
thats when you come back and walk to me slow
thats when you change up and let it all flow
im kissin on your belly ring nice and slow
i love to take my time love to give you a show
get the warm chocolate syrup to travel below
use my ears like handlebars take control
aint no sense in stayin calm and playin the role
baby relax let me touch your soul

my turn to get rocked lifted out my socks
with sound effects and whatnot
a little perfume above the right spot just a touch
never too much i lick it like a dutch
two of my favorite numbers you know what i mean
add em up and they equal fifteen
you the six i needed you like a fix
i can see it my mind i knew we was gon click
i pick up the pace
you feel the stubble from my beard on your face
i look at your lips and take a taste
switch it up i got my hands on your waist

a year ago my slot was unassailable
my feast is a famine without you to cater to
if these walls could talk what would they say to you

the dining room has an empty chair
the mirrored staircase has an empty stair
house full of company but no ones here
were saying cheers while were holding back tears
to keep up appearances in front of our peers
we play holiday card tricks every year
black jack poker make the joker disappear
the ace cant breathe when theres tension in the air
three clubs in one night but nobody cares
cause its still not a full house without a pair
you tipped your hand but the text wasnt clear
youre dealing from the bottom queen of hearts play fair

slip in the door you hold my hopes so
all i hear is love dont live here anymore
we can tear the house down or build some scaffold
were sitting on a fence so where you wanna go
youre the architect of your life its your show
you create the blueprint and how the rooms flow
before you burn the house down think take it slow
even arsonists needs shelter let me know

fiftyfour point elevens poppin wheelies front of willyburgers
candy apple mthrees slidin out gently
rollin up in bentleys tyson was the champ then
right after the rooftop years before the hamptons
you was a ghetto queen and a diamond in the rough
you was so beautiful and the world was so rough
your man was locked up cause the cops popped up
you dropped out of school on top of that you knocked up
he was yo crush you was his crutch
hell be gone a dime and its hard to stay in touch
your moms say you stupid but you love him so much
now its broken dreams and broken beemers in the dust
standin up on a crowded bus for college courses
stay on course when it gets rough you never lost it
stay strong baby trust youll be back flossin
diamond studs and linen crush keep your head up

her boyfriends comin through with them hickeys on his neck
he claims hes lovin her but never shows her no respect
all she knows is neglect a lifetime of stress
big momma her momma now lil momma is next
you can see the effects of gettin treated incorrect
cause she let the cycle continue make excuses for his steps
her girlfriends tried to warn her all he wanted was the sex
once he get it then he gone then its on to somethin fresh
somethin new nuttin borrowed nuttin blue no wedding dress
but thats aight you still young you got your lifetime left
you gotta leave all that alone find yourself
theres no love until you love you remind yourself


just starin at these four walls closin
in on me feelin like times frozen
fadin in and out noddin and dozin
guilt tearin up my brain like erosion
what i did to you was wrong i admit it
i regret that i did it like a junkie when hes jonzin
all alone in what used to be a home
but you packed up our joy in that bag you put your clothes in
the voicemail that you left me was scoldin
hot enough to burn a hole in a cauldron
cause it was all true thats why we all through
now your girls pickin up the cell when i call you
talkin slick like she aint here
she dont want you no more punk disappear   click
i need to hit her with a brick
but thatll only lead me to a worse predicament
i hope your girlfriend aint got you on a liquor binge
with her bitter attitude just cause shes sick of men
but ima keep on callin fightin til the end
on my knees til they bleed to prove my love again

i seen you at the movies with some tall cat
so i bust his headlights with a ball bat
when i was with you he would give me dap and all that
now you in his arms in the mall what you call that
thats what i get for creepin and crawlin
every other weekend gone until the mornin
sneakin out to my dirt dead wrong
comin back past dawn with the guilty mask on
and i never counted the cost took heed to warnings
try to hurt a rose you get pricked by a thorn
and it dont feel nice when you wake up nights
shakin in cold sweats and your whole lifes a wreck
that was the old me the one i still regret
the one you couldnt respect the one you should forget


to show you i changed shawty
i really did change shawty
i wanna show you i changed shawty

i dont care if the cops got me surrounded
swat teams whatever tell em to send the hounds in
my minds in an altered state
like im headed for a wall top speed foot off the brake
i make a fool of myself girl whatever it takes
i already played the fool when i let you escape
youre as good as it gets your friendship your sex
everything about you and yours connects
from your beautiful smile to the scent of your skin
the sheets smell different this is not livin
it feels like dyin god knows im tryin
aint no sight sadder than a grown man cryin
please find it in your heart to forgive me
realize only god can convict me
we all make mistakes so have you
if god show mercy on me then you should too

oww

when you walkin in the presence of hust lers
uhh im laid back in the cinnamon range
two decades and aint a damn thing changed

lord have mercy sweet like hershey
kisses diamonds for the misses ices on the wrist es
all different colors of the spectrum
the smallest flaw and i reject em
believe me im a conniseur when i inspect em
i baguettes them invisibly sets them
they call me big l ly wonka from compton to yonkers
them chi town steppers and them a town stompers
these young rookies fail to understand
every summer i return like the ice cream man
drop what you doin get it get it while you can
by the eighth by the ounce when its gone ima bounce
its the f l a v no ifs or maybes
you know what i do drive your tastebuds crazy

my flavors unreal
smooth but hard like woodgrain on the wheel
recline your seat baby enjoy how it feel

raised by ogs that been in a correctional facility
the thing about this new generation they hella quick to bust they guns
without thinking about the repercussions they relatives and loved ones
i can look a fool in his pupils and just tell what he about
by analyzing his hand gestures and what come out his mouth

believe half of what you see and none of what you hear
analyze that fool before you let him get in your ear
sleep with one eye open and one eye closed
in case the thirsty and dusty try to kick in your door
never tell a homey how you make love to your woman
cause he might be the same homey who wanna fuck your woman
theres three sides to every story theres mines your and the truth
niggas loose they lives every day over a booch
you can fuck around and get stamped fucking around with a tramp
running around here loose without no structure in your camp

what niggas need to do is stay up off them phones
bragging about the nigga you popped and killed last night
cause then the dark gon come to light the streets talk
next thing you know you body all lined in chalk on the sidewalk
im laced

i read the d boy diary the hustlers encyclopedia
the players pamphlet the hood wikipedia
the instructions and manual on how to handle certain situations
when youre dealing with fake smiling faces
and they say theres traitors and haters

revelation one point eight i am alpha and omega the beginning and the ending saith the lord which is and which was and which is to come the almighty

this music my current mood
reminiscin and thinkin about my dude
he was a good dude
every time i ran into him ill say fool hecka cool

circumstances and penitentiary chances
been a block monster since the first day of school
nowadays seem like everybody pack a stick
nine times outta ten it be a brotha you grew up with

thatll pluck you in yo dome
do it with they team or do it all alone
i hope he went to space cause thats a much better place
i hope he said his grace make it into heavens gates

to this day it bothers me
backwards ball no life insurance policy
real spill two point zero one
pass the hat around for the funeral fund

i keep askin myself what is it gon take for me to get further in this world
what i gotta do cause i refuse to sell satan my soul
he a hater i keep my faith in the creator
got angels watchin me protect me from the undertaker

im tryin to make things right before i meet my maker
i worship the bible jesus christ my savior
show me where in the good book say i cant smoke a taylor
even when im drinkin i be perkin sayin my prayers

i spit it from the heart with my right hand on my chest
every time i take a breath i know im blessed
some of the people thats rich hecka depressed
some of the people thats poor dont ever stress

you only live once i think i heard em say
and you only die once my grandpa used to say
love and hug ya friends and next of kin
cause you never know when its gon be the end

two peter three point eleven seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness

two peter three point twelve looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of god wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat


two peter three point fourteen wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace


life is finicky
you never know when you creatin a memory
you never know when you creatin a enemy
you never know when you creatin a friend to me

tryin to get by
tell the devil that hes a lie
gotta bleed the blood of jesus
and repent before we die

love yo family
even though they can be wrong
cause you gon miss em
when ya family dead and gone

hug and kiss em
dont let em think that theyre alone
tell em you miss em
and they always welcome home

cause what you have can be gone in a blink
what really matters is not what you think
so be sure you show some appreciation

tough times no goals
dark hearts lost souls
snakes sharks black roles
fake smarks scarecrows

should i keep this job
or should i go back to push and hustlin
a little bit of somethin
is better than a whole lot of nothin

every time i take a step forward
i take a step back
and every time i take a step back
i take a step forward

never kick a person when they down
lift em up
you never know when you gon need a hand
or a buck

if he on drugs and you knew him
dont walk away from him walk to him
dont stay away from him talk to him
cheer for him dont boo him

tell him you here for him
fore you lose him
happy to hear from him
move him

be careful
but embrace him
give him some game
lace him

my mind is filled with rage
the ghetto is a cage
we got a lot of talent
but we aint got no stage


he aint playin with a full deck he been goin through a lot of shit

picked the wrong nigga to fuck with and the wrong day to do it
hell air this bitch out like a muthafucka pooted

and diarrhea at the mouth is forbidden
everybody know who did it but aint nobody fibbin
his cuznnem on the road they rap they ghetto gold
in a sprinter van fuck a bus on promotional tour

young niggas they savages they mamas is on dialysis
they daddy the streets the streets raised them lil bastards
so what you posed to do if you was them
if they die today theyll go to heaven

nobody taught em bout the lord and the afterlife
daddy in the bing mama on the pipe
life is a gamble so imma roll the dice
you only live once not twice

oh man cant trust ya own partners
niggas see ya comin up and try to rob ya
all day if you knew what i knew
youd be ridin round here strapped too lord

get a check from the work move around and bent
got a condo in the city you dont trust shit
not even ya bitch got a baby by her

how can a small town like vallejo have all these homicides
man fools be droppin like flies
maybe we need more brothers selling bean pies
and its a fool cause everybody mamas know each other
it aint cool but you know black folks like to act they color
wonder why all the good people get put through
so many different changes of the weather
and all those folks that do wrong seem like they live forever
i wish i can rewind time
remember when we used to get free lunch and the city bus used to cost a dime
runnin around talkin about you got the cooties
liftin up skirts and touchin girls booties
boy take those shoes off before ya come up in this house
and whatever you do dont you sit on grandmamas plastic covered couch
why is it that when all the homies get together we go back in the days
and how come every time we get drunk somebody bring up aids
life is something you cant borrow and give back
here today and gone tomorrow just like that
pat your ass on your back
take some time out yo waltz
tell your loved ones that you love them every so often

uh fetty is the key to the end of all your worries
contemporary crib cash cars and clothes
but fetty cause problems like guns and spears
families fall out and dont talk for years
like my cromey
they called him big bread ed
his first cousin set him up and left his ass for dead
churches wakes nothing unusual
seem like every other damn day im buying a brand new suit for a funeral
have your pockets ever lost weight and you aint even tried
did you wonder if your cash was on a diet
see when youre up everybody wanna come around
but when youre down aint nobody out there to be found
if you love someone you should tell em often
ya never know when theyll be layin in a coffin
dedicated to my weeples up in jail
ya partner forty water gotta story to tell

they can take the ninja out the ghetto
but not the ghetto out the ninja

ill get denied cause i dont know about the internet
what do you think we need to do to change about this nation
need to provide more jobs and better education
nuclear weapons  should be stopping crimes
already got enough to blow the world up a thousand times
the birds and the bees deadly disease
teenage pregnancies stds

a wuh uh wait a minute i hear sirens
oh thats the couple down the street domestic violence
either them or the little girl in three point six
shes always telling everyone that she gon slice her wrists
i guess thats the way it is in the life of sin
where youll probably end up dead or in the pen
but my family aint no better than the next
my auntie brenda turned her own sister in for writing bad checks
and saved folks will try to hit you where it hurts
knowing they the biggest hypocrites in the church
we need to give our minds a bath and do some scrubbin
stop the hate and start the lovin

id like to thank the mack god for all tha playa prophets that he sent
id like to thank him for donald goines and iceberg slim
for dottin their is and crossin their ts poppin their ps and
flexin their gs
id like to thank the mack god for all the playa prophets that he
sent before me and forty water
for the mack i chose forty water
to come into the world and change and rearrange
to lace the suckers and the anti playa
he came in the middle of the atlantic ocean on the glad sandwich bag
and floated ashore
and as soon as he hit the shore he balanced the game
he said that nine tenths of his law was possession
and that nine tenths of his game was position
and that everything was done on the approach
the mack god said that he would send an extraordinary one
on the side of forty water and he wont just be a playa
he will be an extraordinary playa
now we gonna turn the mack book from page two point one to chapter one point seven
and it talks about how they had a kangaroo court for the playas
and how dem suckas is out there with trumped up charged on e forty
well if you wanna judge the forty water bring him before twelve gs
and open his files
and you will see that he has been true with a capital t since he
was knee high to a grasshopper
that the mack god said that in the year one point fiftyfive that there was a
great explosion and some of the playas inhaled some fumes
pertaining additives preservatives and artificial flavors
the mack god refers to them as suckas
and he said that he would send one that would come from one
that was despised and rejected
and that he would send this extraordinary one in the world
and when he come he would come with ten commandments
and the commandments would be
thou shall not snitch
thou shall not infiltrate
thou shall not perpetrate
thou shall not playa hate
thou shall not hoe trust
thou shall not hoe save
thou shall not pay a trick
thou shall not disrespect the game
thou shall not be broke
and thou shall not be without that thang
the mack god said that just because you meet a hoe
and she wears a jersey that say champion and eat a bowl of wheaties
dont make her a winner
will she sell her hips her lips and her fingertips
will you tear down doors
and knock out cos
can you go the distance
will you be the one with the checkered flag in your hand
yeah cuz i will be the winner

he really a gangsta but they thought he was square as a box of apple jacks
he was getting his money from them but then he had a couple of setbacks
but hes still a celebrity with bounce back skills and ability
raised by ogs that been in a correctional facility
the thing about this new generation they hella quick to bust they guns
without thinking about the repercussions they relatives and loved ones
i can look a fool in his pupils and just tell what he about
by analyzing his hand gestures and what come out his mouth
that come from being from it experienced and seasoned
from hustling monday through friday clubbing and going to church on weekends

if you cant cook stay out the kitchen if you cant swim get out the ocean
dont hop in the yola game if youre soft as jergens lotion
believe half of what you see and none of what you hear
analyze that fool before you let him get in your ear
sleep with one eye open and one eye closed
in case the thirsty and dusty try to kick in your door
never tell a homey how you make love to your woman
cause he might be the same homey who wanna fuck your woman
theres three sides to every story theres mines your and the truth
niggas loose they lives every day over a booch
you can fuck around and get stamped fucking around with a tramp
running around here loose without no structure in your camp

what niggas need to do is stay up off them phones
bragging about the nigga you popped and killed last night
cause then the dark gon come to light the streets talk
next thing you know you body all lined in chalk on the sidewalk
im laced

i read the d boy diary the hustlers encyclopedia
the players pamphlet the hood wikipedia
the instructions and manual on how to handle certain situations
when youre dealing with fake smiling faces
and they say theres traitors and haters
you can look out for the homey with flying colors
but if you dont do it that one time you a bitch motherfucker
aint that fucked up what part of the game is this
brother throw me a bone imma appreciate it
i stick to the script im a laced individual
keep a clip on my hip and under my pillow
never leave your drink unattended when youre rounding up on a cutie
might be a setup broad might slip you a goofy

they was wrong when they said aint nothing new under the sun

opposite the tracks whatever its on yall
i came in the game with a hope and a wish
we gonna hop in the ride and let the rims roll
gotta hundred pair of nikes no timbos
and no i never had no afro
but i still keep everything natural
so many people wanna look alike
and act the same but whats the price
when you got no game they wont let you play
your too stingy you shouldnt act that way
cause your goin have to pay if you dont speak your mind
you been a follower a long time
stop lying and just be yourself
aint nothin wrong with that
you got racks you must be on some crack
cause the last time i checked you was struggling
had a whole lotta bad luck drug dealing
now get back on track like you need to
stop following the crew and be you nigga

the crack epidemic over head singdromas smoking crack outta tv antennas and blood donors
when it was organized game not organized lame
when niggas had some real reasons to put some change in ya brain
when we practically lived on ifive on our way to la la land
to recap hurry up during the dry season
this beat tremble  throbbing the trunk  am sitting in the car rollin a dealer blunt
right hand on my thumb incase they think im a cunt california didnt raise no punk

daddy and mommy went they separate ways when i was eight
but it made me great more stronger and god willing

uh lord plaza payless shoes got my shoes for cheap
when my parents separated i cried for weeks
had a passion for music beating on my desk
fourth grade elsa widenmann country club crest
signed up for the band mama wasnt mad
took me to minors music to buy a drum pad
and a pair of wooden sticks with the plastic tips
so i could practice my craft and one day get rich
kept it going started rapping in the seventh grade
heard rappers delight sugarhill gang
growing up life wasnt always fair
moved to magazine street nothing like bel air
a lot of shootouts and fights hustling to survive
i pray every day i thank god im still alive
a lot of my people aint here no more
they either dead or in jail on dog food or either blow

i went from chopped ramen noodles to garlic noodles at crustacean
a little snotty nose ghetto child see people grandma freebasing
done seen it all it aint too much could trip me out
only time when i cry is when the choir singing the missionary shout
some of my loved ones in the bing they locked up
they got a cell phone they mannish be on twitter and facebook
i send them the latest albums that slap
the music by mail access secure packhow about that
real ones be real ones my nigga
if you a real one my nigga lets get these millions my nigga
im with you if you off or on
love keeps no record of wrong
to all my people in the struggle going through it
listen to forty lyrics his music therapeutic
its sick out here
rifles big enough to kill a deer

blowing medicinal is traditional around these parts
only thing square about me is my candy chevy box
tremendous knock or should i say slap slumpin em
sound like the thing and the hulk in the trunk fading back there chunkin em
intersection shootouts bullets flying
im from an underserved community bad credit and crime
so many babies dying stuck in the middle caught in the chaos
everybody got guns anybody will knock you off
when it rains it pours lightning and thunder
im cool with the creator i got his cell phone number
i talk to him all the time
when the saints go marching in i want to be in that line
lack of communication leads to blood spilling
mama always taught me never tease and laugh at special needs children
she worked at napa state hospital mental institution maggies hamburgers and mr jimmys grocery store
three jobs

puffing skunk getting drunk off of triple x
ballantine i got more love than valentines

three young cats strapped with gats decided to ride out one night
the in flight drug used to induce the hindsight was dust
the moonlight was robust but they couldnt see the beauty in it
their duty in it was to carry out another senseless killin
senses and feelings distorted they boarded their vessel nessel
discreet in crotches and underneath seats they tuck heat
to complete the mission they had no decision in
no longer do they use our light and dark hues to create the vision in our towns
but now they red and blue override our brown skin
weve been conditioned to let off them rounds when we see another color rag
or hear another brother brag about what set he claimin
poverty drugs and poor education should be the target
but we wont stay gamin that
well kill and maim another cat like theres no shame in that
like theres fame in that
we hang out them car windows and bust them slugs
in the name of genocide in disguise so we dont take blame for that
but if theres honor amongst you thieves in life
then what the fuck you hidin for
recognize your deed to trife and decide what the fuck you ridin for

na na na na now now you know what this is
tell em its a celebration bitches
with the barbeque pits and the mini bikes
mini skirts hennessys and the miller lites
domino tables who got big six
where im from we do concrete backflips
flip flop flip flop flip flop back
to the ghettos where i bring hip hop back
real niggas love me they tell me keep it pushin
the only niggas speak from way inside central bookings
county jails and the lock downs up north
said i should have it if scarface pass the torch
thats how they feel jack built much more than rap
this that project haircut in the cul de sac
this is where jose front you them quarters at
meet your quota whenever i put a quote on a track nigga

from compton to baltimore ima kill it
i buy a morgue in the minute
the public house the plastic couch of a section eight tenant
the regal window is tinted
the air conditioner broke
but im cool enough to ensure you my ride is an eskimo
and i peel off
in the midst of gettin my thrills off
and i thrive off energies from inner cities that we lost
im puttin the ghetto on top of my back
and i live in the back of the jungle
lions tigers bears oh my
hear the siren walk up  drive by
shooters looters federal fed intruders
the engines on back of scooters
the real can recognize real
and we need to know just who you are
you are in the presence of many presents
kendrick the gift for the future oh yeah i said it
thug life good kid mad city
mad respect representin the hub right

the home girls tell me im the shit


motivated by money money is mesmerizing
many are murdered for it while mayhem is exercising
mighty as morpheus and might pay your mortgages
plus the morgue got some more of it
that embalming fluid merging through your muscles immortal is
philosophy rules if your mustard is mean
then your material views will put a misery on the broke
majority manifests a mission before they mope
for math we do the most observing the optimist opposites do attract
operation for evil its obvious for attack
obedience is a must but its hard to obey
when your optics aint saying no opportunities pay
it might be over a dice game might be over a new chain
might be over an old bitch or you owe someone old change
you open for open game then open your ears
its not an option its an order you get shit clear about money

the negatives are normal when you knee deep
when nice sins get stabbed with a knife in or shot with a nine
the neediest the nosiest they always trying to be friends
and if you naive you should notice all the signs
they known to turn naughty might gain notoriety
but your nemesis is lurking through the party
no exceptions no time to exit
your neighbours is near now you hearing noises
say you got a death wish everything is everything
well equity is evident find yourself establishing
etablishment executives street entrepreneurs
examined in they estimate
extracurricular drug activities the testament
taste the work excellent fiends excersing dope
to the head estrogen entertain i have a hope
intertwined with cut throats enter when you please
keep your eyes open its easy to be deceived about money

why the say money is the root of evil
because when you got too much of it
here comes the rude and evil
so tell me why money keeps you satisfied
do it keep food on your table do it keep you hell a fly
why why is money always on your mind
because the less fortunate dont have money all the time
why money got niggas out there doing time
cause snitches getting paid for police to drop dimes
why bitches set niggas up for the money
pussyll get you killed nigga dont think its funny
why niggas sell crack to they momma for the money
money will have you snitching while your family be hungry
and why envy a nigga who getting money
when you got the same opportunity to get it dummy yeah
its just a thought for your mental my nigga pay attention
get rich or die trying just know you cant take it with you
im talking money


still riding through the ghetto with the metal right on side of me
kill a california nigga palm trees and poverty
east side wild city got my block with me
bags of that kush big bottles sip a lot of henny
in the ghetto with my goons and my real bitches
nothing but a b thang show you where we bang
hurry on the grind getting benjamins
yeah we either selling a pill or meds for dividends
keep heaters for the evil trying to greet us
death around the corner you dont want to meet the reaper
all we know is blood money we aint never had a visa
trying to wade in that reefer only thing that could feed us
had the ghetto with my bloods since the days of a fetus
raised by the streets so its nothing you can teach us
bring the word like a preacher

when the homies show him love like everywhere he go
black rag up the back pocket different than the fo
west coast until im gone im here to let you niggas know

even if i have to push a couple rocks on the corner
i posted on the corner blowing that marijuana
with a loaded fortyfive for haters that really want it

not just because i dont really carry contraband and guns
living that thug life cause only homies show me love
what you expect from us all we know is the hood and drugs
it was the debt on us thats why they keep us in the slums
but i was built for more and cant let the ghetto cant stop me
why go to war when they shoot me here like paparazzi

where tinies pick you up and drop you off down the street
and say im too street and pay bitches on these beats
but they all ever seem to hear is rsc

vamos todo mi vida en el barrio no supe mas
long beach california the cinos de watts
mira como abrazo el bloke a yo
y ahora mira lo que toque yo
no más pistolas y rosas no
no más mi con fácil copas no
aprendí si no hay pratsa nadie avanza
el barrio nos hypnoto chansas y los planchas
amor a las calles que me criaron a mi
a ese que murió porque me brincaron a mi
fuiste lo mas real desde que te conocí
mucha sangre mucha lágrimas yo lo vi
el esfuerzo tatuado en mi cuerpo
el mejor secreto guardado por cierto
descanso con un ojo despierto
silencio soy el águila del siento

i used to christmas shop in the dollar store
and let a boy spend guap at the prada store
i gotta thank god for my rhyming though
beause everyone in the hood trying to blow
and i aint trying to say i got it honest though cause
i was right there at that corner store

there was a young ghetto child going wild after running round
who came from a happy home then got lost in the jungle
hit a lick for like ten chicks
brought it back to the bricks then got everybody rich
started his own clique recruited all piranhas
his favorite phrase thats on hunters
his niggas trained to go
wherever he point you got shitted on
or smoked like a joint
here comes the line up first fortyeight people remain silent
all his goons still remain violent
damn there goes another body oh shit sirens
another bite the dust like mickey thompson tires
lights flashing niggas stunt like the grammys
no ones exempt theyll sell a rock to your granny
now here is the part where jealousy comes out here to play
hood politics official when they want you out of the way
now back then we aint never mention this word
cause if you caught snitching consequences fo sho
niggasll throw you out on the freeway with a shell in your dome
and no feelings is shown
then look inside the eyes of these killers
a blank stare thats stiffer than stones
got you wondering where in life where they went wrong
dont wanna cross these types if you do think twice
its life saving dont get caught slipping when you ice skating

now when the sun rise this young man sees moneys a big deal
new chevelle  wipe in the morning dew cross his windshield
killers saturation while the smokers run through sanitation
for the bags of hands this young man calculating for the long run
since ya homies been on one lately
no ones safe he keeping his chrome off safety
headed to the function mommas gone they children out cussin
see this young man hit this bitch for all them niggas she fuckin

he dont want nothin now he walkin on crutches now
couldnt see him from the shoulders
he thinkin how can he buck him down

gotta be more smart now devise this option
watch how the plot thickens
the clock tickin his weak spot is a thot
just notice he cant stop trickin got him
now this how it starts
he take a bat when he know to go play with his heart
had his nose wide open while gettin head at the park
she set the gps location like this where we park
now you know whats next

got us wishin we was all born with a vest
i know you prolly witnessed it all
but picture the vision from the fly on the wall

keep niggas inspired you know im comin to share it with you
and when the wheels fall off ill get out and put on a spare with you
let me be real with you mhmm

sometimes niggas dont listen im hopin this serves its purpose
hopin they feel this shit despite how the devils is workin
to avoid tellin on myself i try to speak in third person

we was flies on the wall too from the shit we seen in our lifetime
and through these songs there were digressions
some stories we shared through music
question if we in our right mind
now im a new fuckin fly on the wall
i wanna see how many rappers really write rhymes

banging for fifty cent from a victim while my gun tucked
and somebody gotta get it
and when you make a dollar know somebody gotta spend it

i stay at your head or be at your throat
better ask your folk im never the dawg to provoke
niggas know the status and bitches come cast they votes
in my zone with coke and plenty of grass to smoke
im surpassin broke stay trapping for mo


the stench from the smokers smoke so ferocious
winos in the alley nearly slumped over
demons in they eyes glassy no folgers
wake up sober kill you for a cold one
snotty nosed rascals big ratchet toters
give it up slowly click clack its over
something like velcro stay attached to corners
hood rats plotting riding for the blue cheese
all for the gram grams and a new weave
all they got is spandex pants and some loose knees
niggas taking chances tip toeing with two ps
no ones exempt weak or strong they do bleed
candle light vigils closure if they do leave
bullets have a name defined by different calibers
concrete jungle beware of different challengers
gotta have the stomach for dookie bags and catheters
play your cards right or be scratching off them calendars

these waters are murky crocodiles they lurking
murder rate merging up and down virgins
guess you gotta play street versions of a surgeon
keep beat bursting closing down all your curtains
when shit dont go right gotta question your purpose
denim with them serpents coming back to surface
ebt zero balance worthless
you either leave in limousines or them hearses
too much bad blood another problem emerges
you started the problem you motherfucking deserved it
politicking a lot of liquor that be the answer
they marlboro trying to trick them they be the cancer
gotta get that loose change you gotta kick a nigga brain
like your name liu kang that be the mantra
stop look listen thats the words to live by
know you gotta stake your claim like a rib eye
nine point fiftynine nigga heres why

a force from the rap game my nigga this aint a circus
theres no ringling brothers no barnum and bailey
clowned ass niggas get marked out daily trucked out lately
bitch niggas get they hat brought to them you dont communicate
well hands and the gat talk to you whats the convo
dont think fast you end up getting a combo
think situations is calm then they bomb though
sleeping in the bando its either death or jail
something you never planned for dreaming about lambos
wake up shivering pillow next to a lamppost
straight up out the motherfuckin crockpot its watts
one stops leave you with dope socks is not boxed
no rats re rockthat got them all losing weight
got all they teeth shot but got a sweet spot
gotta call up dr dre just for the detox
all of this in one zip code keep the streets hot


i be that nigga they call jay rock im a rapper
but if you see me movin baggies out the trap dont get it backwards
a nigga out here tryin to stack that cabbage
cause if that moneys on the menu gotta hustle like you famished
you know i gotta eat to feed the family
okay let a nigga try us bus em like they transits
set your ass on fire know violence not the answer
but come try to play us you know we goin hammer
im twisting up fingers squeezin on heaters
hangin out the drop twopac out the speakers

they say get your money first and foremost
i rhyme like i got pollos in that volvo
shit i switch up whippers cant get caught thats a no no
so watch out the paparazzi takin photos
got this world around my neck keep my thoughts above my head
down to ride for my respect im a savage for that bread
shake ass baby you know im worth it nobody perfect
just look beneath your surface and ill bet youll find that purpose
yeah this hustle is poetry money dont grow on trees
big butts and ashtrays lookin smellin like potpourri
smokin this weed gimme what you got for a quarter ki

got to play a fool to catch a fool though
never let yo left know what your right doin thats numero uno
back to life im standin on my tomb door
why you actin puto she call me papi chulo
politickin at a all time high but im just gettin high
a lot of people like to wear disguises i just improvise
step up in this muthafucka lookin like a stick of dope
niggas steady shootin all they shots but they be brickin hoe
they missing hoe listen hoe got this shit on lock
like the figure fo sippin in that el camino sittin low
posted on the gram off a gram take a picture hoe
rubber bands im the man get just what you missin hoe


its like youre testing me now
this my testimony look i got that recipe now
keep that good book on the dash with that weaponry out
aint no mo rules in this game plus no referees out
all that stressing it taught me lessons
caught blessings went back to stressin
and that moment when death is present
had me praying and asking questions
i had no answers so i had to bottle up that aggression
load up them hollows and i had to follow in my direction
dont know where im headed
i cant look back though theres nothing there
but backstabbers snakes that slither decisions when nothings fair
keeping my faith in all even if they come take it all
stand on my ground i was born to fight so im taking off
me and my champs on a mission work with the baddest intention
sharp as a scalpel incision
gotta survive these conditions vengeance is like a tradition
if you practice what youre preaching might just get what you wish

now we have to get whatever we after
see past the regular shit that we master
learn to survive through love and jezebels and street pastors
live as free as we can cause hell on earth is being recaptured
im caught in this ghetto rapture spirit detached
im smoking backwoods looking for greener pastures
hashtag we bastards from money change to snowflakes
the body found a cold case we making it out from no place
now can you walk in these shoes with no lace
or push that sfive point fifty on shoes with no plates i dont think so
shit is insufficient when you think slow
thats why i keep one foot in the game like a flamingo
but heres the thing though picking my spots yelling bingo
post it with the work five point ones with the peacoat
this aint no new jack city and i aint nino
wondering if change gone come but we gone see though


the devil thought he had me i was on back burners
moonwalkin fast yall respect my journey
evil tappin in like the feds was watchin
no album no dope i was all out of options
id rather rob than get a job dont insult me
remember it was nicks and dimes in three
i was doing bad so i took your bag
tables turned lessons learned karma come back fast
flipped off that bitch milly rockin the wheel
two hundred thousand in the bank straight to hospital bills

dreams of enemies in the lobby when they hit the lights
so many niggas be wishin they was you bro
same niggas that hit you with that i love you bro
tread softly see the snakes comin i pop em off me
nigga my life costly

battle scars and tribulations downfall from the situations
i bounced off with dedication accounted for my participation

somewhere more positive like a plus sign
you know what time it is its time to get mines
i can see myself off and help
to the people in need like yourself
ill probably be a lot more involved in politics

moms in the room rollin up her weed
project parties every night no sleep
that was back then on the handlebars of a schwinn
high off beadies trippin off gin
just a little nigga needed more guidance
all i know is money all i know is violence
life is a plane and you just the pilot
watch it you crash and you burn if you wilin
i never talk much silent gangsters move in silence
you talk too much then you lyin
in the streets from the words that you speak
i seen it too many times talk is cheap

i am way more than what people might think when they look on the surface
what is my purpose yeah
that is a question that i have been asking myself and it hurts
cause its prolly something i should already know but i dont know it yet im tryna grow as a person woo
im sick of people tellin people im here cause of marketing dollars oh
you think that everything is gonna blow just cause you market it harder no
i got my hands in everything now they out here tryna get to me stop tryna lecture me

hung up on him i aint ready for it
ill get back to that when i make album four
less talkin ive been workin more
better me is what im workin towards
yall judgin but we not in court no we not in court oh lord
last couple years lets recap
i make a livin off of writin out my regrets
im doin me i dont care where the scenes at
try to give me feedback i dont really need that
i used to walk on stage in a v neck
i used to wear a lil tie with a black vest
i came a long way why you lookin upset
im tryna paint a picture get the vision you aint hear it yet woo
look hold up hold up wait a minute please
flows switchin i got add
brain scatters when you play the beat
it dont matter what you say to me
ill be doin this at eightythree
ive been doin this since abcs
in the major leagues doin major things dont play with me woo
im livin life in the fast lane
wake up every morning thinkin ima have a bad day
drive my own car i dont like the valet
park then i go into my mind with an ak
shoot every thought in my head then it rotates
losin it all but i think that im okay
who is involved i dont know but im insane
poof and im gone wanna call me a no name what
im prolly not what you thought
i used to judge everybody that wasnt like me til i learned it was wrong
girl told me i should get it together and get out the dark
im tryna give her my heart
thats when i sit in my car writin for hours until i can barely talk
i mean where do i start
feels like im fallin apart
act like my image is hard
i always put up my guard
even when talkin to god
sit in my room and i plot
everything that im not
comes out in the music i jot
i give it all that i got
i give it all that i got
im tryna think out the box no
yeah i got people standing outside a bus screaming my name
i dont come out and take pictures they tell me i changed
i dont smile in vips you get mad like you know what i paid
guess i dont know what to say
i leave it all on the stage


im back did anyone miss me
they said the second record can be tricky
well thats kind of funny cause i am not trippin
my fansthey know what it is and they with me
yeah i aint the type thats gon ride with the semi
i came from a town with three lights and no city
ive been doing shows for nothin but pennies
when i leave the stage they never forget me
mansion was a glimpse of my life
i let you see what its like to be in my head
people ask me what i think i think id be doin
if it wasnt music id rather be dead agh
you heard what i said that was like me at a three
you dont wanna see me at ten
or maybe you do
i promise if that is the case then that is what yall gonna get
if youre looking for music with watered down lyrics
i promise that you need to go somewhere else
and if you want somebody to tell you everything
that you wanna hear i wont be any help
this flow is familiar i think i heard it before
yeah i made it myself
i left the door open to come in my mansion
but i never said its a beautiful house
some of yall sat on the porch
looked at my windows and stared at my door
they ask me if im gonna kill it this record
i laugh in their face and i ask em do you see the blood on the floors
hes at it again
nf is crazy hes bad for the kids
he never talks about nothing but him
and my friends say hes kind of a diva
well you need to get some new friends
im as chill as it gets
til i get on the stage and flip on the switch
and i go to a place where nobody is
if you bring up my name in a song thats something that you will regret
learned a lot in a year
i remember the shows when no one was there
i remember the shows when nobody cared
some people in front of me laughing like he isnt going nowhere
its funny now isnt it
this type of life isnt how i envisioned it
this type of life it just aint how i pictured it
im in the back of the tour bus
tryin to facetime my family its different
not what you think it is
write a review tell me what you think of this
give me three stars and call me an idiot
but to be honest it dont make a difference
i know some people dont get it
but you have now entered a therapy session
if you dont like music thats personal
i have no clue what you people are doin here might as well throw out the record
i pull up a chair i talk to my music like nobodys there
only person i judge is the one in the mirror
and lately he aint doin well
i dont need yall in my ear
im tired of hearin it
you call it music i call her my therapist
she keep on telling me i have been carryin
way too much baggage i need to take care of it
i know shes right but man its embarrassing
music has raised me more than my parent did
take out a picture of us and i stare at it
who am i kiddin you probably aint hearin this
show me an artist you wanna compare me with
you put us both on a track ima bury em
give me the shovel its bout to get scarier
none of you want it with rap who you staring at
i see you got beats but where is the lyrics at
nf is the logo you know ive been wearin that
dont come to my show and be sittin that very back
i call you out in the crowd like there he is
thought id be happy it feels like im cursed
its hard to be clean when you play in the dirt
you gave me this place to go when im hurtin
i thought itd get better but its getting worse
and i got nobody to blame when i work
like twentyfour point seven i aint been to church
and satan keep callin me he tryna flirt
i hang up the phone these are more than just words
i drive on that highway and listen to mansion
i look up to god like when did this happen
yellin with all of my fans to wake up
but feel like i havent
i get emotional i didnt plan this
im doing things i never imagined
im sorry but i gotta leave
i dont wanna be late for my therapy session agh


when i first started never knew if they will listen
but when i write i produce passion thats mel gibson
if music is a disease i promise im infected
i dream on different levels of dreamsinception
and these beats are my playground let the words play
you aint catch it thats wordplay now youre stuck on the word play
im all business no suit on but thats okay
i will ko you if you come in my work space
and dont you ever try to tell me i lack passion
im a stand up guy i promise you aint laughing
these rappers are slowin the game downbad traffic
and how you gonna put me in a category of wack rappin
yeah listen im hulk i transform and i smash rappers
you sipping on syrup that doesnt mean youre a sick rapper
see what it means is you gon prolly get sick after
you dont like that im blunt or is it the fact that i smoke past ya

i put work in this music you think im makin this up
if the songs aint sharp trust me they aint makin the cut
you dont like it im no teacher but youll learn to adjust
im my own worst critic so critics step your hate game up
im a different breed of artist i know how to survive
you come into my lane you better know how to drive
and i suggest you buckle up if you gon come on this ride
no johnny cash but some of yall are walking the line
but you wrong though yall look curious
heath ledger type of questions like why so serious
and you want watered down lyrics well i dont carry em
i dig holes for these tracks and then i slaughter and bury em
the motivation i got is on a whole different level
i treat these lines like court case i dont wanna settle
and my lyrics are bullets and theyre aiming at you
and i aint talking switchfoot when i dare you to move

yo when it comes to punches you know im a land mine
no i said im a land mine
dont step on me or you get blown sky high
and i dont mean secrets when i say to keep it in mind
that im ill with the wordstoo sick
they say i rap hungry well thats cause im star vindiesel
thats why they calling me riddick ulous
cause the look in my eyes is different


wait wait wait
dont leave me
where you going
why you leaving
i cant lose you i cant lose you
girl i need you
and dont you love me dont you love me
guess you dont want me you dont want me
we back and forth yeah this aint working this aint working
love aint perfect love aint perfect

wait wait
what you thinking what you thinking
wheres your mind at
dont you miss us dont you miss us
cause you dont call back you dont call back
are you happy tell me are you happy
are you smiling are you smiling
girl what happened tell me girl what happened
cause i am dying i am dying

we dont wanna have a conversation
we dont wanna think about it we wanna just fake it
we just wanna act like everything is great
go back to the day watchin movies in the basement
and the problem is now im feeling like everything is changed
and im trying to make a livin on the music
but i feel like every time i look at you im in a place
its hard to be the man of the house when you aint gotta house
its complicated its complicated
we dont wanna talk
its complicated
im sitting in the hotel room like why
i call your phone and apologize
theres gotta be a way we can make this right
we can make this right


just wrap me in your arms in your arms
i dont wanna be nowhere else
take me from the dark from the dark
i aint gonna make it myself
put your arms around me
let your love surround me
i am lost

yeah yeah
yeah i feel like its just me like its just me
what it gon take what it gon be
i dont even know
but im lonely
feeling like i dont even know me i dont even know me
gotta have you gotta see you
youre the only thing i have to think about
the only one i that cant live without
i see you

if i aint got you
i aint got nothing
i aint got you
im lonely
if i aint with you im lonely
i need you

can you hold me


can you hold me in your arms

feel like its just me like its just me
i dont even know i dont even know
but im lonely lonely
feel like i dont even know me
feels like i dont even know me
i dont even know me


yo my mind is a house with walls covered in lyrics
theyre all over the place theres songs in the mirrors
written all over the floors all over the chairs
and you get the uncut version of life when i go downstairs
thats where i write when im in a bad place and need to release
and let out the version of nf you dont wanna see
i put holes in the walls with both of my fists till they bleed
you might get a glimpse of how i cope with all this anger in me
physically abused now thats the room that i dont wanna be in
that picture aint blurry at all i just dont wanna see it
and these walls aint blank i just think i dont wanna see em
but why not im in here so i might as well read em
i gotta thank you for this anger that i carry around
wish i could take a match and burn this whole room to the ground
matter of fact i think ima burn this room right now
somehow this memory for some reason just wont burn down
you used to put me in the corner so you could see the fear in my eyes
then took me downstairs and beat me till i screamed and i cried
congratulations youll always have a room in my mind
but ima keep the door shut and lock the lyrics inside

yo my mind is a house with walls covered in pain
see my problem is i dont fix things i just try to repaint
cover em up like it never happened say i wish i could change
are you confused come upstairs and ill show you what i mean
this rooms full of regrets it just keeps getting fuller it seems
the moment i walk into its the same moment that i wanna leave
i get sick to my stomach every time i look at these things
but its hard to look past when this is the room where i sleep
i look around one of the worst things i wrote on these walls
was the moment i realized that i was losing my mom
one of the first things i wrote was i wish i woulda called
but i should just stop now we aint got enough room in this song
and i regret the fact that i struggled trying to find who i am
and i lie to myself and say i do the best that i can
shrug it off like it aint nothing like its out of my hands
then get ticked off whenever i see it affecting my plans
and i regret watchin these trust issues eat me alive
and at the rate im goin theyll probably still be there when i die
the question is will i ever clean the walls off in time

so this part of my house no ones been in it for years
i built a safe room and i dont let no one in there
cause if i do theres a chance that they might disappear
and not come back and i admit i am emotionally scared
to let anyone inside so i just leave my doors locked
you might get other doors to open up but this doors not
cause i dont want you to have the opportunity to hurt me
and ill be the only person that i can blame when you desert me
im barricaded inside so stop watchin
im not coming to the door so stop knockin stop knockin
im trapped here god keeps saying im not locked in
i chose this i am lost in my own conscience
i know that shuttin the world out aint solvin the problem
but i didnt build this house because i thought it would solve em
i built it because i thought that it was safer in there
but its not im not the only thing thats livin in here
fear came to my house years ago i let him in
maybe thats the problem cause ive been dealing with this ever since
i thought that he would leave but its obvious he never did
he must have picked a room and got comfortable and settled in
now im in a position its either sit here and let em win
or put him back outside where he came from but i never can
cause in order to do that id have to open the doors
is that me or the fear talking i dont know anymore


all i ever wanted was somebody to hear me
and all i ever wanted was somebody to feel me
and everybody wanna tell me that im out of my head
when im on the mic thats fine but that dont scare me
its been a long time but im back now
rap pow welcome to the rap house
rap pow will live til i pass out
blackout blackout everybody keep on wonderin if i still rap now
are you serious
anybody out there hearin this
yo i came in the game as a lyricist
and ima leave like that period
you sniff lines i write lines
youve now entered in my mind
and you better get ready cause you might find
im from a different place and my kind
its a little bit different than yours is
quit snoring hip hop isnt dead
its just been in mournin
from the moment i quit recording
quick record this
listen im warming up and youre misinformed if
you think that im slipping up this aint sick enough
all i ever wanted was somebody to get this
all i ever wanted was somebody to play this
yeah take my song put it on their playlist
and get goosebumps every time they play it rate us
if thats my calling or not father maybe i should just not bother
go back to that nine to five but i am not a
quitter so quit that
i never been a killer but i guarantee i kill tracks
put them in a coffin lost in rip that
tryin to make an impact in rap is that insane
well i guess so
rap though better give me that pencil
and you aint ever gonna make it its all mental
i am in a place where i cant let go agh
i still work a job and do this and yall know whats stupid
i thought all you had to do was get a record deal and your things start moving
but thats not the case because most of the timesthe artists you hear
you keep on thinking that artist is new but that artist has prolly been at it for years
yeah in the back of my mind thinking am i wasting my time dreamin
and i aint got no money in my wallet but i guarantee there aint no way that i am gonna leave this
i need this i swear to yall i need this
and this hip hops in my veins if you cut me ima bleed it
and yo what you think i write raps for no reason no
take my pain and i put em in a songever since them pills they took my mom
what youre hearing now is me whether im in front or behind that curtain
i stand behind these words here im a christian but im not perfect
dont tell me to calm down im calm now listen im just working
yeah it might take a minute to get it but once you get it everything will be crystal clear
i dont think they see my vision here i dont think they see my vision here

dont tell me that this isnt real
this is all that i have this is all that i have


faith is something i am not accustomed to
and trusting other peoples something i dont really love to do
ive never been a fan of it i act tougher
really my shoulders they aint built for this and i dont have nothing
its like im standing in the rain and you offer me a raincoat
but i would rather stand there and get wet than take the handout
whats wrong with me you said youve always got your hands out
and i cannot continue on my own so take my hands now
i give you everything god not just a little bit
take it from me i am nothing but a hypocrite
i hate sin but i built a house and i still live in it
afraid to open up the door to you and let you into it
my soul is lost and what it needs is your direction
i know ive told you i do not need your protection
but i lied to you this thing is tiring
and man was not created for it god
please retire me now

trust is something i am not accustomed to
and i know the bible says i should always trust in you
but i dont never read that book enough
and when i have a question i dont take the time to look it up
or pick it up
it collects dust on my nightstand
im just being honest
please take this outta my hands
i have no control   i am just a person
but thank the lord that i serve a god thats perfect
i do not deserve the opportunity youve given me
i never knew what freedom was until i learned what prison means
i am not ashamed i dont care if they remember me
my life will always have a hole if you are not the centerpiece
take me out of bondage take all of my pride
if i dont have a savior i dont have nothing inside
take all of my lust take all of my lies
theres no better feeling than when i look in the sky in your eyes
its amazing

woaahh
woah woah woah
woaah

ill keep on


you make a lot of money and you live in a mansion
and pretty much got everything that you could ever imagine
but you feel like even though you got everything in the world
you got nothing
so what you do then is you start going backwards
you runnin in a direction
and you lookin for something that isnt real
and all you know is that you just gotta have it
what youre doin is sleepin
and thinking that youre awake and youre not
and the problem is that you dont know what youre after
so you put everything that you have into what you do
hoping that one day maybe you dont have to feel like youre empty
but as you get older a lot of weight on your shoulders is getting heavy
then you look back and you start to regret things
you only get one life
and every time you lookin at yours
you feel like everything you have is a waste
and the problem and the reason you could never fill a hole in your life
is because you were never awake

you wake up in the morning
but you feel like you never got up and go to work
and you feelin like you aint got a purpose
and you tryna get motivated but everything you do turns into a mess
like you aint nothing but worthless
and yo you look around
a lot of these other people you lookin at
to you you describe as perfect
so you point a finger at god and tell him to do his job
and fix ya life up cause nothin is workin
and you will try to hide it and make it seem like its nothin
but really you feel like everything is crashin around you
and you developed a problem in trusting in other people
which later became an issue that would mentally pound you
but every time you lookin at yours you feel like all you ever see are mistakes
and the problem and the reason you could never move forward in life
is because you were never awake
wake up


red bull in my hands feels like i got wings
lotta people in my face but i cant hear a thing
its like my heads up in the clouds heads up in the clouds
and i aint coming down no
just turn the music on just let me get lost
i swear that ima lose it if somebody turns it off
what are you out your mind
you must be out your mind

snap back on my head im so motivated
nikes on my feet understand the situation
this is not a game this is not a game
you aint gon bring me down no
yeah i mean what i say and i say what i mean
you best wipe off that hater look before you make me scream

i got the adrenaline
rhyme like im a veteran
fine ive been ahead of the
game no way im settlin
drained but ima get it in
lame this is a medicine
hey you get the medic kit cause
beats i dont let em live
fast better keep pedalin
blast you with the pen again
laugh but im ahead of them
act like i dont get it then
that is when i enter in
rap until i never can
cash it is irrelevant
passion is the element
laps around these other men
pass em who you runnin with
facts is what im coming with
back but i aint never left
snap but i will never get
wack you better get a grip
last isnt a medal its glass and ima shatter it
who do you think you battling
who do you think you laughing at
i am not a comedian man it dont even matter


dont know how to face it
lets go back to basics
yes say what you mean do what you say but man i hate this
i just dont know what im chasing dont know what im chasing
yes somebody told me
life is something you dont wanna play with
but i just keep on playing like life is just a playground
i go through these mood swings
watch everything slide down
i look at myself and i ask what the goal is
yeah tell me what your goal is
im just so lost in emotions i dont even notice
i just slip into a place and i dont think straight
devil in my ear tryna tell me everythings great
and in a year i realize im in the same place
running in the same race same pace

think about the words you bout to say before you say it
sin is bittersweet i taste it bittersweet i taste it
get that sickness out my mouth
i feel like my train is derailing
i can feel it
yo these words are only words until they actions
words until they actions strive on empty satisfactions
yeah the fact is i dont know  fact is i dont know
yeah i get on these stages say that i put on a show
but yeah that show it dont mean nothing
if i dont live my lyrics if they dont feel the spirit in my songs
then they dont hear it
homie yeah that dont mean nothing
this aint all about appearance
everything starts with the man in the mirror


when did i become so numb
when did i lose myself
all the words that leave my tongue
feel like they came from someone else

when did i become so cold
when did i become ashamed
wheres the person that i know
they must have left they must have left with all my faith

nf is a monster i am a villain
my music is sick and you dont know what ill is
you better get back i dont write any filler
i write what i feel and im feelin a million
so you better shh be quiet you hear it
im bout to lose it
im on a whole different level of music
dont treat me like i have no clue how to do this
you better rethink what youre thinkin and move it
now picture me writin when i was a kid
tryna make it in music i think it is crazy
i spent all my money on studio time
tryna get on my music so people could play it
ima keep it one hundred my music was terrible
learned to get better the more that i made it
go back to my moments album most of you people
you prolly dont know what im sayin hold up
what youre witnessin now dont try to figure me out
i grab on that microphone jawin the crowd
they was laughin at me who they laughin at now huh
i laugh at myself some people they lookin like wow
the moment you told me that you was a rapper
i couldnt believe it you believe it now
step in the booth and i murder it
you never heard of a rapper that kill it like i do
i sleep on the couch in the studio
stay up till three in the morning and write till i get more
the moment i wake up i feel like i dont even sleep
and im ready to put out my record
which thank you for buyin maybe you burned it
but either way im gonna wreck it
i look at the industry look what it did to me
youll never make it if you never grind
you put a whole lot of money into it
you better be ready to give it your time
i look at the past awful years of my life
and i promise you i have been givin it mine
try to keep up with this im not a puppet
no string on my back im one of a kind
music is changing no way to tame this
i am an artist look what i painted
hang up the caution tape im dangerous
does anyone know where my brain is
rappers are comfortable knowin theyre famous
but i really dont care what your name is
and i really dont care if im nameless
yall just drivin around i know where my lane is
cocky nah im competitive
this is a job for me its adrenaline
dont try to box me in i am mayweather
i come in the ring my punches are way better
i never drink but i live in these bars
the moment you blink is the moment you lost
say you a king who put you in charge


im dedicated the definition of dedication
wrote this whole record while i was levitating
sittin in my room with the pen and paper im innovative
theyve been afraid of me since i was a second grader
im the kid on the playground mama told you to never play with
theres levels of musicand im in the elevator
going up to the top floor look how we elevated
what you dont know the brand by now you better get educated
take both of my arms rip em out the sockets and separate em
forgive me yeah i know i get animated
dont matter i still write a better record than yours without a hesitation
never been more motivated
just look at all the minds i have opened and penetrated
see i am the voice of all these kids that think things but never say em
thats why they come to my shows wearing the nf hoodies and hats low like were carrying weapons ah
put the controllers away its game over
i promise im way colder
the fans keep saying that theyre hungry for new music
well thats pretty convenient cause i just made a plate for em
and i dont hear what none of yall are saying
i just sit at the keys feeling the music
got me thinking im beethoven
the game needs a makeover
if youve been waiting the waits over
you aint notice yall about to witness a takeover im home
yeah they waiting on me to match the
emotion that i had in the last one
what if i dont they gon tell me that im losing my passion
if i do am i repeating my actions
yeah look how could you leave us is massive
there aint nothing i can write thatll match that
my biggest fear writing this record wasnt putting out trash
it was disappointing myself and the fanbase
now i want you to picture me
im in a hotel rapping crying on the floor of the bathroom
staring in the mirror my room hands shaking playing how could you leave us through the speakers on my iphone
tryna figure out if ima always feel the way that i feel or maybe someday i can learn to be happy
or maybe i cant be cause if the music aint emotional enough are they gon call me a has been
pains always been the root of my music
if i cut it off how am i supposed to keep growing
if i let it go wont my whole career be in ruins
thats when i realized this whole conversation is stupid
i never cared to impress people that dont even know me
i just write what i feel somehow it started a movement
trying to enjoy a career but i dont know how to do it
when i spend all of my time being afraid ima lose it
but then i figured out the reason they follow me
the reason why these fans surrounding me
its not cause im a rap god
i dont need you people to bow to me
all they ever did was doubt on me now everyones proud of me
acknowledge me or not you aint ignoring the following
im just teaching em something they couldnt learn in they colleges
this is for the kids feeling like they live at the bottom and every day of they lives feels like its darker than halloween
yeah you aint alone out there look around youwe got a lot of fans in here
couple hundred thousand thats what we did last year


yeah i guess im a disappointment doin everything i can
i dont wanna make you disappointed its annoying
i just wanna make you feel like everything i ever do
was never tryna make an issue for you but i guess the more you
thought about everything you were never even wrong
in the first place right yeah ima just ignore you
walking towards you with my head down
lookin at the ground im embarrassed for you
paranoia what did i do wrong this time
thats parents for you
very loyal shoulda had my back
but you put a knife in itmy hands are full
what else should i carry for you
i cared for you but

yeah you dont wanna make this work
you just wanna make this worse
want me to listen to you but you dont ever hear my words
you dont wanna know my hurt yeah
let me guess you want an apology probably
how can we keep going at a rate like this
we cant so i guess ima have to leave
please dont come after me
i just wanna be alone right now i dont really wanna think at all
go ahead just drink it off
both know youre gonna call tomorrow like nothings wrong
aint that what you always do
i feel like every time i talk to you youre in an awful mood
what else can i offer you
theres nothing left right now i gave it all to you

yeah dont talk down to me
thats not gonna work now
packed all my clothes and i moved out
i dont even wanna go to your house
every time i sit on that couch
i feel like you lecture me eventually i bet that we
coulda made this work
and prolly woulda figured things out
but i guess im a letdown
but its cool i checked out
oh you wanna be friends now
okay lets put my fake face on and pretend now
sit around and talk about the good times that didnt even happen
i mean why are you laughing
must have missed that joke let me see if i can find a reaction
no but at least youre happy


yeah
my name buzzin aint no way you could ignore it
i did not come this far so they could ignore me
i am not the one to say ill do it in the mornin
id rather get it done dont focus on whats not important
they try to talk to me like they been nothin but supportive
appreciate the love but do not show up on my doorstep
if you aint about that real i suggest that you avoid me
if we aint on the same page thats the end of story agh
you are not a baller cause your closets full of jordans
you are not a rich man cause youre on the forbes list
first i drop the record then you know i gotta tour it
reals still the slogan only difference is theres more of us
the story of my life feels like its just beginnin now
i ask you a question i want answers not the run around
you the one that brought it up but im the one to shut it down
if you aint got the album yet i brought you one im at your house
hey

i know where im goin i dont let no one distract me
i dont need directions from nobody in the back seat
i dont need these people in my corner tryna gas me
id rather have people in my corner tryna check me
yeah i walk off the bus a different city than the last week
let the fans speak they gon tell you bout the past me
if im bein honest last year i was in a bad place
wouldnt say im out of it but dont feel like i cant be agh
who you know droppin clean records but they nasty
i was made for this i could tell when mama had me
i hopped right off the table told my doctor i aint average
he asked me what does that mean
i told him get the pen and pad please
whod a known id write something that could change lives
i dont think yall fully understand the way you changed mine
i look at the future thats in front of me with both eyes
three records three years i dont like to waste time
oh yeah


been sick with the pen since i was ten inches tall
im relentless you guessed it back with the vengeance
in the set list every sentence so raw you can sense it
no question tryna be the best that
ever walked this earth if im not then im next up
dressed up like im bout to hit a bank or somethin
yeah i am not the one you wanna mess with no
when i come into the room put your heads down
im a little bit tøp stressed out
what does that mean
im a rap fiend with a bad lead
you could run if you want but youll never catch me
so cold with it yall dont get it
let you put me in a cage just so i can open it
handcuffed hands up this is dope to me
oh you thought you had me captured so funny
better run from me i dont think you really understand what this does for me
i dress bummy but i clean up nice they aint never seen this side of me
long t shirt they eyein me
rules dont apply to me
you better give me my privacy
i got the fans i got because im takin them behind the scenes
you played hide and seek i played hide from me agh
yeah look at all that we accomplished
quittin for mes not an option
i wanna look at my kids in the face when im older and say i did something admirable
fast checks fast women that dont inspire me no
you dont wanna know whats goin on inside my personal life then get out my diary yeah

yeah record labels signin artists they aint got a clue what to do with
why would i put my career in the hands of someone that dont even know what they doin
why would i sit in a room full of people that dont even care about me or my future and tell me they aint really feelin the vision then hop on the wagon the moment its movin huh
heard you tellin people you dont really like the content
whatchu wanna hear me rap about
how im on the road gettin side chicks
you should treat your mouth like your phone in a movie theater put that on silence
i dont care what everybody else is doin im just bein me and thats not how i live
oh my oh my yeah im in the zone now
zoned out come to my show with they phones out
whole crowd oh wow thats wild tone down no
i have created my own style
i have created my own sound
oh you didnt know well you know it now
slowin down
livin happy this is what i was made for
they say you get what you paid for
grandpa told me always look to heaven try to pay attention when you talkin to god yeah
i wish ida paid more i shoulda prayed more
everybodys out here shoppin tryna find a different product in the same stores
everybody wants they dream to fall in they lap but dont wanna work for it
ive been doin this since i was just a kid and mama bought me eight mile at the movie store
hopin someday maybe i could do what i love for a livin with people i care for
people that care more about me as person than money i make for em yeah


yeah i know the person in the mirrors not a perfect one
i look at him every day and think hes not enough
my lifes a book that i dont really like to open up
im twenty six but i feel like i live in chapter one
i skim through it ive been through it they laugh at us
you think its funny yeah laugh it up
i always felt like no one listened to me thats how i grew up
church is where i found god but its also where i learned to judge
yeah i had to learn theres a difference between
what you want and what you really need
ive always been motivated by comments from people tellin me things they think ill never be
and then i become it this is my everything
theres so much that goes on in my head that people will never see
you probably be terrified of my memories dont lecture me
let me be let me see let me breathe how they remember me
doesnt alter who i am as a person to take my energy yeah

yeah my fans made me who i am but they also deceived me
ive been allowed to live life like im already grieving
im at a table of liars but dont eat what they feed me
my hoodie over my face so nobody can see me
im on a plane bout to fly again
looking out the window take a moment to admire it
wondering how high it is wonder where the time has went
then i shut the window and go back to feeling like im out my mind again agh
yeah seems like were all trying to climb a ladder
its crazy what well do to climb it faster
its like we throw away the things in life that really matter
just so we can make it to the top and wonder what were even climbing after
i know the feeling of feeling like everything that you deal with
dont never change thats part of being a human yeah
lifes what you make of it take it embrace it and take it and savor it
aint about what you did its what you became from it agh


listen why they always tryna hurt me
why they always tryna burn me
i swear to god shoulda never even happened in the first place
only time you hit mes on my birthday
wish that i could tell you that i got a lot of love for you
wish that i could tell you i got trust for you
once you put some money in the bank you understand that the money aint enough for you
yeah look what its done to you
everyones your friend when the music start buzzin
im closer to the people that were there when i was nothin
tryna talk about the past but you always changin subject
i aint good at shakin hands but im good at holdin grudges
why you always frontin huh always tryna play wit me
yeah whatchu gotta say to me
i am not a slave to the people writin checks to me
this is destiny they aint never had respect for me ah

yeah you said im scared for you
lemme say a prayer for you
hope you never make it to the top just to find out there aint nothing there for you
and now the people tryna tell you that they care for you never cared for you
first time that you ever told me that you loved me i know that was probably weird for you
cause i didnt say it back im so caught up in the past and i know i wasnt fair to you woo
maybe i dont see the world like im sposed to
maybe im just living in a nightmare
maybe all the people that i thought that i was close to
wouldnt be around if it wasnt for my career
yeah this third record doesnt pop off how many people bout to drop off
i know how it works if the record doesnt work then its my fault
im in a room full of fans singin my thoughts my god woo


what are you scared of me thats embarassin
if it wasnt for me you wouldve never wrote therapy
ive been here for you but how come youre never there for me
its a little bit twisted but i miss when you and i had scary dreams
i dont really wanna talk about it
well thats too bad now nate
shut up
now where were we
well back in the day when
you and i had it all mapped out in the basement
cryin in your room like a baby
i wish mom was here
we all do so we wouldnt have to hear about it every single record
you dont really wanna change me
yeah im the one that made this happen
do you really wanna get rid of your main attraction
lets pack our bags and go back to gladwin now
yeah its time for the third record
and you know i got the content
i dont wanna make you nervous
but it aint like it used to be we got a lotta people watchin
you told me that you dont want me in your life thats pretty hard to digest
and i told you id leave when we die and we aint died yet
therapy session was beautiful nate but im wonderin whats comin next
yeah get that stupid hat off of your head when im talkin to you you hear what i said
you dont like the prison i built you
yeah you wanna know what the funny thing is
you keep on talkin to me like a stranger but weve been together since you were a kid  yeah
took us from a no name told you everything was okay
now you tryna cut me out of it like i aint never been a part of it i am the heart of it i made this whole thing
yeah i put us on the dope stage you must have no brain
whats the point of having guns if you cant aim
whats the point of havin blood with no veins
whats the point of havin love with no pain
what im sayin is me without you doesnt make any sense
i know im intense in controlling but you need to learn how to cope with it thats just the way that it is
if you didnt want me to live in your house you shouldnt have let me move in
its comfortable here and i like it i got my own room and everything it dont get better than this
you say you wanna own your life then wake up and take your own advice
you just mad cause you know im right
yeah im flattered you put me in mansion but you shouldve told em right
hold your hands on the coldest nights
you didnt tell em bout the times you and i used to hold the mic
i mean what are you outta your mind
cause both of us will be come on lets go outside
is this what you wanted
both of us out in the open lets do it then
i mean why are you doin this
i know that youre mad but im not in the mood for this
we got a record to drop
so why you actin like im not a part of it
aye where is my shovel at
prolly out backwhere it always is
you cant get rid of all of me
im the reason why
nah shut up i dont wanna hear another sentence
hey im nf
is it me or the fear talkin ha what a dumb question
yeah its real music til the day we die right
yeah aint that the slogan nathan
thought i told you to keep your mouth shut
i mean so what you know i never listen
let me guess we gon dig a hole kill the track and prolly put a beat in it
rap about it for like three minutes
ayy thats pretty deep isnt it
wait a minute you dont really think for a second that youre puttin me in this
no of course not just a little deeper then well go inside and we can stop diggin
you had me scared for a second i thought we were diggin my grave
we did what you dont like bein afraid
heres a dose of your own medicine
what you dont like how it tastes
my therapist told me dont bury my issues but ima be honest man im feelin great
i think its only right we go back to where you were created
i wrote a song for johnny without you but he aint gon like it lets see how he takes it
he probably dont even remember us does he
i wish i was buryin anger
but both of us know ima need him for that song he still lives in the basement
almost done shoulda done this a year ago i dont know why i waited
you know how i get i put everything off in my personal life you hear what im sayin
that was a joke yeah its hilarious aint it
youll spend the rest of your life in my backyard or back of my mind depends how you see it
put the shovel away time to go back in the house now youll be out in a week
tellin me you want your room back thats funny what you aint got nowhere to sleep
ima just look out the window and laugh at you this is crazy to me
cause i thought you had me in prison this whole time but im the one holdin the keys


i meant it when i told you i would change
meant it when i told you i would stay
sick of talkin on the phone babe
time to pack your car and come to my state
come to my place look at my face oh yeah
you know i aint playin
im savin some money yeah hop in the car
and get on the road here we go
baby i cant lie
im a little bit im a little bit scared right now girl girl yeah

yeah i knew it you was my type
we aint gotta skip to the highlight
youre the highlight girl of my life
both of us have got a past but its alright
all night car rides
drivin through the city yeah the views fantastic
its automatic could see you smile gotta have it
she got me thinkin maybe ima have to put a ring on it girl
i aint never been a romantic but i can romance ya
get your shoes on baby i am not asking
im bout to take you out to dinner put the black dress on
got the room gaspin how did this happen
i dont even know
shes the type to sing my words at the show
shes the type to pick me up when im low
and remind me she got my back no matter what
yeah i think she hearin me now
say what i think so im thinkin out loud
i need a woman i know i can trust and i got one
i guess you can say that she down
callin my phone and she told me she proud
she said my name and i like how that sounds oh yeah


i mean this with love when i say it
i wanna answer the phone when you call me
the problem is its ten am and youre already drinkin
youre probably already wasted
whats the point in having conversation with somebody that
wont remember we had conversations yeah we always talk about the same things we just say em different
try to fix it crazy isnt it
you say mom was always proud and played the videos of us as kids i get it
i think that both of us live in the past so we take for granted the present
maybe next time im in michigan ill come and visit
we aint got a lot in common but both of us miss her
we could sit inside your smoke filled livin room and tear up together thats real

you know my patience is very thin
wish i was there again
im not embarrassed to say that weve always had issues
im embarrassed to say that we never took care of em yeah
pain will always find its way to the surface
no matter how deep you bury him
growin up i felt like no one ever really got me eventually
i took that out on relationships
i put my arm around you and i mean it i love you to death
these are the moments i know ima always hold onto and cherish em yeah
lifes about taking chances making moves
not about what you did its what you do
build on what you got and learn from what you lose
and never let people distract you from being you


yeah most of my lifes full of sad days
started at a young age
yeah bought a house but ive been livin on stage
tryna find the real me i aint found it yet
wake up every morning feelin like im guilty
talk to god can you hear me
lately im a mess
i dont want no one to help me
yeah i dont want no one to help me and

most of my lifes full of regrets
things i wanna take back yeah
wrote you a letter wish that i had never sent that
didnt even make sense i dont even know
all i know is i get lower on the weekends
they tell me i should make friends i just sit at home
lately ive been off the deep end yeah
ive been off the deep end and

yeah im reminiscin back to both of us laughin
playin old records thinkin every one of ems classic
windows down we on the street up in michigan rappin
we talked about it but never really knew it could happen
my confidence about as low as the gas is
we didnt have the money for it so wed turn the key backwards and sit in parking lots for hours till the battery crashes
i think that we related cause both of us were lookin for answers
a couple months ago i drove into gladwin got me all in my feelings
its somethin bout bein somewhere thats familiar
pull in the gas station open up the tank then i fill it then laugh
would i move back mm not in a million but i appreciate the memories we had
i know youve been callin sorry i never call back
i know ive been distant you know i never meant that
you can tell the family how im doing if they ask
im just doin me


yeah i heard you said i aint the type for you
i dont regret it though i learned from it
they should have you locked up for all the time you stole from us
took you out when i had no money
only person that you ever cared about was you thats why its so funny
you want somebody thatll keep you warm at night then tell me why you actin cold to me
you aint the only one to blame no im the one that made you rich when i bought every lie you sold to me
yeah heard you threw away the pictures
but you still got the memories of us so i guess i dont really make a difference
flippin through em in your head
got you texting me all hours of the night
yeah you told me that you needed distance
whats the deal with you
you say you want a man that keeps it real
then why you mad when i get real with you
you want someone to pay the bills for you
went from feelin you now i feel for you liar

look let me guess you want to stay friends
tellin people thats how we been
tellin everybody yeah that we was barely speakin
ah thats kinda funny whyd you call me every day then
its immaturity you goin off the deep end
you just want somebody you can chill and get some drinks with cool
then dont hit me on the weekend tellin me you missed the way we talked and how i listen yeah
why you playin with my mind huh
why you playin with my time huh
told me we should let it go and put it all behind us
thats what i did now you askin me what i done i was
waitin for this day i saw it comin
i think you just like attention tryna tell me all your problems
i got issues of my own i aint got time for all this drama
you told me that you dont really wanna talkthen why you callin huh


yeah handouts create lazy people im not impressed with
you want something in life then why dont you go and get it
actions speak louder than words do its pretty quiet isnt it
look at the world we live in defined by comment sections
surround yourself with people that challenge how you think
not people that nod their head and act like they agree
those people will cut you open just to watch you bleed
always be yourself not the person that you pretend to be no
these people gon tell you that you will never make it
then when you do they gon say they knew you were goin places
thats just how it works next thing you know youll be overrated
hearing people say they miss the old you its crazy aint it
and perfect people dont exist so dont pretend to be one
i dont need pats on the back from people for my achievements
when i die i wanna know that i lived for a reason
anyone can take your life but not what you believe in no

yeah dont take opinions from people that wont listen to yours
if moneys where you find happiness youll always be poor
if you dont like the job you have then what do you do it for
the cure to pain isnt something you buy at liquor stores nah
the real you is not defined by the size of your office
the real you is who you are when aint nobody watchin
you spend your whole life worried about whats in your wallet
for what that money wont show up in your coffin woo
yeah angers a liar he aint got no respect
i fell in love with my pain and i slept with my regrets
happiness saw it happen maybe thats why she up and left
joy called me a cheater said she aint coming back
ive always had a problem with relationships
but thats what happens when you see the world through a broken lens
mistakes can make you grow that doesnt mean youre friends
who you are is up to you dont leave it up to them no

yeah they say you got into music you signed up to be hated
thats kinda weird cause i dont remember signing my name up
coming from people that give advice but never take none
i like my privacy but lately i feel its invaded
i heard that lifes too short dont let it pass you by
we waste a lot of time crying over wasted time
its not about what people think its how you feel inside
my biggest failures in life are knowing i never tried woo
i look at the world from a different angle
people change even satan used to be an angel
think twice before youre bitin on the hand that made you
dont believe what you believe just cause thats how they raised you
think your own thoughts dont let them do it for you
say you want a drink dont wait for people to pour it on you
cut out the liars stay close to the people you know are loyal
grab your own glass and fill it dont let your fear destroy you woo


i just need some time im tryna think straight
i just need a moment in my own space
ask me how im doin i say okay yeah
but aint that what we all say
sometimes i think back to the old days
in the pointless conversations with the old me
yeah back when my momma used to hold me
i wish somebody woulda told me

yeah as a kid i used to think life
is moving so slow i watch it go by
look out the window on my bus ride
i thought the world was so small through my closed eyes
ive always tried to control things
in the end thats what controls me
maybe thats why im controllin

the older i get i feel like im always tryna save time
talkin to the voices in my head they make me think twice
tellin me it doesnt mean its wrong because it feels right
im scared that one day ill wake up and wonder whered the time go
talk about the past like its the present while i rock slow
ill sit in the living room and laugh with kids of my own
and tell em


im dedicated the definition of dedication
wrote this whole record while i was levitating
sittin in my room with the pen and paper im innovative
theyve been afraid of me since i was a second grader
im the kid on the playground mama told you to never play with
theres levels of musicand im in the elevator
going up to the top floor look how we elevated
what you dont know the brand by now you better get educated
take both of my arms rip em out the sockets and separate em
forgive me yeah i know i get animated
dont matter i still write a better record than yours without a hesitation
never been more motivated
just look at all the minds i have opened and penetrated
see i am the voice of all these kids that think things but never say em
thats why they come to my shows wearing the nf hoodies and hats low like were carrying weapons ah
put the controllers away its game over
i promise im way colder
the fans keep saying that theyre hungry for new music
well thats pretty convenient cause i just made a plate for em
and i dont hear what none of yall are saying
i just sit at the keys feeling the music
got me thinking im beethoven
the game needs a makeover
if youve been waiting the waits over
you aint notice yall about to witness a takeover im home
yeah they waiting on me to match the
emotion that i had in the last one
what if i dont they gon tell me that im losing my passion
if i do am i repeating my actions
yeah look how could you leave us is massive
there aint nothing i can write thatll match that
my biggest fear writing this record wasnt putting out trash
it was disappointing myself and the fanbase
now i want you to picture me
im in a hotel rapping crying on the floor of the bathroom
staring in the mirror my room hands shaking playing how could you leave us through the speakers on my iphone
tryna figure out if ima always feel the way that i feel or maybe someday i can learn to be happy
or maybe i cant be cause if the music aint emotional enough are they gon call me a has been
pains always been the root of my music
if i cut it off how am i supposed to keep growing
if i let it go wont my whole career be in ruins
thats when i realized this whole conversation is stupid
i never cared to impress people that dont even know me
i just write what i feel somehow it started a movement
trying to enjoy a career but i dont know how to do it
when i spend all of my time being afraid ima lose it
but then i figured out the reason they follow me
the reason why these fans surrounding me
its not cause im a rap god
i dont need you people to bow to me
all they ever did was doubt on me now everyones proud of me
acknowledge me or not you aint ignoring the following
im just teaching em something they couldnt learn in they colleges
this is for the kids feeling like they live at the bottom and every day of they lives feels like its darker than halloween
yeah you aint alone out there look around youwe got a lot of fans in here
couple hundred thousand thats what we did last year


they say the flow is soundin like a mixtape
yeah you shoulda left this on a high note

that you wanna hear i wont be any help
this flow is familiar i think i heard it before
yeah i made it myself
i left the door open to come in my mansion

they ask me if im gonna kill it this record
i laugh in their face and i ask em do you see the blood on the floors

nf is crazy hes bad for the kids
he never talks about nothing but him
and my friends say hes kind of a diva
well you need to get some new friends
im as chill as it gets
til i get on the stage and flip on the switch
and i go to a place where nobody is
if you bring up my name in a song thats something that you will regret
learned a lot in a year
i remember the shows when no one was there
i remember the shows when nobody cared
some people in front of me laughing like he isnt going nowhere
its funny now isnt it
this type of life isnt how i envisioned it
this type of life it just aint how i pictured it
im in the back of the tour bus
tryin to facetime my family its different
not what you think it is
write a review tell me what you think of this
give me three stars and call me an idiot
but to be honest it dont make a difference
i know some people dont get it
but you have now entered a therapy session
if you dont like music thats personal
i have no clue what you people are doin here might as well throw out the record
i pull up a chair i talk to my music like nobodys there

and lately he aint doin well
i dont need yall in my ear
im tired of hearin it

my life is a mess better watch your step when you step in it some of this brain is off limits
im off in a world you dont get cause you aint ever been in it
in ten minutes i still couldnt explain whats inside my brain dont mess with it
ive invested a lot of me inside these lines im just protectin em
everybody wanna hear the real version of life then dont get so sensitive
when i say something a little bit raw i jot my thoughts and they call it negative
you wanna know where my heart is i stand out cause i wear my garbage
i work my hardest and every time i look into the mirror i dont forget about where i started woo


i heard that pictures dont change
just the people inside of em do
whoever told you that life would be easy
i promise that person was lyin to you
you got a problem with followin through
thats why i got a problem with followin you
you keep lookin at me like this problem is new
but weve been here before what you tryin to do
dont talk to me like i dont know what youre feeling
cause i was there with you back in the beginning
quit looking away when i talk let me finish
im tryna be honest youre tryna forget me ugh
whats wrong with you hey
i know that you got a lot on your plate
you keep telling me i should get out of your way
but i cant see how you gon lie to my face
dont tell me youre fine
cause i know youre not so dont even try it
and what we gon live for in this life full of pain
til were eighty and one day well get up and say we regretted our lives
cause thats where were going
and do not pretend like you dont even notice
the funny thing is that you already know it
im starting to think that you like how it feels to be lost in the moment

yeah they told us that time flies didnt know what it means
now i feel like were just running around tryna
catch it and hoping to cut off its wings
but that aint gon happen
joy when was the last time we had it
i dont remember cause all that we do
is go backwards but thats what you get
when you live in the past
and i know were breathing but were not alive
really is this the way we wanna die
til you got everything bottled inside
if they only knew what goes on in our minds
i know what youre thinking so dont try to hide
why do you look at me like you surprised
if you really mean what you write in these lines
then why dont you fix it cause im getting tired
yeah i can no longer do this
ever since you fell in love with the music
see you find a way to express what you feel
but the moment that you get away from the mic you dont know what youre doing
is it clear to you yet
i dont know whats going on in your head
but eventually youll have to deal with the things
that you talk about yeah but i guess until then were lost


we gotta talk about things
we gotta do something different
cause this isnt working this isnt working
i dont i dont know if i can do this
riding round in the city baby
i know you wish you could change me
why you mad girl why you angry
yeah why you angry
back and forth you love you hate me
arguing about the same things
i dont i dont know anymore baby i dont know anymore

yeah i mean she wants somebody thats working a nine point five
i apologise but those aint my hours you aint never been with a man
whos working this kinda job who works for this kind of drive i wouldnt be with me either
hold up yeah i think thats work on the other line i gotta go we can argue some another time
hang up the phone i regret it right after
this is the chance that i couldnt just pass up
see i signed a deal you say that i shouldve asked ya
i guess i was scared to see how you reacted
and maybe i knew id be selfish
these are the things i aint proud of
im always the type to get jealous theres always two sides to the story
and youre not the one that i blame when i tell it thats real yeah
you aint the one you aint the one
i mean i shouldve manned up and thats hard to say as a man
the older i get the more i understand a relationships more than just holding her hand
im sorry you can blame me yeah you can blame me

whats going on
i just wanna feel something i just wanna feel something
theres too many things im tryna deal with
and i understand that you dont feel this
i said theres too many things im tryna deal with
and i understand im hurting your feelings
i know you dont feel this yeah
im just expressing the way that im feeling
the things that im trying to deal with
i guess ive been trying to hold it all inside
but its obvious that aint working
yeah its obvious that aint working
the only thing we got in common
is that we got nothing in common baby


yo i dont know what its like to be addicted to pills
but i do know what its like to be a witness it kills
mama told me she loved me im thinkin this isnt real
i think of you when i get a whiff of that cigarette smell yeah
welcome to the bottom of hell
they say pain is a prison let me out of my cell
you say you proud of me but you dont know me that well
sit in my room tears runnin down my face and i yell
into my pillowcases say you comin to get us
then call a minute later just to tell us youre not im humiliated
im in a room with a parent that i dont barely know
some lady in the corner watchin us while shes takin notes
i dont get it mom dont you want to watch your babies grow
i guess pills are more important all you have to say is no
but you wont do it will you you gon keep poppin til them pills kill you
i know youre gone but i can still feel you

i got this picture in my room and it kills me
but i dont need a picture of my mom i need the real thing

instead you left us at the window waitin
where you at mom

yeah i know them drugs have got you held captive
i can see it in your eyes they got your mind captured
some say its fun to get the high but i am not laughin
and what you dont realize and what youre not graspin
that i was nothin but a kid who couldnt understand it
i aint gon say that i forgive you cause it hasnt happened
i thought that maybe id feel better as time passes
if you really cared for me then where you at then

our last conversation you and i sat in the livin room
talkin bout my music and i brought you some to listen to
you started cryin tellin me this isnt you
a couple weeks later guess you were singin a different tune
you took them pills for the last time didnt you
they took you from us once i guess they came back to finish you
cryin my eyes out in the studio is difficult
music is the only place that i can go to speak to you
it took everything inside of me not to scream at your funeral
sittin in my chair that person talkin was pitiful
i wish you were here mama but every time i picture you
all i feel is pain i hate the way i remember you
they found you on the floor i could tell you felt hollow
gave everything you had plus your life to them pill bottles
you gave everything you had plus your life to them pill bottles
dont know if you hear me or not but if youre still watchin why

how you gon say you the best in the game when you sound like you dont even know how to rap
i used to hand out my demos at shows like listen to me
this aint what it seems
i never sleep which is funny cause im out here living the dream
you say you livin the dream no you just live in the dream
yall need to wake up and get out of yo beds
and quit sleepin on me
i got my head in the game you know what that means
oh yeah you know what that means
they got no clue they got no clue
i thought i already told you before this is all that i do agh


only time you ever call me is when you feelin like dont nobody else wanna listen
whens the last time you saw me
you probably dont remember that cause that was back then you were different
i dont wanna hear the sorrys
im tired of all the talkin to be honest i would rather see a difference
yeah you pass me in the hallway
but you aint say a word to me
lately all i ever feel is distant
you dont care that you lost me
whats wrong with ya
had a picture of you sittin on the dash in the car with me
now its in my closet with the other ones sittin in a box
i dont wanna open up
you took it all from me
told me you would die for me
yeah all you ever do is lie to me
wish that i could say that this has come as surprise see to me
told me that i never took the time and now you aint got the time for me
yeah

we used to talk like best friends
i remember that i guess i dont know what happened to us
now you got me questionin what trust is
you told me you would be there for me
yeah but you aint really mean it did ya
now you wanna jump ship
leave me here alone
well im used to it
everybody else did
who you havin fun with
dont tell me i dont wanna know every time i ask i just feel sick
youre the one that jumped in
told me you had some feelins
now you tryin to tell me that is not true
i aint gotta clue
who im lookin at right now but i know the person that im lookin at is not you
they say that you are who you hang with
maybe thats the reason you been changin
maybe thats the reason why im feelin like youre dangerous
and every time we talk its like im talkin to a stranger


i grew up in a small place had to drive an hour just to see a movie
im a simple person city life just doesnt move me
id rather be home with my grandparents and playing euchre
didnt wanna leave but this dreams calling i had to do it
i left my girl there wish i wouldve done it different
she was right when she told me that i dont ever listen
i told her i would change a million times and never did it
apologies dont mean a thing if you dont ever fix it
i love what i do but its not what i expected
this industry is not your friend well thats my perspective
sometimes the closest people to you make you feel protected
but those are the same people that hurt you most and leave you guessing
some people say nobodys perfect but expect perfection
how you supposed to find the answer if you dont ask the question
sometimes i look into the mirror and talk to my reflection
when i go home and turn the music off what am i left with

we used to be close but as time passed we became disconnected
you never felt love and i always felt disrespected
your family thought i was a joke i was always defensive
they just wanted what was best for you i just couldnt accept it
and hurting you was not a part of my plan or my intentions
but i was immature i guess i had to learn some lessons
we grew apart and our lives went in different directions
and theres a lot of responsibilities that i neglected
i had a lot that was bottled inside couldnt express it
and this pain wont leave i can feel the depression
its taking over my body feels like im always stressing
doctor told me i should sleep but im always restless
i lay awake at night and think my thoughts are relentless
i need a moment to breathe i need a moment to vent this
i seem to be the only person that i play pretend with
and when i turn the music off what am i really left with huh


started with phone conversation and i
flew out to see you its raining outside
we sat by the water and talked about life
oh
said you lost your dad girl i know how that feels
i lost my mom tryna deal with that still
i guess we connect on our hatred for pills
its real

you got me thinking things i never used to
im not the phone type id rather be with you
sometimes i hold back from saying i miss you
but i miss you
i have to admit on this road i get lonely
but you make me smile every time that you call me
you let me be myself
you dont control me

laying in my bed im just staring at the ceiling baby
i just wanna know if you feel what im feeling baby
got you on my mind yeah tell me what the deal is lately
yeah deal is lately deal is lately
im a man of my word girl believe that
im a closed book but somehow you learn to read that
know that i should relax hate the way i react
thinking that im good but you know im bout to relapse
girl i wake up in the morning all i can think of is you

everybody got opinions let it go into my ear and then i block that
put me on stage ima rock that
sayin you the best stop that
phony i am not that yeah

i aint saying im the best but i should be in the top ten give me a list of names ima top them
im just playing with ya i dont care where the top is
leave me at the bottom let me work for it
you aint never gonna find another rapper in the game and tell me that he works more
tell me that he works more nah
you might see me with my hoodie up i aint leaving til i finish
this industry aint nothing but a box but i aint gon climb in it
you put me inside a room full of rappers come back in five minutes
ima be the only one still alive with a note on my chest saying that i did it
you do it for fame we are way different
yall are looking weak we aint cooking in the same kitchen
everybody got a shirt with a stain in it
some of usll never wear it out though lemme get it
i guess i dont understand
this wasnt part of my plan
some of these people theyre thinking cause they heard the name that they really know who i am
bring the beat down
i got no time for these hollywood people id rather give time to my fans
youd rather chill with these women that like you for money
but id rather chill with my fam yeah
im out here grindin
yeah i see the mic but you looking like a pilot
whats the point of a plane if you dont know how to fly it
yeah

rise of the underdog i dont like none of yall
im not like one of yall
im from the jungle i run with the son of god
yeah what is you running for
they should be running from me
most of my family we dont even speak
im getting married in twentytwo weeks
and they still havent said hi or wanted to meet huh
im not the type to complain
if we dont get it we try it again
and id die for the gang misfit my blood
they dont like us and we question they mom like
why didwhy did you allow your kid to like bad music
woo promise i do it
im tryna give you my everything
i dont care what they are doing
im tryna do what they couldnt do
laugh at the rappers you look up to
dont waste time with the centerfolds
im alive its a miracle
freestylin since middle school
i will battle the principal
wear all black like a funeral
im doing me i dont live for you
grindin


when i die put my ashes in a trash bag
i dont care where they go
dont waste your money on my gravestone
im more concerned about my soul
everybodys gon die
dont everybody live though
sometimes i look up to the sky
and wonder

listen yeah everybody wants change
dont nobody wanna change though
dont nobody wanna pray
til they got something to pray for
know everybodys gon die
but dont everybody live though

its easy to blame god but harder to fix things
we look in the sky like why aint you listening
watchin the news in our livin rooms on the big screens
and talking bout if gods really real then where is he
you see the same god that were sayin might not even exist
becomes real to us but only when we dyin in bed
when youre healthy its like we dont really care for him then
leave me alone god ill call you when i need you again
which is funny everyone will sleep in the pews
then blame god for our problems like hes sleeping on you
we turn our backs on him what do you expect him to do
its hard to answer prayers when nobodys prayin to you
i look around at this world we walk on
its a smack in the face dont ever tell me theres no god
and if there isnt then what are we here for
and what are yall doing down there i dont know lord


yeah i got off stage like a month ago
i was talking to fans
and one of em pulled me aside and said
we never met but i swear that you know who i am
ive been through a lot
i dont know how to express it to people dont think that i can
but i got that mansion cd on rotation
thats real for me nate you do not understand
its crazy for me
kids hit me up say they slittin they wrists on the daily
this music is more than you think
dont book me for just entertainment its entertainin
hearin these parents they telling their kids
my music is violentyou gotta be kidding me
i guess that your definition of violence and mine
is something that we look at differently
how do you picture me huh
want me to smile you want me to laugh
you want me to walk on the stage with a smile on my face
when im mad and put on a mask for real though
i mean what you expect from me
im tryna do this respectfully
they say that life is a race
i knew my problems would prolly catch up eventually
i do my best to be calm
how you gon write me and tell me youd slaughter my family
thats just a glimpse to the stuff that gets sent to me
these are the parts of my life they dont never see woo
i am aware its aggressive
i am not here for acceptance
i dont know what you expected
but what you expect when you walk in a therapy session huh

this girl at the show looked me in the face
and told me her lifes full of drama
said her dad is abusive
apparently he likes to beat on her mama
i got so angry inside
i wanted to tell her to give me his number
but what you gon do with it right
you gon hit him up then hell start hittin her harder thats real
these kids they come to my shows
with tears in they eyes
imagine someone looking at you
and sayin your musics the reason that they are alive
sometimes i dont know how to handle it
this type of life isnt glamorous
this aint an act for the cameras
you see me walk on these stages
but have no idea what im dealing with after it nah
i put it all in the open
this is the way that i cope with all my emotion
im taking pictures with thousands of people
but honestly i feel like nobody knows me
im tryin to deal with depression
im tryin to deal with the pressure
how you gon tell me my music does not have a message
when im lookin out at this crowd full of people i know i affected agh
i got some things in my life
i know i should let em go
let me jot it down
let me take a mental note
i put it all in this microphone
think about that for a minute
what is the point of this song im just ventin
but what you expect from a therapy session huh

what you think about me
that doesnt worry me
i know i handle some things immaturely
i know that i need to grow in maturity
i aint gon walk on these stages in front of these people
and act like i live my life perfectly
that doesnt work for me
christian is not the definition of what perfect means woo
i aint the type to be quiet
i aint gon sit here in silence
if i wouldnt say what i say to your face
then i promise you i wouldnt say it in private
i am not lyin
people go off on my page and im tryin to quit the replyin
but this is ridiculous
im passionate man i really mean what im writing
you want me to keep it a hundred
okay ill keep it a hundred
i see a whole lot of talkin on socials
but honestly i dont see nothing in public
i kinda love it yeah
why dont you write us some happy raps
that would be awesome
all of your music is moody and dark nate
dont get me started
you wanna know what its like if you met me in person
this music is not just for people
who sit in the pews and pray at the churches nah
i wont reject it
i dont expect everyone to respect it
i dont expect you to get my perspective
but what you expect from a therapy session
huh


yeah whats your definition of success
i dont trust the thoughts that come inside my head
i dont trust this thing that beats inside my chest
who i am and who i wanna be cannot connect why
dont think i deserve it you get no respect
i just made a couple mil still not impressed
let you down goes triple platinum yeah okay okay i guess
smile for a moment then these questions startin to fill my head not again
i push away the people that i love the most why
i dont want no one to know im vulnerable why
that makes me feel weak and so uncomfortable why
stop askin me questions i just wanna feel alive
until i diethis isnt nates flow
just let me rhyme im in disguise
im a busy person got no time for lies one of a kind
they dont see it i pull out they eyes im on the rise
ive been doin this for most my life with no advice
take my chances i just roll the dice do what i like
as a kid i was afraid of heights put that aside
now im here and they look so surprised well so am i woo
they dont invite me to the parties but i still arrive
kick down the door and then i go inside
give off that i do not belong here vibe
then take the keys right off the counter lets go for a ride
why do yall look mortified
i keep to myself they think im sorta shy organized
let you downs the only song youve heard of well then youre behind
story time wish that i could think like big sean does but i just cant decide
if i should stick my knife inside of pennywise
i i dont care what anybody else thinkslies
i do not need nobody to help melies
i kinda feel guilty cause im wealthy why
i dont understand its got me questionin like why
just tell me whynot back to this flow
inside i feel divided
back when i aint had a dime but had the drive
back before i ever signed i questioned life like who am i man woo
nothin to mes ever good enough
i could be workin for twenty four hours a day and think i never did enough
my life is a movie but there aint no tellin what youre gonna see in my cinema
i wanna be great but i get in the way of myself and i think about everything that i could never be
why do i do it though ayy yeah
why you always lookin aggravated
not a choice you know i had to make it
when they talk about the greatest they gon probably never put us in the conversation
like somethin then i gotta take it
write somethin then i might erase it
i love it then i really hate it
whats the problem nathan i dont know
i know i like to preach to always be yourself
but my emotions make me feel like i am someone else
me and pride had made a pact that we dont need no help
which feels like im at war inside myself but i forgot the shells
i hold my issues up for all to see like show and tell
a lot of people know me but not a lot know me well
hold my issues up for all to see like show and tell
a lot of people know me but they dont know me well


only time you ever call me is when you feelin like dont nobody else wanna listen
whens the last time you saw me
you probably dont remember that cause that was back then you were different
i dont wanna hear the sorrys
im tired of all the talkin to be honest i would rather see a difference
yeah you pass me in the hallway
but you aint say a word to me
lately all i ever feel is distant

whats wrong with ya

yeah
my name buzzin aint no way you could ignore it
i did not come this far so they could ignore me
i am not the one to say ill do it in the mornin
id rather get it done dont focus on whats not important
they try to talk to me like they been nothin but supportive
appreciate the love but do not show up on my doorstep
if you aint about that real i suggest that you avoid me
if we aint on the same page thats the end of story agh
you are not a baller cause your closets full of jordans
you are not a rich man cause youre on the forbes list
first i drop the record then you know i gotta tour it
reals still the slogan only difference is theres more of us
the story of my life feels like its just beginnin now
i ask you a question i want answers not the run around
you the one that brought it up but im the one to shut it down
if you aint got the album yet i brought you one im at your house
hey

i know where im goin i dont let no one distract me
i dont need directions from nobody in the back seat
i dont need these people in my corner tryna gas me
id rather have people in my corner tryna check me
yeah i walk off the bus a different city than the last week
let the fans speak they gon tell you bout the past me
if im bein honest last year i was in a bad place
wouldnt say im out of it but dont feel like i cant be agh
who you know droppin clean records but they nasty
i was made for this i could tell when mama had me
i hopped right off the table told my doctor i aint average
he asked me what does that mean
i told him get the pen and pad please
whod a known id write something that could change lives
i dont think yall fully understand the way you changed mine
i look at the future thats in front of me with both eyes
three records three years i dont like to waste time
oh yeah


im the type to rent a hotel room just to feel at home
im the type to rent a hotel room just to be alone
i got an issue with people pretending they like what they dont
please dont bring up my issues unless you gon deal with your own
please dont try to pretend like you keep it real though
yeah its funny that you got a lotta money
but that money doesnt buy you skills though
i dont care if i am on the billboards
on a killing spree im about to kill more
got a chain on you paid a mill for
i mean what you people even live for
i write raps you steal yours oh lord
we just getting warmed up
yeah i said i was coming i warned you
so close to the fans
i feel like they ride on my tour bus
you wanna know what i do in my downtime
they come to my fortress
i apologize for all the corpses
its a mess right now
but i havent had time to put the rappers in the coffins
we aint talked in like six years
why you writing me now
i just turned one point zerok down
just to keep the brand looking right now
i aint bragging about the money
im just saying i aint controlled by the bank account
or the bank amounts
im a business man
but dont touch my money
i dont play around woo
lights out when the mics out
about to hit the west coast
hype crowds
i just put a record out
what you think im gonna pipe down
nah ive been looking for a beat
look what i found woo
i mean everything is coming out of my mouth
tried to tell me yeah i aint had the right sound
oh yeah well
tell me what you think now
two records in the bag i aint done though
whats coming next year
let me hear the drum roll
dont flow
anybody wanna be the one to make an issue out of nothing
imma hit you with my iphone
i know
im a little out of hand now
i aint looking for a handout
you aint like what i was doing last year
which is funny cause you lookin like a fan now
are you a fan now
i kinda miss being broke
now let me go back to my old days
when i used to walk into high school
and hand out my cd in hallways
i told all my teachers that id be a rapper
they smiled and looked at me okay thats a pretty nice dream but you better get a real job
mm no way
yeah i live what you dreamin
i could do this while im sleepin
i aint the type that will bring up your name for nothing
but please dont give me a reason
im on the edge now i aint playin with you
never really been a fan of takin pictures
im just being honest yeah ill take it with you
shows sellin out better get your tickets oh lord
i got a love for the fans
i cant express what it feels like
sometimes i wonder if its even real life
sometimes i look at the past and think about how i got here in the first place
you know the glove is my birthplace
i dont wanna be rude
but i could get you on my worst days
say nothing for me
do it all the time
yeah they barely workin while im workin overtime
last year they like who am i
now this year they like you the guy
heres a little something for your car rides
if they said i fell off they all lied
yeah you know the logo
better recognize
yeah its real music til the day we die
yah


feels like im in the sky
flying over clouds or somethin
i dont smoke weed but you could say im high on somethin
its like this music is my addiction i call it my nicotine
what youre witnessing is an addicted fiend and it sickens me
just a lame as how you picture me
give me that microphone and im gonna rip it so viciously
aint you hearing the chemistry
aint it ironic i brought up chemistry
cuz i was never good at math but im ill with the melodies

since i was a kid i had a dream that i would make it
i spent thousands of hours writing music in that basement
even though im broke you know why i still chase it
cuz once you get a taste of it there is no replacement
yo i dont rap so millions of people will like me
i rap cuz theres millions of people just like me
if you think im out of my mind i aint gonna argue i might be
but im not on the stage just for people to sightsee

when i step into that studio feels like im in my house
if you listen to my music than you know what im about
no i aint never been the type to just sit around on the couch
i get lost in these beats till my body passes out
lets rewind
what ever happened to music that meant something
cuz nowadays i look around and music dont mean nothin
and to be honest whats really making me sick to my stomach
is everybodys runnin around screaming they love it

a lotta people think they understand the music biz
i am not a genius but at least i know what music is
put a cd on the shelf and you thinkin youll be filthy rich
but you just become the definition of what filthy is
the music me and her weve been through a lot together
and i can tell somethin aint right if we are not together
and yo god gave me the story so we plot together
i get shot whatever this is who i am remember


all i ever wanted was somebody to hear me
and all i ever wanted was somebody to feel me
and everybody wanna tell me that im out of my head
when im on the mic thats fine but that dont scare me
its been a long time but im back now
rap pow welcome to the rap house
rap pow will live til i pass out
blackout blackout everybody keep on wonderin if i still rap now
are you serious
anybody out there hearin this
yo i came in the game as a lyricist
and ima leave like that period
you sniff lines i write lines
youve now entered in my mind
and you better get ready cause you might find
im from a different place and my kind
its a little bit different than yours is
quit snoring hip hop isnt dead
its just been in mournin
from the moment i quit recording
quick record this
listen im warming up and youre misinformed if
you think that im slipping up this aint sick enough
all i ever wanted was somebody to get this
all i ever wanted was somebody to play this
yeah take my song put it on their playlist
and get goosebumps every time they play it rate us
if thats my calling or not father maybe i should just not bother
go back to that nine to five but i am not a
quitter so quit that
i never been a killer but i guarantee i kill tracks
put them in a coffin lost in rip that
tryin to make an impact in rap is that insane
well i guess so
rap though better give me that pencil
and you aint ever gonna make it its all mental
i am in a place where i cant let go agh
i still work a job and do this and yall know whats stupid
i thought all you had to do was get a record deal and your things start moving
but thats not the case because most of the timesthe artists you hear
you keep on thinking that artist is new but that artist has prolly been at it for years
yeah in the back of my mind thinking am i wasting my time dreamin
and i aint got no money in my wallet but i guarantee there aint no way that i am gonna leave this
i need this i swear to yall i need this
and this hip hops in my veins if you cut me ima bleed it
and yo what you think i write raps for no reason no
take my pain and i put em in a songever since them pills they took my mom
what youre hearing now is me whether im in front or behind that curtain
i stand behind these words here im a christian but im not perfect
dont tell me to calm down im calm now listen im just working
yeah it might take a minute to get it but once you get it everything will be crystal clear
i dont think they see my vision here i dont think they see my vision here

dont tell me that this isnt real
this is all that i have this is all that i have


you make a lot of money and you live in a mansion
and pretty much got everything that you could ever imagine
but you feel like even though you got everything in the world
you got nothing
so what you do then is you start going backwards
you runnin in a direction
and you lookin for something that isnt real
and all you know is that you just gotta have it
what youre doin is sleepin
and thinking that youre awake and youre not
and the problem is that you dont know what youre after
so you put everything that you have into what you do
hoping that one day maybe you dont have to feel like youre empty
but as you get older a lot of weight on your shoulders is getting heavy
then you look back and you start to regret things
you only get one life
and every time you lookin at yours
you feel like everything you have is a waste
and the problem and the reason you could never fill a hole in your life
is because you were never awake

you wake up in the morning
but you feel like you never got up and go to work
and you feelin like you aint got a purpose
and you tryna get motivated but everything you do turns into a mess
like you aint nothing but worthless
and yo you look around
a lot of these other people you lookin at
to you you describe as perfect
so you point a finger at god and tell him to do his job
and fix ya life up cause nothin is workin
and you will try to hide it and make it seem like its nothin
but really you feel like everything is crashin around you
and you developed a problem in trusting in other people
which later became an issue that would mentally pound you
but every time you lookin at yours you feel like all you ever see are mistakes
and the problem and the reason you could never move forward in life
is because you were never awake
wake up


check check ayy listen
yo love is like a drug that everybody uses
you wanna know the outcomedepends on how you use it
love could be your best friend love could be your enemy
love could be the thing you wish you had but you dont ever see
and love can be the reason why youre afraid to have it
some say it like it means something others its a habit
and some would say its tragic and some would say its beautiful
some would say its black and its dark like a funeral
and some would die for it some dont think its even real
some say they understand but really dont know how it feels
some say that its alive some say that it can kill
but most of us that been in it know that sometimes it will
i aint gonna sugarcoat it yet sometimes it might surround you
one minute its savin you next its tryin to drown you
some people want to show it but were never taught how to
and some of us is searchin feelin like it never found you

yo love is like a privilege a lot of us abuse it
do with it what we want and then start drama when we lose it
pretend like it aint nothing to us pretend that its useless
and we dont know why we do this but yet we still pursue it
and love it can consume you turn you into something else
bury the real you so deep that you cant even find yourself
love it can change you love it can tear you down
be the best thing you ever had and kick you on the ground
yo you get on that high level yet you scared to fall
cause you know if that person hurts you you gon lose it all
they told you they would be there for you they dont even call
so that openness you used to have has now become a wall
and some say that its patient some say that its kind
i dont think its invisible but i know that its blind
to some its only physical or all up in their mind
see it probably isnt there if youre strugglin to find it

this love has got me down low now i guess im up high
one minute im on the ground next minute im in the sky
i feel invincible and so unrejected
forget it im invisible and i feel unprotected
yo i dont need nobody else trust me im fine
i cant do this by myself im losing my mind
yeah i can see clearly forget it im blind
my heart says danger cant you read the signs
yo but through all the pain i swear i love it
no matter what you do it dont disappear does it
yo id rather spend a minute with love in my life
than go a million years without knowing what its like
you better grab it you dont wanna lose it
and yeah it brings pain its insane but the bruises
my god can take that all away youll find that right person
and everything you thought that wasnt becomes worth it


you put your hand into mine and baby we flew
and whenever youre not around i dont know what to do
and id rather die than go on living without you
youre the one for me

i put my hand into yours and baby i knew
that you would be there no matter what we go through
youre not alone ill always be there for you
cause youre the one for me

youre the only one only one
that is gonna hold us up
i got you and after all that weve been through
weve been through some things
but its okay okay
theres no way im leaving
baby believe it

girl i dont want to sound like im on repeat
i know that it sounds like it might seem weak
been through too much i know it aint easy
to look at my face its difficult when you see this
hey we been falling apart and weve been trying to fix this
im hoping and wishing that things will be different
i dont want to lose you i know that i miss this
cause youre the only one on my mind i listen to


and yo i started from the bottom no drake though yeah i came in the game like hello
i came in the game like lets go

ill never be picture perfect beyoncé
be light as al b or black as chauncey
remember him from blackstreet he was black as the street was
ill never be laid back as this beat was
i never could see why peoplell reach a
fake ass facade that they couldnt keep up
you see how i creeped up
you see how i played a big role in chicago like queen latifah
ill never rock a mink coat in the winter time like killa cam
or rock some mink boots in the summertime like william
let me know if you feel it man
cause everything im not made me everything i am

and im back to tear it up
haters start your engines i hear em gearing up
people talk so much shit about me at barbershops
they forget to get their hair cut
okay fair enough the streets is flaring up
cause they want gun talk or i dont wear enough
baggy clothes reeboks or a di dos

so say goodbye to the naacp award
goodbye to the india arie award
theyd rather give me the n nigga please award

i met this girl when i was three years old
and what i loved most she had so much soul
she said excuse me lil homie i know you dont know me
but my name is windy and i like to blow trees
and from that point i never blow her off
niggas come from out of town i like to show her off
they like to act tough she like to tore em off
and make em straighten up their hat cause she know they soft
and when i grew up she showed me how to go downtown in
the nighttime her face lit up so astoundin
i told her in my heart is where shell always be
she never messed with entertainers cause they always leave
she said it felt like they walked and drove on me
knew i was gang affiliated got on tv and told on me
i guess thats why last winter she got so cold on me
she said ye keep makin that keep makin that platinum and gold for me

but if you really cared for her
then you wouldntve never hit the airport to follow your dreams
sometimes i still talk to her
but when i talk to her it always seems like she talkin bout me
she said you left your kids and they just like you
they wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
but they just not you and i just got through
talkin bout what niggas tryin to do just not new
now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
i guess you never know what you got til its gone
i guess thats why im here and i cant come back home
and guess when i heard that when i was back home
every interview im representin you makin you proud
reach for the stars so if you fall you land on a cloud
jump in the crowd spark your lighters wave em around
if you dont know by now im talkin bout chi town

while yall was in limbo i raised the bar up
i touched on everything
married to the game rock a chain steada wedding ring
yall bridesmaids catch the garter
on nights when ye romance
cameras flash so much
that i gotta do that yayo dance
im on a world tour with common my man
after each and every show a couple dykes in the van
its easy
the hood love to listen to jeezy and weezy
and oh yeah yeezy
i did it for the glory

what am i supposed to do now
man the game all messed up
how im suppose to stand out when everybody get dressed up
so yeah at the grammys i went ultra travolta
yeah that tuxedo might have been a little guido
but with my ego
i can stand there in a speedo
and be looked at like a fucking hero
the glory the story the chain the polo the night
the grind the empty bottles of no doz
tank on empty whipping my mammas volvo
i spent that gas money on clothes with logos
the fur is hermes shit that you dont floss
the goyard so hard man im hugos boss
why i gotta ask what that tudor cost
house on the hill
two doors from tracey ross
and im asking about her girlfriends
yeah the dark skined ones
she asking about the speed boats yeah i admit we rented em
when you meet me in person what do you feel like
i know i know i look better in real life
i hear people compare themselves to big a lot
you know big and pac you know to get it hot
i guess after i live i wanna be compared to big
any one big pun big l or notorious
till then get money and stunt and stay glorious


you dont see just how wild the crowd is
you dont see just how fly my style is
i dont see why i need a stylist
when i shop so much i can speak italian
i dont know i just want it better for my kids
and i aint sayin we was from the projects
but every time i wanted layaway or a deposit
my dadd say when you see clothes close your eyelids
we was sort of like will smith and his son
in the movie i aint talkin bout the rich ones
cause every summer hed get some
brand new harebrained scheme to get rich from
and i dont know what he did for dough
but hed send me back to school with a new wardrobe

when it feel like livings harder than dyin
for me givin ups way harder than tryin
lauryn hill said her heart was in zion
i wish her heart still was in rhymin
cause who the kids gon listen to huh
i guess me if it isnt you
last week i paid a visit to the institute
they got the dropout keepin kids in the school
i guess i cleaned up my act like princed do
if not for pleasure then at least for the principle
they got the cd they got to see me
drop gems like i dropped out of pe
they used to feel invisible
now they know they invincible


its the hard knock life tour sellout
picture us in the mall coppin iceberg and yell out jigga
yeah thats what well yell out yell out
you know the name do i gotta spell out or tell bout
j a y and ye so shy
now he wont even step to his idol to say hi
standing there like a mime and let the chance pass by
back of my mind he could change your life
with all these beats i did at least let him hear it
at least you can brag to ya friends back at the gig
but he got me out me out my momma crib
then he help me get my momma a crib

fresh off the plane im off to baseline
nothing handed out im bout to take mine
round the same time of that blueprint one
and these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
id play my little songs in that old back room
hed bob his head and say damn oh thats you
but by the black album i was blacking out
partyin sobs and we had packed a crowd
big brother got his show up at madison square
and im like yeah yeah we gon be there but
not only did i not get a chance to spit it
carline told me i could buy two tickets
i guess big brother was thinkin a little different
and kept little brother at bay at a distance
but everything that i felt was more bogus
only made me more focused only wrote more potent
only thing i wanna know is why i get looked over
i guess ill understand when i get more older
big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
now im on the top and everybody on the scrotum

have you ever walked in the shadow of a giant
not only a client the presidito hola hovito
the game gettin foul so heres a free throw
i was always on the other side of the peephole
then i dropped jesus walks now im on the steeple
and we know new jack city got to keep my brother
but to be number one imma beat my brother
on that diamonds remix i swore i spazzed
then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
sibling rivalry only i could see
it was the pride in me that was drivin me
at the grammys i said i inspired me
but my big brother who i always tried to be
when i kicked a flow it like pick and roll
cause even if he gave me the rock its give and go
i guess beanies style was more of a slam dunk
but my shit was more like a finger roll
but i had them singles though
and them hoes at the show gonna mingle yo heh yall know
i told jay i did a song with coldplay
next thing i know he got a song with coldplay
back in my mind im like damn no way
translate español no way josé
then i went and told jay brown
shoulda known that was gonna come back around
shoulda talked to you like a man shoulda told you first
but i told somebody else and thats what made shit worse


driving around town looking for the best spot
for the drunk and hot girls
up in the club look at here what we got
some drunk and hot girls

that drunk and hot girl


i had a dream i could buy my way to heaven
when i awoke i spent that on a necklace
i told god id be back in a second
man its so hard not to act reckless
to whom much is given much is tested

i feel the pressure under more scrutiny
and what i do act more stupidly
bought more jewelry more louis v
my momma couldnt get through to me
the drama people suing me
im on tv talking like its just you and me

but i couldnt tell ya who decide wars
so i parallel double parked that motherfucker sideways
old folks talking bout back in my day

and say something when you gon end up apologing
let me know if its a problem then aight man holla then

let the champagne splash let that man get cash
let that man get past
he dont even stop to get gas
if he can move through the rumors he can drive off of fumes cause
how he move in a room full of nos
how he stay faithful in a room full of hoes
must be the pharaohs he in tune with his soul
so when he buried in a tomb full of gold
treasure whats your pleasure
life is a uh depending how you dress her
so if the devil wear prada adam eve wear nada
im in between but way more fresher
with way less effort cause when you try hard
thats when you die hard
your homies looking like why god

and its all because of you girl we through
you think your shit dont stank but you are mrs pee yew
and i dont see you with me no more
now tell everybody that you know that you know


on lonely nights i start to fade
her loves a thousand miles away

its four am and i cant sleep
her love is all that i can see

if spring can take the snow away
can it melt away all our mistakes


its so crazy crazy crazy
i got everything figured out
but for some reason
i can never find what real love is about no doubt
everything in the world figured out
but i can never seem to find what real love was about
do you think id sacrifice real life
for all the fame and flashing lights
do you think id sacrifice a real life
there is no gucci i can buy
there is no louis vuitton to put on
there is no ysl that they could sell
to get my heart out of this hell and my mind out of this jail
there is no clothes that i could buy
that could turn back in time
there is no vacation spot i could fly
that could bring back a piece of real life
real life what does it feel like
i ask you tonight i ask you tonight
what does it feel like i ask you tonight
to live a real life

its funny
pinocchio lied and thats what kept him from it
i tell the truth and i keep running
its like im lookin for something out there tryna find something
i turn on the tv and see me and see nothing
what does it feel like to live real life to be real
not some facade on tv that no one can really feel
do you really have the stamina
for everybody that sees you that say wheres my camera
for everybody that sees you to say sign a autograph
for everybody that sees you cryin that say you oughta laugh
you oughta laugh

and there is no gepetto to guide me
no one right beside me
the only one was behind me
i cant find her no more i cant call her no more
i cant
the only one that come out on the tour and stays
back when i was livin at home and this was all a big dream
and the fame will be get got
and the day i moved to la maybe that was all my fault
all my fault to be a real boy chasin the american dream
chasin everything we seen up on the tv screen
and when uh the benz was left
and the clothes was left and the hoes was left
you talk the hoes to death thinkin the money that the 
you spend the dough to death
and tell me what be left for a real boy
they say kanye you keep it too real boy
perspective and wise man say
one day youll find your way
the wise man say youll find your way
wise man say


im not loving you way i wanted to
what i had to do had to run from you
im in love with you but the vibe is wrong
and that haunted me all the way home
so you never know never never know
never know enough til its over love
til we lose control system overload
screaming no no no n noo
see i wanna move but cant escape from you
so i keep it low keep a secret code
so everybody else dont have to know

i cant keep my cool so i keep it true
i got something to lose so i gotta move
i cant keep myself and still keep you too
so i keep in mind when im on my own
somewhere far from home in the danger zone
how many times did i tell you fore it finally got through

i bet no one knew i got no one new

but im not loving you the way i wanted to
gotta keep it going keep the loving going

and um he was friends with my mentor no id and no id told him look man you wanna mess with kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap

no id yo you wanna sign him tell him you like how he rap


i was all i dunno if he was gassin me or not but hes like he wanna manage me as a rapper and a producer


im like oh shit i was messin with uh d dot also people were like this started talking about the ghost production but thats how i got in the game if it wasnt for that i wouldnt be here so you know after they picked that truth beat i was figuring i was gonna do some more work but shit just wasnt poppin off like that i was stayin in chicago i had my own apartment i be doin like just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on and then to go out and buy get a pelle pelle off lay away get some jordans or something or get a technomarine thats what we wore back then
i made this one beat where i sped up this harold melvin sample i played it for hip over the phone hes like oh yo that shit is crazy jay might want it for this compilation album he doin called the dynasty and at that time like the drums really werent soundin right to me so i went and um i was listening to dre chronic two point one at that time and really i just like bit the drums off xxplosive and put it like with a sped up sample and now its kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on this cant be life

and that was like really the first beat of that kind that was on the dynasty album i could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound you know i got to come in and track the beat and at the time i was still with my other management i really wanted to roll with hip hop cause i i just needed some fresh air you know what im sayin cause i been there for a while i appreciated what they did for me but you know theres a time in every mans life where he gotta make a change try to move up to the next level and that day i came and i tracked the beat and i got to meet jay z and he said oh you a real soulful dude


and i was like man that shit tight you know what im sayin man what ima tell him i was on the train man you know so after that i went back home and man im im just in chicago im trying to do my thing you know i got groups i got acts im trying to get on and like there wasnt nothin really like poppin off the way it should have been one of my homies that was one of my artists he got signed but it was supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the company so like im just straight holdin the phone gettin the bad news that dude was tryin to leave my company and i got evicted at the same time so i went down and tracked the beats from him i took that money came back packed all my shit up in a u haul maybe about ten days before i had to actually get out so i aint have to deal with the landlord cause hes a jerk me and my mother drove to


i unpacked all my shit you know we went to ikea i bought a bed i put the bed together myself i loaded up all my equipment and the first beat i made was uh heart of the city and beans was still working on his album at that time so i came up there to baseline it was beans birthday matter of fact and i played like seven beats and you know i guess he was in the zone he already had the beats that he wanted i had did nothing like it already at that time but then jay walked in i remember he had a gucci bucket hat on i remember it like like it was yesterday and hip hop said yo play that one beat for him and i played heart of the city and really i made heart of the city i really wanted to give that beat to dmx


and i played another beat and i played another beat and i remember that gucci bucket he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like ooh two days later im in baseline and i seen dame dame didnt know who i was and i was like yo whats up im kanye


you that kid that gave all them beats to jay yo this nigga got classics to your beats


you know i aint talkin shit im like oh shit and all this time im starstruck man im still thinking bout you know im picturing these niggas on the show the streets is watching im lookin these were superstars in my eyes and they still are you know so jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day and in two days i gotta bring up one thing you know come back to the story the day i did the cant be life beat on track i remember lenny s he had some louis vuitton sneakers on he think he fly and hip hop was there i think ty ty john meneilly a bunch of people i didnt know all these people at the time they was in the room and i said yo jay i could rap and i spit this rap that said uh im killin yall niggas on that lyrical shit mayonnaise colored benz i push miracle whips and i saw his eyes light up when i said that line but you know the rest the rap was like real wack and shit so thats all the response he said man that was tight


that was it you know i aint get no deal then hehe okay fast forward so blueprint h to the izzo my first hit single and i just took that proudly built relationships with people my relationship with kweli i think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper because you know of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him man i appre   i love him for that and at this time you know i didnt have a deal i had songs and i had relationships with all these ars and they wanted beats from me so theyd call me up id play them some beats gimme a beat that sound like jay z you know they dick riders whatever so ill play them these post blueprint beats or whatever and then ill play my shit ill be like yo but i rap too hey i guess they was lookin at me crazy cause you know cause i aint have a jersey on or whatever everybody out there listen here i played them jesus walks and they didnt sign me you know what happened it was some ars that fucked with me though but then like the heads itd be somebody at the company thatll say naw like dave lighty fucked with me my nigga mel brought me to a bunch of labels jessica rivera man


im not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up


lets just say i didnt get my deal the nigga that was behind me i mean he wasnt even a nigga you know the person who actually kicked everything off was joe threeh from capitol records he wanted to sign me really bad


dame was like yo you got a deal with capitol okay man just make sure its not wack


then one day i just went ahead and played it i wanted to play some songs cause you know cam was in the room young guru and dame was in the room so i played actually its a song that youll never hear but maybe i might use it so its called wow

i go to jacob with twentyfive thou you go with twentyfive hundred wow
i got eleven plaques on my walls right now
you got your first gold single damn nigga wow


i aint gonna front its kinda hot


like they still werent looking at me like a rapper and im sure dame figured like man if he do a whole album if his raps is wack at least we can throw cam on every song and save the album you know so uh dame took me into the office and hes like yo man b b you dont want a brick you dont want a brick


you gotta be under an umbrella youll get rained on i told hip hop and hip hop was all oh word actually even with that i was still about to take the deal with capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with threeh that you know cause i told him i was gonna do it and im a man of my word i was gonna roll with what i said i was gonna do then you know im not gonna name no names but people told me oh hes just a producer rapper and told threeh that told the heads of the capitol and right   the day im talking about i planned out everything i was gonna do man i had picked out clothes i already started booking studio sessions i started arranging my album thinking of marketing schemes man i was ready to go and they had mel call me they said yo capitol pulled on the deal


and you know i told them that roc a fella was interested and i dont know if they thought that was just something i was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever i went up i called g i said man you think we could still get that deal with roc a fella

so wont you raise your glass wont you

she has no idea what she doin in college
that major that she majored in dont make no money
but she wont drop out her parentsll look at her funny
now tell me that aint insecurr
the concept of school seems so securr
sophomore three yurrs aint picked a carurr
she like fuck it ill just stay down hurr and do hair
cause thats enough money to buy her a few pairs
of new airs cause her baby daddy dont really care
shes so precious with the peer pressure
couldnt afford a car so she named her daughter alexis
she had hair so long that it looked like weave
then she cut it all off now she look like eve
and she be dealin with some issues that you cant believe
single black female addicted to retail and well

man i promise im so self conscious
thats why you always see me with at least one of my watches
rollies and pashas done drove me crazy
i cant even pronounce nothin pass that ver say see
then i spent four hundred bucks on this
just to be like nigga you aint up on this
and i cant even go to the grocery store
without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
it seem we livin the american dream
but the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
the prettiest people do the ugliest things
for the road to riches and diamond rings
we shine because they hate us floss cause they degrade us
we tryna buy back our forty acres
and for that paper look how low well stoop
even if you in a benz you still a nigga in a coupe

i say fuck the police thats how i treat em
we buy our way out of jail but we cant buy freedom
well buy a lot of clothes but we dont really need em
things we buy to cover up whats inside
cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
thats why shortys hollerin where the ballers at
drug dealer buy jordan crackhead buy crack
and the white man get paid off of all of that
but i aint even gon act holier than thou
cause fuck it i went to jacob with twentyfive thou

four hundred years later we buyin our own chains
the light is before us brothers so the devil workin hard

us living as we do upside down
and the new word to have is revolution
people dont even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
because gods whole card has been thoroughly piqued
and america is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
the youngsters who were programmed
to continue fucking up woke up one night
digging paul revere and nat turner as the good guys
america stripped for bed and we had not all yet closed our eyes
the signs of truth were tattooed across our often entered vagina
we learned to our amazement the untold tale of scandal
two long centuries buried in the musty vault
hosed down daily with a gagging perfume
america was a bastard
the illegitimate daughter of the mother country
whose legs were then spread around the world
and a rapist known as freedom free doom
democracy liberty and justice were revolutionary code names
that preceded the bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling bubbling
in the mother countrys crotch
what does webster say about soul
all i want is a good home and a wife
and a children and some food to feed them every night
after all is said and done build a new route to china if theyll have you
who will survive in america


penitentiary chances the devil dances
and eventually answers to the call of autumn
all of them fallin for the love of ballin
got caught with thirty rocks the cop look like alec baldwin
inter century anthems based off inner city tantrums
based off the way we was branded
face it jerome get more time than brandon
and at the airport they check all through my bag
and tell me that its random
but we stay winning this week has been a bad massage
i need a happy ending and a new beginning
and a new fitted and some job opportunities thats lucrative
this the real world homie school finished
they done stole your dreams you dunno who did it
i treat the cash the way the government treats aids
i wont be satisfied til all my niggas get it get it

is hip hop just a euphemism for a new religion
the soul music of the slaves that the youth is missing
but this is more than just my road to redemption
malcolm west had the whole nation standing at attention
as long as im in polo smiling they think they got me
but they would try to crack me if they ever see a black me
i thought i chose a field where they couldnt sack me
if a nigga aint shootin a jump shot running a track meet
but this pimp is at the top of mount olympus
ready for the worlds game this is my olympics
we make em say ho cause the game is so pimpish
choke a south park writer with a fishstick
i insisted to get up offa this dick
and these drugs niggas cant resist it
remind me of when they tried to have ali enlisted
if i ever wasnt the greatest nigga i must have missed it

i need more drinks and less lights
and that american apparel girl in just tights
she told the director she tryna get in a school
he said take them glasses off and get in the pool
its been a while since i watched the tube
cause like a crip set i got way too many blues for any more bad news
i was looking at my resume feeling real fresh today
they rewrite history i dont believe in yesterday
and whats a black beatle anyway a fucking roach
i guess thats why they got me sitting in fucking coach
my guy said i need a different approach
cause people is looking at me like im sniffing coke
its not funny anymore try different jokes
tell em hug and kiss my ass x and o
and kiss the ring while they at it do my thing while i got it
play strings for the dramatic ending of that wack shit
act like i aint had a belt in two classes
i aint got it im coming after whoever who has it
im coming after whoever who has it
you blowin up thats good fantastic
that yall its like that yall
i dont really give a fuck about it at all
cause the same people that tried to black ball me
forgot about two things my black balls

i done copped timbs lived in lenses kid
armani suits fresh fruits bally boots and benzes
counting up smoking one cuff
live as a red jag a louis bag grabbing a blunt fuck it
steam about a hundred and one ls
kites off to jails buying sweats running up in stetson
nigga hat game was special
it matched every black pair of nikes throwing dice for decimals
the older head bolder head would train a soldier head
make sure he right in the field not a soldier dead
that meant code red bent off the black skunk
the black dutch back of the old shed
if you cant live you dying you give or buy in
keep it real or keep it moving keep grinding
keep shining to every young man this is a plan
learn from others like your brothers rae and kanye


maybe its cause she into leos and i was into trios
plus all the trips to rio couldnt have helped
its gettin cold better bring your ski clothes
peekin through the keyhole the door locked by myself
and im feelin it right now
cause its the time when my heart got shot down
blocka blocka blocka blocka blocka
pour a little champagne cranberry vodka

my mama was raised in the era when

hit the freeway and see how fast the aston go
roll the window down clip off the ashes so
you can see all my diamonds and how much cash i blow
how many bitches i fuck how many cars i drive
how many goons i got count em and they all outside
niggas try to shut me up like malcom
but standin in the window k smokin was the outcome
sometimes i get a little stressed and pop a valium
hit hollywood late night and knock down a stallion
so niggas think twice bout my medallion or
youll hear cuba gooding yelling ricky
my nostalgia is a hunnid percent compton zero percent snitch
park a bentley and the phantom on blocks where i used to pitch
made the cincinnati fitted more famous than griffey did
and just to think several years ago they tried to split his wig
two to the chest struck his heart one hit his rib
then i blacked out like a movie all i could hear

feelin all fucked up woke up to a doctor
all i could think about was if the cops took my weed and my choppers
they want me to sing like sinatra
i told the detective get this clear like belvedere vodka
them five that shots then created a monster
hells kitchen comin straight out of compton
i seen boyz n the hood morris chestnut was a actor
twopac was the real life ricky
then they shot down the nigga that shot him swear to god
if im lying then compton is new york and im rakim
im from where niggas get murdered over stock rims
and punched in the jaw just for a cocked brim
nobody mama let the cops in we aint got no options
wanted to be a boxer but i was boxed in
then my grandmother house went up for auction
and thats what what killed her im goin back to buy the block then
too many niggas locked in dig up cochran and defend all my niggas
with they face under stockings rather face god than twentyfive with no options
if compton aint the murder capital we in the top ten
drive by with our face painted like a clown
with a tre pound forty shells bouncin off the ground
this how my living room sound when my brother got shot down


in compton you either a blood or a crip
nigga aint no one in between
shit was a hard decision for him to make cause both his parents was crips
his uncle greg was a crip he died when he was five
his brother jevon was a crip he got murdered when he was just thirteen
after that he decided that being a crip just wasnt for him
so he ran across the tracks until everything turned red
and never looked back


one point zero

wolf grey jordans use his intestines for the strings

im shooting a premature dream in the napkin
battling the evils in the flesh that im wrapped in
waiting for my eagle but the seagulls are distracting

and i know you remember that time when he was five
all these tours taking the toll i can see it in his eyes
so i stopped tours stopped rapping didnt give a fuck about
nothing that happened after recording the doctors advocate
catching up with my son cause aint nothing more important

helping him with his jumper the day he turned nine
i asked him what he want for his birthday he said to spend some time
so we kick it thats my best friend i dont have to get married

every part of the whole world theres an area
that if youre poor another day alive is a miracle
the blocks in watts got crooked cops that frame the innocent
no different from flint michigan
living in the d checking in with the pimps and them
its similar to o town in the southern peninsula
pretty city skyscrapers will fool you look through to
inner cities the rich wont move to
the nice parts they well protected by a vanguard
the opposite of how these concentration camps are
low income housing it dwells murderers
but children dont qualify for health services
the bourgeois act like they dont see starvations
like they spraying estée lauder on sanitation

streetlights come on cop cars lights flicker
they smoke us like cigarettes need a light nigga
used to chastise or string us up to spite niggas
war to fight for the culture instead we eaten by vultures
they mix us like mimosas hang us on wanted posters
asked for license and registration with they gun out the holster
some of us guilty some of us not some of us filthy rich
others just watch us niggas drive up the block
we think we keeping it one hundred coming back to the hood
they think we flossin money so they pull a ratchet whats good
it happens in compton happens in queens happened to big l
happened to chinx and twopac in that passengers seat
sometimes its internal happens to you before you happen to bleed
whats beef cops killing niggas dead in the streets
so before we look outside we gotta look within
cause now we the dinosaurs i think the world bout to end

im from the project buildings high stories
my stories from violence to glory
dog eat dog world gory
in the gutter brother despise brother
throwing threats at each other
broken bottles and bar fights with box cutters
alcoholics narcotics organized
families sleep from a gas stove burned alive
they bagging up drugs with plastic gloves
on his way to the top with his cash he shrugs
kidnappers degenerate thieves and gamblers
stealing panhandlers wrapping grams up
rubber bands on they grams what
playing cards and they bored
members of gangs living by and dying by the sword
block parties fools stamp debit cards
your hood aint no different from ours
we share the same dreams same money
same clothes and cars instead we get the same jail bars

me and gods son jumping out of project buildings in black parachutes
both classic both ride through the hood in a pair of coupes
flow sick mix the henny with the theraflu
he told me i was ill at that houstons nigga where was you
hip hop critics sit the fuck down get a chair or two
i aint tryna kick knowledge just a pair of graphic parables

sub woofers in the trunk kickin that lethal injection

at the intersection waitin on the rival
cause in the city of angels its all about survival
fuck the five point zero they wanna see you doa
welcome to la
where the ghetto birds flyin over my aunties and my cousins house
tell me what they buzzin bout
the little homie got smoked on the corner
and now his momma cryin dead in califronia

jumped in my impala took a trip to the swap meet
to scoop up ego trippin and some white ts
cause some niggas in my old hood dont like me
time to put the niggas on check like my nikes
shoulda heard my my nigga mack ten on the chirp
all i need is me and my bitch if you scared go to church
cause in califorinia niggas crack heads for the turf
and life aint nothin but tec nines and dirt
dippin through the the jungles my escalade hit a dip
fuck here come the gorillas in the mist
and they dressed like ice cube was in ninetysix
stone cold jheri curls and not one drip
i sleep with the worms fore i swim with the fish
and i ride with my niggas fore i roll witta bitch
if it dont make dollars it dont make sense
and i almost got shot cause i hit a fence

call the us government and tell em its a motherfuckin code red
niggas tried to straight up jack me now they both dead
third little nigga got away on his moped
caught him round the corner put the beam on his forehead
jumped in the impala then smashed through the light
without a one time in sight
so i bust a right on century headed to the lax
where there aint nothin but fly bitches and jets
in and out of lanes and i almost wrecked
off brand nigga in the six point zero throwin up his set
he must dont know i got the forty on deck
and the tec tryna be shabba ranks time to flex
its the third this shit happened to me all day
guess its time to add another dead body to the throw away
so i turned down my spice one tape
and hit the switch emptied the whole clip in his fuckin face


yo im hopping out a phantom with a iced out medallion
stallions on both arms rocks on both charms
my dominican chick looking like scarface sister

like the first time you heard mary j and you were standing in line
to purchase tickets to see her blow like chicago wind
and im ridin with common looking for chicago zen
and like chicago winds i was once a street disciple
rockin every jordan shoe nike put out by michael
that made me feel like i could fly sometimes i wanted to die
prolly cause the angel dust was fuckin with my third eye
so i start hip hop and i understand why common used to love her
she got me open so i even had to fuck her
but i used the rubber cause she was married to rakim
so i bought me a gold chain pretendin that i was him
so i can get close to the girl i loved the most
but she left cali and went on tour with ne yo and ghost
big gave her one more chance and she took big down
i shouldve knew when shock g and pac told me she get around

all these tours taking the toll i can see it in his eyes
so i stopped tours stopped rapping didnt give a fuck about
nothing that happened after recording the doctors advocate

helping him with his jumper the day he turned nine
i asked him what he want for his birthday he said to spend some time
so we kick it thats my best friend i dont have to get married

every part of the whole world theres an area
that if youre poor another day alive is a miracle
the blocks in watts got crooked cops that frame the innocent
no different from flint michigan
living in the d checking in with the pimps and them
its similar to o town in the southern peninsula
pretty city skyscrapers will fool you look through to
inner cities the rich wont move to
the nice parts they well protected by a vanguard
the opposite of how these concentration camps are
low income housing it dwells murderers
but children dont qualify for health services
the bourgeois act like they dont see starvations
like they spraying estée lauder on sanitation

streetlights come on cop cars lights flicker
they smoke us like cigarettes need a light nigga
used to chastise or string us up to spite niggas
war to fight for the culture instead we eaten by vultures
they mix us like mimosas hang us on wanted posters
asked for license and registration with they gun out the holster
some of us guilty some of us not some of us filthy rich
others just watch us niggas drive up the block
we think we keeping it one hundred coming back to the hood
they think we flossin money so they pull a ratchet whats good
it happens in compton happens in queens happened to big l
happened to chinx and twopac in that passengers seat
sometimes its internal happens to you before you happen to bleed
whats beef cops killing niggas dead in the streets
so before we look outside we gotta look within
cause now we the dinosaurs i think the world bout to end

im from the project buildings high stories
my stories from violence to glory
dog eat dog world gory
in the gutter brother despise brother
throwing threats at each other
broken bottles and bar fights with box cutters
alcoholics narcotics organized
families sleep from a gas stove burned alive
they bagging up drugs with plastic gloves
on his way to the top with his cash he shrugs
kidnappers degenerate thieves and gamblers
stealing panhandlers wrapping grams up
rubber bands on they grams what
playing cards and they bored
members of gangs living by and dying by the sword
block parties fools stamp debit cards
your hood aint no different from ours
we share the same dreams same money
same clothes and cars instead we get the same jail bars

me and gods son jumping out of project buildings in black parachutes
both classic both ride through the hood in a pair of coupes
flow sick mix the henny with the theraflu
he told me i was ill at that houstons nigga where was you
hip hop critics sit the fuck down get a chair or two
i aint tryna kick knowledge just a pair of graphic parables

thinking back to that beamer wish my nigga pac was strapped
but im dreaming las vegas boulevard afenis sons bullet scars
everybody king of diamonds until the feds pull they cards
not the deck though
hip hop was better off when it was just dre scarface and esco
memoirs of the gold chain
its a cold game nigga johnny coltrane
black versaces with the gold frame
nigga said he sold caine thats a bold claim
fourteen had a brain that could throw flames
so strange have to blow they mind cobain

thats the crack music nigga
im not an army im a movement
the flow is water andre tried to ice cube him
ice cubin roof translucent
chick on my side tryna get my trues loose
when im talkin bout god she posed to bow her head
now she all on the blog steady postin bout her head
got me thinking like a father is the world safe
got me clinging to my daughter like shark fins in water
rocks in my ears sunk the titanic
this is my life and its exactly how i planned it damn it
god says everything happens for a reason
i seen four seasons at the four seasons
take that chinchilla off poor kids is freezing
cookin up in the same pot they aint got to pee in

pieces on gold leashes
cruisers around greases make them cohesive
im the sun shining with god features
draw closer to a true blood bleeder soul of a southern preacher
went from dinner with bottom feeders to world leaders
we throw the peace up knowing that the world need us
eagerness to live life and see the bright lights
to sacrifices we made its sorta christ like
at the after party thinking what the afterlifes like
he paid for our sins is it really priced right
fuck it i see the light broads they see the light
cant deny my jesus piece thats so peter like
chicks crow for dough get low for mo
a convo piece she end up at the condo
another jane doe or a golden angel
pendant on an angle watch the chain glow

for one person who cares
so put one hand in the air

it used to be id get afraid and id drive
going forwards always been the only place i can hide
with no direction i would speed a hundred miles down the coast
until i lose the ghost thats chasing me but never arrive
i know the nights scary but were alive and the pipes cherry
and ive got a stack of papers like a library
im driving seeking a beacon of light freakishly
all i needed was a speaker that might speak to me
but my cd system is so janky a cone dangles
and it dances on its chord like its bo jangles
you can work it if you hold it at a low angle
but when the bass hits it grows tangled
come on right speaker ill take everything you give me
but dont pity me theres people living on a single kidney
in my shitty car im living large and mashing through my city
sitting pretty i know
that im ready to go


for beautiful babies in vegas on their last chip
for all my ninth life kittens hittin catnip
for heavy drinkers thinking they were never jack shit
youre thinking thats it but hit a backflip
you got a cracked rib or maybe a bad liver
you got a bad hip or even a bad temper
but if its last supper one legged mad leper
put on that glass slipper you aint no half stepper
this aint no last breath its only one collapsed lung
were holding up the bank with nothing but a cap gun
down to your last blank
down to my last drop
up in the gas tank
we better have fun
time isnt a sacred cow
and im willing to take it down to the final minute or second milking my last one
going up for a take and im itching for action
all i need is one
i should remind myself that


theres seven billion fortysix million people on the planet
and most of us have the audacity to think we matter
hey you hear the one about the comedian who croaked
someone stabbed him in the heart just a little poke
but he keeled over cause he went into battle wearing chain mail made of jokes
hey you hear the one about the screenwriter who passed away
he was giving elevator pitches and the elevator got stuck halfway
he ended up eating smushed sandwiches they pushed through a crack in the door
and repeating the same crappy screenplay idea about talking dogs til his last day
hey you hear the one about the fisherman who passed
he didnt jump off that ledge
he just stepped out into the air and pulled the ground up towards him really fast
like he was pitching a line and went fishing for concrete
the earth is a drum and hes hitting it on beat
the reason theres smog in los angeles is cause if we could see the stars
and we could see how small each one of us is
against the vastness of what we dont know
no one would ever audition for a mcdonalds commercial again
and then where would we be
no frozen dinners and no tv
and is that a world we want to text in
either someone just microwaved popcorn
or i hear the sound of a thousand people pulling their heads out of their asses in rapid succession
the people are hunched over in boston
theyre starting app stores and screen printing companies in san francisco


i write till my fingers look like a bouquet of roses
you gotta bring yourself your flowers now in show biz
focus its quiet coyote come on lets go kids
everybody get together with a study buddy
and then talk about the fucks that i dont give
because its so big and explosive
but a lotta people dont live they dont ever get a motive
if you got a goal you gotta hold onto what hope is
if i didnt have it i would ask you where the rope is
work is my church and so the studios the closest
i spit it sick until my cootie flows the grossest
dont be so pissed just be focused on your own shit
cause we supercalifornialisticsexyandweknowsit
youre not my menace i go for number one not a top five finish
you can have a chicken pot pie
but im thinking that im gonna have another can of popeyes spinach
im a rottweiler pop my collar when i pop my fur
youre on my nerves mark my words
gotta put a leg up and then mark my turf

work until im black and yellow black and yellow worker bee
i just work until im black and blue and burgundy
burgundy work until i earn that rich mahogany
honestly cant you tell im working bitch dont bother me
show some modesty if youre watching me
a bitch is anybody in my way its not misogyny
but if youre blockin me i will soon defeat you


fuck you if you love a car for its paint job
love you if you love a car for the road trips
show me the miles and your arms and the pink scar
where the doctor had to pull out all the bone chips
cause you were pressing on the gas just a bit hard
right in the moment where the road curved a bit sharp
and when you woke up
somebody was unclipping your seat belt
and pulling you from the open window of your flipped car

show me someone who says they got no baggage
ill show you somebody whose got no story
nothing gory means no glory but baby please dont bore me
we wont know until we get there
the who or the what or the when where
my favorite sweater was a present that i got a couple presidents ago
and i promised that i would rock it till its thread bare
bet on it
every single person gotta couple skeletons
so pretty soon in this room
itll just be me and you when we clear out all the elephants
me and you and the elements
we all have our pitfalls
beers flat the cabs have been called
and everybody and their momma can hear the drama thats happening behind these thin walls

my pattern with women isnt a flattering image
but i dont want to run away because i said so
i dont want to be the guy to hide all of my flaws
and ill be giving you the side of me that i dont let show
everything in fashion
that has ever happened
always coming crashing down
better let go
but in a couple years it will be retro
you rock marc ecko
my shirts have the gecko
cause in the past man i was hopeless
but nows when my little cousins look the dopest
fuck the fashion po po
have a stale doughnut i dont need no tips
fuck a five second rule
thats a plan i never understood
its september in my kitchen in a christmas sweater
sipping cold coffee on the phone with damaged goods


them rims them rings them things you can bring em out
i just had my debit card declined at in n out
the line is flipping out giving me evil eyes
fuck the soda re run it with just the cheesy fries
cause i dont think money is the devil
im not sinking im just kicking it at sea level
i got my floaties on
im focusing on all the wonderful stuff with the force of obi wan
kenobi bro im broke although i wont be woebegone
cause even though my bank account is low or overdrawn
im down to mow yer lawn
im getting open im soaking up every moment
and so we should make a toast we wont be sober till the broke of dawn
because beer is cheap
and because love is free
im buzzin feeling like every friend is a cousin g
and someday well be reminiscing on some wasnt we
just so down and out
but we were happy then cause

why should i sit on my ass on the couch and be asking why life isnt equal
with lesser possessions im light as a feather and so i can fly like an eagle
cause everyone dies and i wonder why leaders in power would lie to their people
be planning like they could be fitting a camel up into the eye of a needle
but dammit id settle for fitting a ninetyfour camry inside of my driveway
im sick of the image im living my life and im doing it my way
id rather be making the choices im proud of than chasing a mountain of money
but if that mountain comes to me im climbing it
got a brick and im laying it down


the first time i went back to homeroom from the hospital
i thought that being more embarrassed was impossible
but god the second time it really turned my stomach
now im the kid who collapses and then spazzes out in public
this time was a bowling alley the first was in the yard
and kids in middle school just watched me trip and kicked me hard
except this girl named crissie li who flips around at her desk
and gives me the worlds biggest disney card
wrote best wishes and kisses where she signed it
three feet by two feet i coulda hid behind it
i didnt like the pity from christina li though
im thinking crissie cant you see im busy being emo
cause i think i mighta heard she maybe sorta liked me
and since she wasnt cool enough i guess i took it lightly
had braces and glasses and wasnt mrs popular
and so i didnt really give a thought to her

theres holes in my memory  it isnt photographic
theres holes in my yearbook but the cut out folks were plastic
ten years pass i dont cross paths
with half the people from my class again til we meet at crissies open casket
those who chose to ask it probably knew
i could have dug in deeper if id wanted to
but you couldnt tell a thing was off on the surface
and i didnt know she was sick until i heard about her service
she was born with a heart defect used to the cold knife
shed been in and out of hospitals her whole life
she knew the whole time and never said why
she felt my pain herself and helped me hold my head high
the nicest folks are those who know the throes of crisis
though i know its crime to twist her life to fit my own devices
whys it so hard to mourn and then try to learn by this
but lights that burn shortest
are the lights that burn brightest

our eightth grade yearbook page for dedicating songs wasnt long
even in a school eleven hundred strong
the yearbook advertised for months but when its said and done
crissie bought six the third most of anyone
alvin got your faith in me by jessica simpson
pebbles got richard marxs ballad at the beginning
it feels like sloppy poetry the way her life would end
after sending mariah carreys any time you need a friend
but corniness is honesty thats wrapped in cliché
and most slow jam lyrics arent shit im brave enough to say without a smirk
but before she went to dirt she left us finally
i will remember you to geoff mike bry and me
you can plot if you must
say its obviously fate or explain that god is just
but all i know is that until my bodys dust
i will try to think of her as much as crissie thought of us


got the power of my will
i dont wanna win a mil
but im looking at the window sill
gotta take a bitter pill
gonna pay for what i did to my head and my heartll foot the bill
got a foot in my mouth and because im kicking myself i developed a habit of knocking out my front tooth
looking uncouth
want to hear the truth
give it to me straight
one point one proof
telling myself itll happen when im happy but im climbing up a ladder that has got no end
hung up on a rung ill never make it to the top im looking at the bottom and i must descend
all i want to do is buck this trend
everybody need a buck to spend
and ill be working on myself til i work on someone else til i get there ima just pretend

when im in a crisis
in a moment of silence
i look under my eyelids
and im checking my mileage
i been using a pool of water as a mirror but not for style its
so i can reach in and pimpslap my reflection for acting childish
spent a half an hour
sitting at the bottom of my shower
letting the water run over my body and  but i didnt have the power
i dont have the answer anyway yay
dont want to panic but i got to come clean
because the plan of the planet is just mean
knew it was tough but dammit its obscene
i been huffing and puffing up to the top of the summit and imma rough it if i have enough steam
ill keep on coming and coming until im coming with the stamina of a salmon whos heading upstream


once upon a time in a remote tasmanian trailer park
there was born a baby boy by the name of nedson willbry
one day when nedson was a baby his crackhead teen mum
got real distracted watching teen mum on the telly and dropped ned right on his noggin
leaving a bump on the top of his head
the little bean stopped squirming
and his mum thought he was surely done for
so mommy brought the tiny bundle to the forest during a terrible storm
and left him for dead in a field of pumpkins and wolves

just then lighting struck
and a cry cut through the night light like a siren on a fire truck
ned survived by the slightest luck he wasnt a dead baby neddy was alive as fuck
it was a miracle were hearing
the creatures of the evening came creeping to the clearing
to see this little man nugget
soon to be immortalized in poetry just like the man from nantucket
but as the little babe was grown
they gave to him their home
and raised him as their own
he roamed and trapezed from the tallest trees
he got his steez from the wallabies
they all loved him
but the tasmanian devils loved little neddy more than all of em
they taught him how to spin like a fan
til ned spun himself into a fine young man
but one day like a sick disease
loggers crept in and chopped the eucalyptus trees
they smushed the cuddly forest creatures
and turned em into body wash and sneakers
but ned escaped and yelled angrily
that you abandoned me
you killed my family
but god dammit i cant use your pity
and he snuck onto a ship bound for new york city

neds voyage led him to the deepest darkest dankest bowels of that ship
he met all kinds of seedy characters on that voyage like old japanese men and their wives
he had delicious meals of fresh cut sashimi pumpkin pie
and all kinds of delicious breads and cookies and cakes
when he was on that voyage he knew what lied ahead
so he kept his sights set on new york city
and before he knew it he arrived

ned almost drowned
he kissed the ground
but his guts were churned up in this town
where down was up and up was down
so the boy from down under flipped right around
ned did a cartwheel and stopped halfway
and he walked on his palms from that day
but city folk treated ned like a freak
that hand walking lump headed yeti cant speak
one night walking home ned was quite shocked
he saw a b boy spinning on the sidewalk
he couldnt stop wouldnt stop
staring at those limbs spinning like a wooden top
sweeter than a puddin pop ned was home at last
and every night hed watch em dance through the glass
of the club and hed wait there in line for his chance
but the bouncer said freak you cant dance

oh but ned sweet little ned he wouldnt get out of line
and the bouncer pushed him and pushed him
but to catch his balance ned hardheaded upside down ned did what ned did best
he just spun and he spun and he spun and he spun
everyone in the club came out to watch what is now regarded
as the greatest fucking head spin of all time
legend has it that neds still out there on bleecker street
spinning on the curb to this very day


im getting hummus hummus
im at the park playing dodgeball
drinking san pellegrino like its cristal
no school alcohol
living no rules calvinball
you wanna brawl ho please
i sprinkle you with some goat cheese
i get it straight from the fuckin farm
i even put goat cheese in my lucky charms
im at the taco truck looking like a mack
i roll my rs hard like im busting off a gat
its like hola mama im your papa
may i please have dos horrchatas
im like brap brap brap
when i smack your ass fast with my backpack strap

pencil to the neck razor to your innertube
bullet to your disrespect i hate your hipster attitude
your whole chassez acting like you own us with your whole passé
dance around the issue patna no plié
but youll get broke for that french shit so cassé
and you can put that in your lit mag and your tumblr blog
eat it with the bacon off your farm fresh hog
sip it like kombucha hope your last meal suit ya
do gooder types commuters on bikes
brooding twenty somethings with the coolest of likes
you be loving on my city like johns
rubbing on her titties leaving money in palms
our rumbling guts can only hunger so much
plus we redundantly blunted in lieu of giving a fuck
well cut you for the scratch
leave in on a tee
and if weve done it properly youre copping it from treat cause

look in the mirror and its clear ive become one of em
kill me please if im one of em
i walk the block like im hot shit
i gentrified the corner store just buying hot chips
but now im caught red handed
with this land so make me a dead bandit
and if you see me sipping at an open keg
put me down like a horse with a broken leg


if stars died of old age
they wouldnt explode theyd burn out with a slow fade
but stars escape life with a gun shot
which makes me think they stick a pistol in their sun spot
bite the barrel squeeze the trigger
might have cared once but the obstacles seem bigger
and theyre stuck behind a giant eight ball
the milky way is star brains that are smeared across the space wall
you know the red giant in sector two
yeah hector true he was a depressing dude
i think he thought nobody thought about him
and now that i think about it im liable to guess its true
everybody wants the sun to come and cure their rough moods but suns need love too
i give out energy and dont receive im tired now ill go to sleep
and when this is the coldest solstice maybe folksll notice me

goodbye maggie goodbye jules
i wish youd stuck around you wise fools
cause friends they tend to come and go
the way the ocean ebbs and flows but theres reminders in the tide pools
but when the standing waters putrid
who am i to say a choice you made was stupid
theres a bunch of us who loved you
fucking stuck here pointing fingers at ourselves for something you did
you you you you you packed your problems in a suitcase
you you you went away forever to a new place
you left behind a lot of blue faces and bouquets and loose ends like shoelaces
but my friend its too late
so all my lightweights and barflies lets raise a pint each time a star dies
and toast the memory of hard lives
filed on the interstellar hard drives and archives


ive seen a person go to shows and raise a lighter app
but if youre at my concert please dont ever try that crap
lets set fire to the heavens
turn the motherfucking speakers to eleven this is spinal tap
the future might defeat me the internet can eat me
it really tastes like chicken when i bite the hand that feeds me
and i say me me me me play my cd cd
yes indeedy deedy
we be greedy and its tragic that we yawn
we got every gadget but dont care theres magic in our palm
cause its been getting so hot i can feel the slow rot
but lets not die before we get to fuck a robot
because we all need something to live for something to live for something to live for
we all need something to live for something to live for

there was a time before the pot really got strong
before the hippies got jobs talking long long
before the people talked in english out in hong kong
before the holy dalai lama had a dot com
before gods dad got it on with gods mom
before he made us pretty things on which to drop bombs
before the war crimes
the rich and poor times
im talking in the land before the land before time
but then the planet lost its baby fat and got crazy
and weve been acting like some fraidycats a lot lately
somethingll kill us like cigarettes or the commies maybe
or maybe aids or scabies rabies or zombie babies
even the kgb pray we be free from add wade in and bathe in hades
no army or navys saving me
and i cant tell our little victories from epic fails
its either heaven or hell and i cant make heads or tails


its hard to be living
you gotta play the cards you were given
you think its simple but it goddamn isnt
and fuck it its embedded in your dna


because if we dont build it who will
i do things on a shoestring that you couldnt do for a cool mil
i run with no laces and when i fall i start
to build my taj mahal with shit i found at dollar mart
this lifes our greatest project
the journeys all an art
but i built my perfect nest and its bout to fall apart
again and again and then i just i make it twice as high
and i give my tower teeth and i watch it bite the sky
because i might just cry if i dont keep it moving
i focus on what i can make and not what just got ruined
cause every stone will crumble down to dust to dust to dust
and i say love thy neighbor and i say fuck thy hater
theres nothing i cant solve with duct tape and construction paper
i dont want a band aid ill only rip it off ill rip it off

i know someday ill pass and maybe then rest
im laying on my back
heavens my bench press
cause my imagination is crazy as glenn beck
a cloud is floating by in the shape of a rent check
and when the world ends thats what ill plan towards
then ill trust girlfriends and maybe landlords
cause i been played but im looking for more
i say what would i gain if i took it to court
cause if people were perfect then there wouldnt be war
we stay pushing but once we get a foot in the door
we get our toes chopped off and a foot of manure
i still gotta believe people
are good at the core
cause if we werent whats at stake


ill be feeling a hella of a lot of swell
and from the second that i step in ill be smelling like a big cheese
everybody better be ready to get it get it
cause im getting nekkid if you really want a strip tease
and the babies in their highchairs taking off their bibs
and their mommies all be ripping out their wig weaves
and the pretty people in the oil paintings on the wall
are popping molly and theyre stripping off their fig leaves
better burn your clothes
itll curl your toes
kissing women and they turn to toads
im pimping kermits hoes
and im sure that every girl is a pearl and the world is a perfect globe
but when im joking with my little cousin
and he pulls my finger then the motherfuckin earth explodes
boom

everybody been in it to win it kickin in for a minute
and chilling but youre tardy its why i gotta kill it
and then hit the pretty people in the building with my party trick
i think im gonna walk out of the door
hop in my delorean and im gonna soar
cept that its a subaru and im yelling hoodie hoo
hanging out the window like im marty mcfly
a lot of the chickens in the flock wanna squawk and they get obnoxious
and all i hear is bawk bawk
and im not gonna wanna talk shop
better put a sock in it if you gotta cock block
and be toxic and knock us and all we wanna do is rock rock and be raucous
im not gonna ever stop if you think im chopped liver in the crock pot
cause i am a boss hog and i want the top spot and i got this


yeah you see them craters
that was cause a kid said thered be none greater
in ten years hammering hank was at the plate launching balls into space saying see ya later
skinny as a toothpick but he got a knack
watch him swing a broomstick at a bottlecap
watch him rinse and repeat till hes on the map
going from the cheap seats to the autographs
papa put a bat in my hand and all he said was never ever ever ever rock a dodger hat
and whether you win or you didnt you gotta be getting dirty
and we better send your jersey to the laundromat
it was in the cards
i knew someday id be a big league star
playing second base for the giants wearing number nine rocking knee high socks
if i just worked hard

we had our sixth grade baseball tryouts on the basketball courts
so a fastballhad hops
we didnt have a grass field and so coach hit us grounders
off the asphalti dropped
a lot and so he hit em faster and i took em off my ankles
yelling thats all you got
and when i saw my name on the roster i went insane
like i was sniffing bath salts im nothere to play soft
ill go beastmode on a piñata and bite its motherfucking face off
until it rains candy out of its neck hole
i dont go flexing my pecs or get swole
i wasnt the fastest
and when i moved it kinda looked like i was running through molassestrue
its silly to give a shit about a game but earth
is a little ball thats spinning on its axistoo

i wasnt cut out for the bigs guess i been a fool
and middle school was just a bit of cruel ridicule
but when you step into the ranks of the man
its like they push you from the high dive to the kiddie pool
its time to ballroom waltz that plank
were little minnows in a small shark tank
you try to swim without getting blood in the water
but youre all heart and guts like a ballpark frank
never an all star
i had to keep score
if i were perfect i would quit and join the peace corps
im not a hero if i didnt try my doubts eat at me
like im a carcass on the sea floor
so say this shit is too corny
it tastes better to me than ooh poor me
im just trying to sing a different tune
and then fit into a world that didnt have room for me


hello hello hello hello
its a motherfuckin pleasure
no pressure but would you like to blow my mind
and move too fast and plan our perfect lives together
holy holy holy holy  you mean to tell me tell me tell 
youre tough to love when you dont love yourself well

my less exciting features are packed inside my body
theyre crammed into the balcony theyre jamming up the lobby
theyre falling out the window
you can see them crashing through the glass
when i dont keep my lids closed as the director flicks his wrist
the stagehand in the wing has got a silver chain he grips it
when he lifts it opens up the velvet curtains of my lips
and i say

were not looking to wish on a star
were no good at receiving the help
who the hell do you think that you are
tryna make me believe in myself
youre like the sun in the summertime
i know you are but what am i
i dont really wanna sound like a lullaby
but i think every family is a butterfly
you know pretty from afar pretty gross up close
dont pity what we are its mostly unhideous
and im sitting at the bar with a beer
so cheers come toast me
get cozy since were both lonely
why dont we leap and then go see
what we become when its done its done
but im not looking below so dont ghost me
and its seeming like were in agreement
that the demon that were fighting isnt the exact same
but if were teaming up and carrying the weight together
we can miss a bit of back pain
and if youre into it then we can get up out the city
in a minute in the fast lane
get hitched in a chapel in vegas
maybe get rich life is a craps game
and i take my cue from you
on what you wanna do bout a last name
its not so bad to be a watsky

those fires in your attic that rage without permission


you dont know the name of like half of these folks
and theyll be sprinting for the exit the minute youre broke
a bunch of bobblehead muppets to laugh at your jokes
wipe your ass and come and give your ego a stroke
i know you know its way too late now and your soul is dark
yeah motherfucker i see through you to your midnight heart

its tough to care about stupid bullshit all of the time
so i gotta say im glad thats your job and not mine
everybodys got a topic at the top of their mind
a choice of how you wanna let your life be defined
sleeping around is your taste
are you the paper you chase
you said that ive been playing it safe
if you got the bravest voice say that to my face
pretty shitty to hear
but i took a difficult look in the mirror and i checked in the rearview
objects are never what they appear
the past tends to look crooked from here
the maskthat i put on out of fear the tracks that i didnt put out
the facts that i kept out of my ear
the slack that i cut people who didnt deserve it is tragically clear
no no no not this year
im not done changing yet
ill get these old knees checked
i cant bend over for someone i dont respect


ill be gone when you read this so i just wanted to say
im sorry to the couple decent people who got in the way
and maybe there was a point at which this all could have been different
but this is the position were in and its pointless to wish that it isnt
theyll all be gawking when i walk in the door
cocking my shotgun hammer and they drop to the floor
the clocks shatter i scatter the jock horde and splatter the chalkboard
it matters a lot more than half of you thought
when you were knocking me like im a laughingstock
and a weakling a freak and creep i was mocked and ignored
youre sorry now but talk is cheap   shoulda thought it before
youre the sorry flock of sheep who made me rot to the core
thanks for tuning into the top rated crew in the news
feels great to us that were the one that viewers would choose
im hearing through my producer
weve got the scoop on the name and the favorite food of the shooter
plus an interview with a student
whos been fed through a tube she was shot in the head
were gonna bring you a segment live from her hospital bed
well try to bring you the spin through your preexisting opinions
but if we miss it switch it to our sister network instead
of course we know this situation is tragic
but take a minute to appreciate our fabulous graphics
and well be back in action with up to the second reports
after a couple of words from all our loyal sponsors of course
so like us vine us and tweet to connect
twentyfour point seven were giving ya what youre craving
we live to deliver live the kinda coverage youve come to expect
were always here for you

we come together in this hour of need
to the honor the innocent victims of this cowardly deed
of course i share your sentiment as your voice in the senate
but lets accept nothing ever could have been done to prevent it
its just the strange inner visions of a deranged individual
full of rage full of hate full of vitriol
but i gotta mention that its sick and insane
my opponents twisting your pain for political gain
thats lame
and i think its a damn shame
it doesnt give anyone power to cast blame
because the past is past and its best that we keep things the same
so my chads and my staceys go back to the mall
fill your bags out at macys and chat in the hall
and i hope im the vote that you cast in the fall
cause i care for you its true


the drum is never the enemy of the pen
but when im meeting mentally with beat and melody then
one of me can turn into ten of me
if theres ten of me tell me how many heavenly similes can we blend
like women and men would fall with no friends
like a rose would fall with no stem
like most folks follow trends
like os follow lmns
thats how well i know life flows with the elements
as sunrise kills an evening
as stars die and a night sky is grieving
as man sees what he has when its leaving
you gone is as asthma to breathing
thats how much i need you in my life
im never gonna ever leave you in my lifetime
cause every time i hear line that shows me im not alone its saving me
cause i know that thats a lifeline
like mindsthis is our home and they wont ruin it easily
cause the wolf is gonna blow until hes blue in the cheek
and me and you and the crew can go take a snooze in the street
and the bulldozer can come chew on our feet
we never let em through
well build a levy
limit the rivers level
steady the flood and begin with a pebble
lend me one syllable
come if youre ready to shovel
run if youre shaking
but i know that today is not my waterloo

every day the planets losing iq points
but people still bumping ice cube joints
so ive got hope
and every day im seeking my true voice and looking up at a bright new choice
cause everybodys got a hustle and everyones trying to push it
its tricky to find the kush hiking up a mountain of bullshit
and theres another mountain of bullshit next to it littered with glitter money
and strippers theyre selling as good shit
its nothing new up at the core though
everything same as its always been only more so
of course so same token while theres life there is truth
so if youre blocking the future i wanna to walk toward
suit yourself were gonna lock swords
but its a wash if youre saying watsky i could rock withcha if you didnt talk
like some nails on a chalkboard
i can tellthat youre really on your dope writer tip
but youll trip if you dont try to fit
maybe you can make it if you ghostwrite a hit
and sell it to somebody who can ghostride a whip
shieeti say no sirree
i can smell the weak shit through the potpourri
so im just gonna do what i do
you take a minute or two and google tim and magoo
i love the life that i picked even if it aint plush
im too glad to complain much
im in the lab in a drab world
while these fuckers dab and do dabs and i dab on my pad with my paintbrush
this is for the kids whipping up some home cooked


air salad
sex vinaigrette
intravenous internet
jazz cigarettes
blasé frenzy
officer friendly
venti trapaccino
gluten free henny
crocodile skin in the bentley
graveyard shift at the dennys
north side plenty south side pennies
i vote yeezus  deez nuts two point twenty
you want to run a country that makes me shiver
bitch i wouldnt trust you to run with adult scissors
flushed ass face flash that cash
your fleshlight wouldnt let you smash
collection plate passing through the church benches
pastors pull up to their chapels in benzes
i guess that i musta missed class that day
its so senseless baby please pass that j

cant bear a bear market with a bare body
rich heirhot air choking errbody
they swore youd soar check your sore body
see the sweat pour from each pore of your poor body
someone wise once wrote
our worlds divided into two types of folk
now theres the type of people who divide the world into different types of people
and then theres the type who dont
my uniters crack a beer on the couch
if were not eye to eye im hearing you out
and my dividers get your center part ready
cause ill divide your skull with a dull machete

fetch or rollover
no way its the cold shoulder
for machiavellian martin skhrelian suit and tie soldiers

uh oh uh oh

my mind it used to be sharper than cutco
somebody came at me cutthroat
broke open my dome and grafittid inside on the stucco

beethoven lovers or juggalos chugging a faygo

yes ive been a mess
with the pressure the stress
see ya never i guess
nevertheless finding you i was blessed
swear im trying my best
lion inside of my chest
trying to claw his way out
crack my ribs pop my lungs
i dont know if theres a safe route
nowwe can cut this frayed rope
or hope and wait us to fade
babe after how great the ups were
we cant be living with love when its lost its luster
frosted over busted exhausted ruptured
another couple who settled for less
we want something real
a relationship
wanna feel
and quit chasing shit
gimme a shield
all were seekins a person that we can cherish
i dont think you really want a green card marriage
nothing is fair but youre caring and cant bear it
a lot of people perished tonight in paris
the planet is a mean is a motherfucker
you wanna scream but we gotta lean on each other
we suffer and pick ourselves up off of the floor
your dad at stage four what could i say to support
can we just quit each other
the way you did cigarettes
up and split cold turkey no regrets
id even miss tasting the nicotine on your breath when we kiss
im not ready to say good bye to you yet
like sayonara
i dont know if i can try tomorrow
am i supposed to say a hallelujah
smile i knew ya
and go on my way


easy with a ballot we can put a reality tv personality in dc
speak free if you can see how this delicate fucking matter developed but man it beats me
two fleets keep peace on the mean streets
one treats brown people like theyre beastly
nothing like the force that police me
whats the fate of the species
get a metal plate and then mate with the pcs
or retreat back to a monkey chucking feces
wanna ease this pain
different than the bc years
now we bcc jesus on the email chain
way too many threats to flee
way too many heads to feed
not too many beds to sleep
chief said that it was best you leave
f you please to the refugees
and its seeming like its every other day that i been tugging at my collar thinking damn its toasty
where did all the people at the supermarket go
that used to scan my groceries vanished mostly
and wassup with all the homies with the camo and the ammo in the rifles on their shoulder
walking through the city thinking that theyre annie oakley
thats quite enough
but this shit is fucking unbelievable
i swear you couldnt write this stuff

young george jetson stepping up in this motherfucker
gripping a butcher knife hoping i can cut the chord
where the horde is plugged to the motherboard
that is not a legitimate hoverboard
i iook at the sky saying my god run
lifes heavier than an ipod one
my twitter aint gonna matter when the tripods come
from the hieroglyphs to the crowded malls
never mind the if but the how it falls
im vibing out watching ow my balls
core defects tend to wreck my sleep
the quest to be more perfect than ford prefect
while im dreaming of electric sheep
cause soylent green is people resistance is just futile
pop a red pill and a blue pill and i dilate my pupils
moving light speed we all got vile needs
living is a violent deed
spread my soul like wild seed
why would it be any wonder i act weird
im trying to find out who the fuck i am
while looking in a cracked black mirror
you got a finish what you thought about
how this is gotta bottom out
you wanna flee the reaper but theyre bombing the city
and the single haven to creep in is the slaughterhouse


youre officially welcome to grab your crotches
synchronize your watches and pour us a couple scotches
people still as statues cant catch you turn pockets empty
if theyre packed with plenty move some to ones lacking any
while i take a crack at hacking the bank to jack em to cover high debts
youre screening floating bullets with a butterfly net if theres any screaming
pause it and cut out the sound deposit the slugs underground
im positive that we dont fuck around
no we go scooping up the diesel thats leaking a sinking tanker
forever stuck at anchor like beetles get stuck in amber
halted like the thaw of the iceberg that shoulda sank her
halted right beside the temperature spike and the spread of cancer
and all my peoples engagements and babies my friends are making
we quit getting lamer days quit getting later life quits being labor quick
you should come through to our party dude bring your crew bring an army
youth is inside of the heart the future can never harm me
were never tardy
late or early dont worry well wait cause were in no hurry to see those pearly gates
i sit outside and watch the pigeon shit and tiny airplanes hanging in the sky and then i
move this crowdto join as converts to the church of blessed concerts and then conjure up some conversation
yes im proudmy country is my heart and so in every combination we all rep a common nation
that is howi know that all we lepers and we shepherds join together now in holy congregation everybody
stop right now

some days i throw my hands up like this shit right here is hopeless
but today i throw my hands up like this shit right heres the dopest
ill never sew my familys holes up saying hocus pocus
so i focus love on what is whole and chase my magnum opus
theres so much more to life before i leave this skin behind me
right now im feeling finer than aaliyah in the ninetys
yeah today im feeling firmly like my faith could never burn me
like im apt to move that mountain just by glaring at it sternly
san francisco used to seem bigger than jupiter
how impossibly big it be  this symmetry
this brutality and beauty and synergy
and beyond what well live to see  i know nothing can limit me
just take everything ever and we are that times infinity


you dont know the name of like half of these folks
and theyll be sprinting for the exit the minute youre broke
a bunch of bobblehead muppets to laugh at your jokes
wipe your ass and come and give your ego a stroke
i know you know its way too late now and your soul is dark
yeah motherfucker i see through you to your midnight heart

its tough to care about stupid bullshit all of the time
so i gotta say im glad thats your job and not mine
everybodys got a topic at the top of their mind
a choice of how you wanna let your life be defined
sleeping around is your taste
are you the paper you chase
you said that ive been playing it safe
if you got the bravest voice say that to my face
pretty shitty to hear
but i took a difficult look in the mirror and i checked in the rearview
objects are never what they appear
the past tends to look crooked from here
the maskthat i put on out of fear the tracks that i didnt put out
the facts that i kept out of my ear
the slack that i cut people who didnt deserve it is tragically clear
no no no not this year
im not done changing yet
ill get these old knees checked
i cant bend over for someone i dont respect

wawawawawah
the familiar wa wa  walk of shame
glittering city of dreams
sex is on the breeze
must be springtime in the city


dont be nice

my policy is to call em as i see em no filler
quality people lift me up like the colosseum pillars


some go from pitching religion to sipping on kombucha
politicians switching positions like its the kama sutra


our narcissism has got us caught up like bars in prison
claim were winning gargling seven dicks and a jar of jizzum
your mommas a true beauty
butt makes me weep i call it a boo hooty
truly a hot mom
other moms are doing their squats wrong
and if you dont dig it when i spit it like an open spigot and im doing my duty
to drop bombs
visit wwkisswatskysgluteusmaximuscom
false modesty is a guilty habit
some people simply have it
but the fact is i would not have spent a decade doing this
if i did not believe i was at least tiny bit ridiculously filthy at it
wrote a book to branch out
after tour lets have a singalong and camp out
cause i came here for a single reason
and thats for friendship
and for drinking til i cant countnow
true i dont measure power by bravado libido
or by popping bottles with hefner in the grotto in speedos
im never sharing my moscato if you suck like mosquito
so open up said the taco to the burrito motherfucker
dont be nice dont be nice
drop all the fuckery stop it you ugly ignoramus
dont be nice dont berude and brainless
dont besuper basic
dontmove if youre contagious
dont be nicela la  la la  la
dont be niceim not listening
got nothing nice to say thendont be nice
gather the wicked to sacrifice
sucking the dick of the antichrist
kicking the bucket is vital to life i know thats the price
dont becandy striped
dont beparasites
dontdo me dirty
dontthink youre worthy
donthurt me
mercy is not a courtesy currently that occurs to me
i turn up eternally you will not stop it
truemy crew hotter than hot pockets
we do what we do because its true to us
while few puppets in suits up at the top profit
and if you got a new coup then i do not knock it
but i bukkake your bugati with snot rockets


i got a years supply of capsules
i got a bottle full of friends
theyre always right around
to come show me the town
delivered through a filtered lens
my doctor says im being reckless
that quittings risky for my health
but if i had to choose
i know id rather lose my life
than have to lose myself

id like us to spend some alone time
but if i slide into a zone
dont take it personal
you gotta understand
my brain has got a mind of its own
i dont know if im close to drowning
or if im finally free
i touch my artery
and watch my fingertips bob up and down like buoys at sea


ill be gone when you read this so i just wanted to say
im sorry to the couple decent people who got in the way
and maybe there was a point at which this all could have been different
but this is the position were in and its pointless to wish that it isnt
theyll all be gawking when i walk in the door
cocking my shotgun hammer and they drop to the floor
the clocks shatter i scatter the jock horde and splatter the chalkboard
it matters a lot more than half of you thought
when you were knocking me like im a laughingstock
and a weakling a freak and creep i was mocked and ignored
youre sorry now but talk is cheap   shoulda thought it before
youre the sorry flock of sheep who made me rot to the core
thanks for tuning into the top rated crew in the news
feels great to us that were the one that viewers would choose
im hearing through my producer
weve got the scoop on the name and the favorite food of the shooter
plus an interview with a student
whos been fed through a tube she was shot in the head
were gonna bring you a segment live from her hospital bed
well try to bring you the spin through your preexisting opinions
but if we miss it switch it to our sister network instead
of course we know this situation is tragic
but take a minute to appreciate our fabulous graphics
and well be back in action with up to the second reports
after a couple of words from all our loyal sponsors of course
so like us vine us and tweet to connect
twentyfour point seven were giving ya what youre craving
we live to deliver live the kinda coverage youve come to expect
were always here for you

we come together in this hour of need
to the honor the innocent victims of this cowardly deed
of course i share your sentiment as your voice in the senate
but lets accept nothing ever could have been done to prevent it
its just the strange inner visions of a deranged individual
full of rage full of hate full of vitriol
but i gotta mention that its sick and insane
my opponents twisting your pain for political gain
thats lame
and i think its a damn shame
it doesnt give anyone power to cast blame
because the past is past and its best that we keep things the same
so my chads and my staceys go back to the mall
fill your bags out at macys and chat in the hall
and i hope im the vote that you cast in the fall
cause i care for you its true


one day you opened up your eyes inside of you
you didnt get to pick the rules or pick the past or set the pace
or cast the cast and crew
you didnt get to pick your starting place
and though it was a race you didnt understand
you simply lined up on the blocks and when the pistol popped you ran
and when you tripped and dropped you picked yourself up off the ground
and picked your scabs and knew you had to pick a plan to end what you began
as you got older there were days of cold surrender
days of shrugged whatevers folded in with days of shocking splendor
but as time advanced the lovely days were covered up from view
by an advancing melancholy haze that hovered near the dew
yet there were moments
there were these pure arresting moments when you stepped outside your head
outside your pain outside control outside the bullshit out of body out of rage
outside the need to get it get it you will never get it
thats okay

had a little spotwhere you been going through a lot
wanna shove it to the bottombut a trouble gonna bubble to the top
then the bubble gonna popand the hustle never ever gonna stop
cause you get up in the morning get ahead get to bed and then you do it all again until the moment that you drop
you need a plotwhat you wanna witness with this life you got
you kicked and fought tryna get up in your skin and pick this lock
that ticking clock lets you know that bitch you got these situations witchu
issues someone fit to quick should sit you down to talk
ever wonder whos the crazy the onepeople walking to work as if nothing is off
but if a person really got it they would be cracking a bottle on somebodys head and looting from shops
are there times youre alone knowin nobodys home but you walk around mutterin under your breath second guessing shit saying goddammit goddammit goddammit just whispering soft
do you ever get lost deep in your thoughts tripping when you think about the cost of seeing this through
when you tie your stomach into knots that you dont know how to undo
but do you ever have another moment after that when you can see
theres no one way this has to be or maybe thats just me


im breathing deep then i leap in
im going under
like eating that vs the key to how we can beat global hunger
achieve total peace on earth
im a freak im a local wonder
more lung capacity than freddie mercury vocal numbers
i plunder the briny deep
a spelunker plunging in hunkering down in between those puffy pink walls
like a fallout bunker
and if i never emerge to the surface dont gimme shit
in twenty years im back like kimmy schmidt
hold up wait
cause i really gotta set one thing straight
im not chowing on the chocha so that youll reciprocate
i just go in
no strings
tastes great
fun times
i got a wand tongue
im doing sorcery
if you dont want none
well thats just more for me

im going down on you like i like it but bruh im lyin
cause i dont like it i love it that shits my valentine
one tiny warningim dining on your gourmet form until the morning
performing like itll stop global warming
my palate has got no equal
talent could vanquish evil
and maybe make rick moranis be in the ghostbusters sequel
one taste and im wailing god bless
until you quiver i will not rest
licking repeatedly like your beavers a square reader
and my tongue is a visa debit card that failed to process
its like the miracle worker and im blind and im deaf and dumb
plus each inch of my bodys numb except for the tip of my tongue
and each wikipedia topics printed in microscopic raised ink on your clit
so the single option i got to know something about this wonderful globe that
we come from so locate your swollen bean and then probe the folds of it
fiendishly til you cum about infinity times
and baby that isnt a crime

given our planets gender ratio
itd be a mockery glossing over fellatio
meaning that really fucking quick
i gotta touch on sucking dick
many guys visualize giving bjs and say eww
but can we just please give smoking pole a calm objective view
im pretty straight but ill state sexualitys an arc
maybe i can suck a flashlight so my soul will not be dark
why couldnt i get sexual with a man at all
at thirteen i was in my bedroom fucking stuffed animals
if i can bang an inanimate object cant i jam the crotch of a man in my jaw and softly massage it
fellas vomit like what if the sausage is smelling hella funky
dont you wash your fucking junk b
of course i wouldnt devour icky salami
but that goes the same for encountering stinky punani
so in this scenario where i brush my teeth with a penis
lets assume that the penis were dealing with sparkles the cleanest of all
penis penis on the wall
with those well proportioned balls

so lets say youre okay with your lips around a cock
but you still cant wrap your mind around the final moneyshot
dont give up if the nut is what truly makes it foul
then just get him close to busting and hand him a paper towel
yup no gravy on your chin
yup everybody wins
yup squirrel to an acorn
dudes like to look at dicks in their straight porn
put your hands up if you got hangups
if i could get with it id have a wider ocean im fishing in
but im inhibited by my social conditioning
so where my heads at present the odds are gloomy
that i would agree to feast on a d thats presented to me
but im not officially ruling out
that at some point in my life ill have a dingaling in my mouth


and the clouds are red and pink like theyre wearing a tube of lipstick
the sun is dimming while dipping a toe into the pacific
just gimme a hot jacuzzi
a spliff and well watch a movie
im spiffy man in a jiffy im lifted and living groovie

i found the fountain of youth and went skinny dipping up in it
i pick up the lucky pennies epiphanies every minute
i run the money to coinstar and with the cash from the ticket
i snatch my homies whatever they want at dennys and kick it
til the mothafuckin sun rise
so many folks i love right here
but it hasnt been a good night
until the shit gets kinda weird

i got a stylish private island inside of my mind the size of hawaii
and when im vibing youre likely to find me deep in my psyche
hiding out peeping a flying v of neon pelicans filling the psychedelic horizon like
wow what just happened
ill please have what he is having
and how can i come ride that wave

dont give a damn if im damp i dance in the rain
i decided to celebrate like the sky is dumping champagne on me
paint every clap of thunder as heaven popping a bottle
jump in and paddle the deepest puddles
strap on my goggles
i gotta seek what i lack
when im weak gotta act
im a freak its a fact
but i cant say that i mind
gotta leave those thoughts behind
and i hop in my car and i bob in my seat
when im dropping the beat as i mob the beach
and i stop and i park at the top of a cliff in the dark
and im digging on the stars in the sea
shining like a fistful of diamonds
that somebody went and threw into the sky but they ricochet off
and a couple of em fell into the water and they sink the bottom
and i think that i saw some
but i blink and lost em
and i drink in the awesome view
infinite kilometers of water and the tiny ships moving across em
if im getting money then i get it while i can
but if im not i better live it up and dammit i demand
to give it every single breath i got inside of me and try to be the man


you say its your thing to be honest
like its kind of this token of pride
well to be honest youre kind of a goddess
but being with you kind of kills me inside
you want me to explain it well
its sort of this look in your eye
like youre cooking an egg on the hood of your car cause you looked at it hard
but my heart is the egg and youre watching it fry
im not gonna cry im not gonna lie i am gonna cry
but not right here
give me like a minute let me get up in my feelings while i pop my beer
shit is getting muddy and im seeking out the buddy
at the bottom of the bottle but its not quite clear
what you expect from me
when youre disrespecting me

wanna treat me like a dog on a leash
well thats your prerogative sheesh
or does she wanna see what we got
when the saga repeats nada capeesh
im not a complete wretch
i fetch i sit a bit but im not gonna stay
but if you wanna see me you can see my feets
and my cute little cheeks when im walkin away
you can see me sitting on the dock at the bay
you can see me lickin on my crotch like a stray
but if youre gonna see me like a prop in a play
gotta say ill be skippin what you got for the day
maybe youll be thinking that im hot in the head
or im sick of pickin at my chicken pox in the bed
you can think what you like i think ill take a hike


give a hater a hug
cause even haters get love
tell a hater cheer up cheer up


hey thats the city
traffics always shitty
if you cant kick it happily then dammit thats a pity
you dont even have to be some hackie sacking hippie
for you to be relaxed and free like janet jacksons titty
so wave your freak flag
if they dont like it theyre a d bag
they deserve a tea bag
if they want to be mad
you could give em knee pads
tell them to s on your d or your v
maybe daddy was mean
or they got the tiniest penis
or the hater gene
and you ended up in between it
and it seems that theyre a little bit insecure
so they want you to feel smaller than an insect sure sucks
when they hear what i recorded
and they wish id been aborted
but it dont make me sore
i got to love them more


i get a lot of people judging my
stuff that i
put into the public eye
i used to wonder why
so many people would say that im gay and i should just give up and die
now i shove my pride
and all of that stuff aside see
most of these haters that be commenting on youtube
they respond with anger cause its something that theyre used to
something in their childhood that left them with a loose screw
in their cabezas
we dont choose who raise us
no patience is given for the way that youre livin
so i just made a decision
to say i forgive em
and give em a chance to make it in this unfavorable system
before they do something crazy and shit in the name of religion
you sayin you christian but hate someone whos different than you
ask yourself what the leader of your religion would do
now roll up on a hater with some out stretched arms
it aint gonna do nobody no harm


some got hits about the racks that they earn
say theres benjamins and jacksons in their pockets to burn
but when they shoot the video producers pass around a bucket
full of rented jewelry for them to rock and return
i know a straight edge rapper who acts like a sheep herder
a vegan on the mic whose screaming that meats murder
but when everybodys sleeping he be creeping
slugging back the whiskey
hating himself and sneaking a cheeseburger
theres a pop idol at the top of the charts
and when her records being cut shes on the beach in st barts
while a session singer who didnt have the face to make it
signs a nondisclosure agreement and belts out her parts
its hard cause i got bars that are big uppin woody allen
but maybe hes a predator whose diggin in his talons
theres a balance and often i dont know how to feel
in a fake and tainted world seek the real

we dismiss our heroes skeletons no matter how grim
my fans saying id be honored to be injured by him
well fam this branch is thin but ill go out on a limb
to say she didnt love her ulna poking out of her skin
being pumped full of morphine and tied to machines
they cut off my jeans i heard her in the ambulance scream
shes in school to do tattoos and mighta had nerve damage
so i could have cost a girl a chance at her dream
meanwhile he pops painkillers until the dude is numb
knew i was a stupidass just not that im a ruthless one
youth is easily influenced
so should you be rooting for me if i touch a thousand lives
but on the way i ruin some
the rule of thumb is all publicity is your advantage
but human lives are not collateral damage
bandage the wounded then vanish
blank as the newest of canvases
when they zoom in the cameras give them the truth


youre officially welcome to grab your crotches
synchronize your watches and pour us a couple scotches
people still as statues cant catch you turn pockets empty
if theyre packed with plenty move some to ones lacking any
while i take a crack at hacking the bank to jack em to cover high debts
youre screening floating bullets with a butterfly net if theres any screaming
pause it and cut out the sound deposit the slugs underground
im positive that we dont fuck around
no we go scooping up the diesel thats leaking a sinking tanker
forever stuck at anchor like beetles get stuck in amber
halted like the thaw of the iceberg that shoulda sank her
halted right beside the temperature spike and the spread of cancer
and all my peoples engagements and babies my friends are making
we quit getting lamer days quit getting later life quits being labor quick
you should come through to our party dude bring your crew bring an army
youth is inside of the heart the future can never harm me
were never tardy
late or early dont worry well wait cause were in no hurry to see those pearly gates
i sit outside and watch the pigeon shit and tiny airplanes hanging in the sky and then i
move this crowdto join as converts to the church of blessed concerts and then conjure up some conversation
yes im proudmy country is my heart and so in every combination we all rep a common nation
that is howi know that all we lepers and we shepherds join together now in holy congregation everybody
stop right now

some days i throw my hands up like this shit right here is hopeless
but today i throw my hands up like this shit right heres the dopest
ill never sew my familys holes up saying hocus pocus
so i focus love on what is whole and chase my magnum opus
theres so much more to life before i leave this skin behind me
right now im feeling finer than aaliyah in the ninetys
yeah today im feeling firmly like my faith could never burn me
like im apt to move that mountain just by glaring at it sternly
san francisco used to seem bigger than jupiter
how impossibly big it be  this symmetry
this brutality and beauty and synergy
and beyond what well live to see  i know nothing can limit me
just take everything ever and we are that times infinity


youve got knives in your broken heart
im outside in my go kart
so cut your last pair
and put up your black hair in a bun
and come fast we can run like mascara
you got force like joan of arc
and he falls short like bonaparte
and you deserve greater i know im no savior
but im here right now so lets go
kinda feels like weve been running every day of our lives
and shattering hearts and havin ours cracked
but if you went and threw the broken hearts in a pile
and added the stack then what do you have
you in the black deep in the red
if youre in your bed then you should come meet me instead
and out of the misery you know youve got a friend
said you got me
they want us movin at the speed of light but we wont hurry
lets hit the city and stay out so late that it gets early
like early on when we were livin on the cheapest thrills
because the town we fell in love with has the steepest hills
but those downs rebound to ups
tried to push dads coupe and torch the clutch
and they built us with extra gears and our cars run on exs tears
last night i realized im still sleepin on my mattress edge
saving room for someone whos not coming back to bed
but if we meet i got room here in the shotgun seat
but if youd rather take the keys please ill put up my feet
we pay taxes we live frugal
wear new suits to old friends funerals
have true loves until theyre false


theres something wrong with her
theres something wrong with me
i dont think thats so wrong we came by it honestly
and honestly i think mostly everybody does
i dont blame you if you need to catch a buzz
ive built so much armor but ring the alarm
im in love with someone whos bringing me harm
ill pick lovers who got monsters and we bond on mental health
til they remind me of whats ugly in myself

im always on the brink
about to fly or sink
a minion with opinions told me that i shouldnt think so hard
that shit just made me think so hard i couldnt sleep a wink
washed my red flags with my white flags and now all my laundrys pink
im petty at best someone to pity at worst
putty in beautiful hands potty mouth ready to curse
cursed to be curious if all this is a scam
and i had to google narcissist to check if thats what i am

either you get nothing
but they make you pay and pay
or you get it till they take it all away
every day every day
it amazes me a hundred brand new faces
but im still trying to figure out who they is shi 
i dont wanna settle one bit
bet that im gonna battle for somebody but if
i look at what we got and catch rot
then im gonna come in with a hatchet and i cut it down quick
cut around rust cut around mold
everybody ends up cold
heads gotta roll thats life
and you gotta be the neck or the knife
but im told that i cant quite quit this
constant itch to matter my restless drive to win
thats driving me that drove away the closest of my kin
how i twist away when deep relationships begin
and shit theres still the biness of the thinness of my skin
im vain im lame im strange and yet so typical
i make the same mistakes i dont change shit and still
my folks age and age i hate to face facts
and i feel i wear their faces as a mask


one day you opened up your eyes inside of you
you didnt get to pick the rules or pick the past or set the pace
or cast the cast and crew
you didnt get to pick your starting place
and though it was a race you didnt understand
you simply lined up on the blocks and when the pistol popped you ran
and when you tripped and dropped you picked yourself up off the ground
and picked your scabs and knew you had to pick a plan to end what you began
as you got older there were days of cold surrender
days of shrugged whatevers folded in with days of shocking splendor
but as time advanced the lovely days were covered up from view
by an advancing melancholy haze that hovered near the dew
yet there were moments
there were these pure arresting moments when you stepped outside your head
outside your pain outside control outside the bullshit out of body out of rage
outside the need to get it get it you will never get it
thats okay

had a little spotwhere you been going through a lot
wanna shove it to the bottombut a trouble gonna bubble to the top
then the bubble gonna popand the hustle never ever gonna stop
cause you get up in the morning get ahead get to bed and then you do it all again until the moment that you drop
you need a plotwhat you wanna witness with this life you got
you kicked and fought tryna get up in your skin and pick this lock
that ticking clock lets you know that bitch you got these situations witchu
issues someone fit to quick should sit you down to talk
ever wonder whos the crazy the onepeople walking to work as if nothing is off
but if a person really got it they would be cracking a bottle on somebodys head and looting from shops
are there times youre alone knowin nobodys home but you walk around mutterin under your breath second guessing shit saying goddammit goddammit goddammit just whispering soft
do you ever get lost deep in your thoughts tripping when you think about the cost of seeing this through
when you tie your stomach into knots that you dont know how to undo
but do you ever have another moment after that when you can see
theres no one way this has to be or maybe thats just me


you will if you didnt feel it before
ever since i was a kid never really been bored
swinging from building to building with my umbilical chord
but they dont know what i really endured
they say godzilla been summoned but were not running
attila the hun is coming were killin his horde
spilling my innards i fell on my sword
and now my blood is filling up from the ceiling to floor
im swimming though it im swallowing fluid
knew i had to do it so i grew like a million gills
cause evolution is kill or be killed
your mrs isnt equipped to be having kids
have her listen to what im spitting
its like sniffing fertility pills
this illegitimate village idiot bridging original shit with digital
catching a carrier pigeon sticking a chip in his wing and hitching a ride
but theres a glitch in the system inside
got this ambition im keeping the freshest fish in my kitchen
i catch em quick when get em to bite
this kind of killing could fill a pelican bill
and my delicatessen will keep my recipe tight
you kinda gollumy go ahead try to follow me
but if youre solid we build a colony bruh
calling me maybe they popping molly
these babies are sniffling like theyre chuggin some quality phở

im playing with the houses money now cause i thought we were on our way out during the cuban missile crisis i was ah in my late teensi fell asleep waiting for the missile to fall dead center on my apartment crash through the ceiling and that was gonna be the end of everything and i was amazed when i woke up the next morning and i was still alive


if you want to lose your home
and every penny you own
you want to eat your words
you want your feelings hurt
you want your ego bruised
if you like to lose
if you love regret
you want to die in debt
if you want to shed tears
you want to lose ten years
if you got too much wealth
if you fuckin hate yourself


its the american dream
but if you pull on the thread its gonna tear at the seam
see what i mean we dont tend to scream
baby we just stare at the screen
like its a preacherman up at the pulpit
some with the scars end up holding the bullwhip
another angry kid unloading a full clip
and i could tie a pretty bow on this bullshit
but lets not lie for another second
we see the trouble were rubberneckin
no doublecheckin if its an issue we have to grapple
the words are caught in my adams apple
i make my body a happy chapel
cause every persons a tabernacle
but theres no feeling you gotta hide
so lets all pray to the god inside say it now

thats me with the long arm
screaming at the top dog spilling my blood on the cement
we willing to roll now sick of getting mowed down
fuck if i dope now itd kill me
cause id rather be known for the dealing
they say we gotta know our role
kiss the bottom of the totem pole
set goals and then go for gold
but we hibernate and hide inside our gopher holes
i wanna smoke a bowl a hand on my dick
while the other one is busy clicking the remote control
im no dalai lama of the sofa but i hear i gotta go to
where the sinners face the roasting coals
you say that your heart aint got no holes well bitch please
lets all admit that we got souls like swiss cheese
but wishing isnt gonna fill this abyss
and no hand over hand over fisted riches is fixin whats missin
if i wanna kill this monotony
i know the answer is a light that i got in me
i got no university degree in philosophy
but i know that every babys born with the lock and key


im a phenomenon and i gotta bring pain in the octagon
when i wanna spit game at a soccer mom
i get it quicker than the left lane on the autobahn fast
like ramadan had to battle young padawans all the damn day
im getting naked and im hopping on a wrecking ball
so hot i got the motherfucker a la flambé
i go to mileys house i see that mileys home
i play mileys ribcage with my dick like its a xylie phone
yes that was highly fucked up but my skills are highly honed
and if i was highly hyphy i might be more widely known
cest la vie better pay my fee
they kick it in seattle in a patagonia jacket
they get it in the bay in a plain white tee
hey mami you a pyt
you wanna see me speak then i go go go go
cause every time i get a beat i know i gotta beat it up
i jump the freeway median im savage
cause my mode is that im meaner than the average
like my teacher taught me when i heard the crowd applaud
i thought i was an atheist until i realized im a god
it could hurt a bit when i murder shit
in a moment ill be taking off a tourniquet
when i burn them and i hit them in the sternum
i dont even got to enter but im gonna win the tournament
thats what im all about
i do what i got to do and never gonna pout
and i hope that it would have been the end of it and im out
but they never tend to give me the benefit of the doubt
ever since i was a little kid
i know that ive been looking for the hot hot spotlight
and if you really wonder what i think about the competition
they were not not not tight
ive been reading my scripture
every photo bomber wanna be in my picture
and you better bet im living every single day
like its the motherfucking catalina wine mixer
bada bing bada boom
when i walk in im the king of the room
and i get it locked in like a king in a tomb
when i spit a toxin and they cough on the fumes
cause im back in the nick of time and attacking the fickle mind
im a jackal ill rip his hide ima tackle him pick a fight
i be dracula set to bite in the black of the bitter night
and im out poof


im so far from perfect
you still loved me when i so far from deserved it
if im so brave why does looking you in the eye take every ounce of my courage
i hang my face to the linoleum and count the freckles on the floor
all of us all of us are a galaxy of tiny little storms
the good and evil in me wage a bloody civil war
the missiles whistle through me then the rebel pistols roar
i shiver and the final slivers of my chivalry retreat my shriveled core
i cant imagine that ill ever be happy like before
before before
were sitting in a field in golden gate park off fulton and fourth
and ive never felt less alone
just a block from the home ive outgrown
five feet and forty years to the right from where dad proposed
so far its been worth it


some got hits about the racks that they earn
say theres benjamins and jacksons in their pockets to burn
but when they shoot the video producers pass around a bucket
full of rented jewelry for them to rock and return
i know a straight edge rapper who acts like a sheep herder
a vegan on the mic whose screaming that meats murder
but when everybodys sleeping he be creeping
slugging back the whiskey
hating himself and sneaking a cheeseburger
theres a pop idol at the top of the charts
and when her records being cut shes on the beach in st barts
while a session singer who didnt have the face to make it
signs a nondisclosure agreement and belts out her parts
its hard cause i got bars that are big uppin woody allen
but maybe hes a predator whose diggin in his talons
theres a balance and often i dont know how to feel
in a fake and tainted world seek the real

we dismiss our heroes skeletons no matter how grim
my fans saying id be honored to be injured by him
well fam this branch is thin but ill go out on a limb
to say she didnt love her ulna poking out of her skin
being pumped full of morphine and tied to machines
they cut off my jeans i heard her in the ambulance scream
shes in school to do tattoos and mighta had nerve damage
so i could have cost a girl a chance at her dream
meanwhile he pops painkillers until the dude is numb
knew i was a stupidass just not that im a ruthless one
youth is easily influenced
so should you be rooting for me if i touch a thousand lives
but on the way i ruin some
the rule of thumb is all publicity is your advantage
but human lives are not collateral damage
bandage the wounded then vanish
blank as the newest of canvases
when they zoom in the cameras give them the truth


got an issue but its getting bigger and bigger
in the beginning it was something minor
got a rat up in my kitchen and we gotta get rid of it
so were bringing in a tiger
theres something inside her
thought you were blissful
i heard you did it with a pink handled pistol
but sadness it tend to latch on
and it wont let go like a pitbull
dont even know if you left a note
should we blame the depakote
or vilify the abilify
you were trying to find your vanilla sky
then you unravel
face down on rock bottom fucking chewing gravel
because a humans so fragile   what can you do

i know its sappy
but i want my family to be happy
without becoming flatter than a sheet of paper
an army of zombies shuffling through a vapor
but i know folks who found something beautiful
and they credit the pharmaceuticals
for slaying the demons that theyre running from
it might have saved their lives and im one of em
but theres a limit to the shit you can endure
you get a prescription and youre thinking that its pure
but baby maybe its a problem when you got a problem
and you get addicted to the cure
the spike aint no mystery
were any penny in a billion dollar industry
and theres a mothafucka living on the hill pushing pills
stacking bills off our misery


happys not a faucet thatll flow when a handle is turned
i wanna handle my shift but it hasnt occurred
i need the stamina keep on like my grandmama
when im not on camera i gotta be a man of my word
and be a greater guy not some thin as paper guy
like the times that georgie porgie kissed the girl
and made her cry
saying see ya later bye shit i say is pretty strange
coming back for christmas and we bitch on how the city changed
fuck it man were changing too look at what we going through
mama used to buy me shirts she said that i would grow into
but its draping on me like an apron or a cape a great tsunami
wave of cotton that im caught in that she bought at ross
i know the cost of it was probably awesome
but my style is sorta sloppy
ill fit it when i blossom like a california poppy
the tears are freezing on my cheek in boston out in copley
and i dont really know why no i dont really know why

so pour that liquor out i never chickened out
but if i got to make a second pick id take a different route
but a grip of my decisions pretty mickey mouse
i tried to join the twentyseven club they kicked me out
it was like im limping into heaven while my dick is out
and theres amy winehouse sitting on a cloud and drinking stout
but she spits it out the moment i come gliding in
shes all like come on joplin who the fuck invited him
hide all of the heinekens no they dont know my name
my heart is lowkey broken so im taking novocain
and jimmy morrison the doors and brian jones you know the stones
are joking toking on a roach playing a poker game
i know that im a bastard the walls are alabaster
jimi plays his stratocaster jamming out with kurt cobain
theyre playing purple rain or maybe purple haze
and kurt says how the fuck they let this jerk in with his hurtful ways
i try to jump and spread my wings like im a bird of prey


what was i thinking when i headed to socal
everybody gotta order the low cal or no cal meal
i dont even enjoy guilt
i think the city turned my semen to soymilk
but im a motherfuckin hypocrite
acting like i never give a shit
but now i think about it maybe a tad bit
cause pretty baby i be ready to admit
im thinking maybe i will never be brad pitt
want the celebrity you gotta be bat shit
to want to be a piece of meat we treat em as cold cuts
but go nuts when we see em wiping their own butts
and the crowd goes wild
but we dont smile if you got no style
gotta be kidding me giving the pretty people the key to the city
i dont even know

we struttin
aint nobody gotta tell us nothing
because a rose is a rose and i am what i am
and i wear it like campaign button
i dont want a side eye
i say bye bye
roll up another one and hand me a mai tai
because the people who be running the show
are kinda like the season how they come and they go
and well be living while they looking for parking
and well be digging while they woofing and barking
they kicking in the door and hoping to barge in
but this is what you get theres nothing to bargain
if its a hundred to one and were under the gun
im not gonna be groveling for the governors pardon
dont gotta suck in your gut if you want to guzzle a bud
im about it baby you can party with us


everywhere i look it seems like everybodys pairing off
im staring at the pairs like they were tits on lara croft
even all the dogs i see are clicking so terrific
picking out their favorite puppys ass to sniff and stickin with it
all the faker single ladies twerkin to beyoncé
every single one of em is somebodys fiancée
you never spilled your guts you wanted to yell your say
wait a couple years and try again when theyre divorcees
all the gentlemen are trynna get the pussy wanna make that pelvis scream
but when i hit it and i quit it then it never really helps my self esteem
we want some tonsil hockey but we got hecka cocky
overfished the ocean so were running low on tekka maki
sushi douchey dudes are saying do me but were doomed
we run away from keepers and go creepin on the goons
most men and women full of crap need a laxative
want the ass when im waxin it uncle sam how im taxin it
do a backflip and try to land in it then abandon it pretty soon were back to

wonderland is where ill find an alice who is radical
but im drunk on facebook now and diving down that rabbit hole
checkin on my ex and soon im creepin on her lover
and when the picture buffers i see her new boyfriends buffer than me
got those upper pecs his fuckin v neck couldnt cover
my dick is  pretty lonely but my nuts still got each other
i suffer suffer from a habit yes im an addict
but someone else is out there its just simple mathematics
theres over seven billion mothafuckas on the planet and four billion of us are of legal age
thats two billion ladies four billion tittays and i bet a couple of em arent engaged
and i get it youve been looking for the one but they been running trynna hide like kony
and youre gonna find em if youre getting back into the saddle baby ride that pony
and if you never get over that early lover then it sucks for you
gotta admit that its difficult to be watching her with him but everybody want a love thats true
im waiting batin patiently yo im a catch
im losing my head playing musical beds and looking for the one that match


and yes yes lets lets lets get some takeout
press our hearts together like when kids make barbies make out
lets make out no toothpaste
i only want to know how you taste
we dont need to tie no shoelace
and we dont need to pack no suitcase
to to find a new place let our moment linger
well weave our hands together and then kiss this braid of fingers
until the whisper whisper of times undying rivers
come decorate our skin with crows feet spider veins and fissures
but we wont cry we wont cry well step into that cyclone
together when were blinded and our minds erode like limestone
and all we can remembers how we make each other feel then


cause it isnt the fashion the cash and isnt the trashing hotels
its the pit of the passion you feel in the moment you crashed and you fell
then get up and youre smashing it well like it was a pistachio shell
and you gotta be gnashing your teeth and be giving em hell
cause to love is a radical act give your brother a pat on the back
and if you get a panic attack feel like youre at the back of the pack
an opinions exactly that if they say that your magic is black
just do what you do when you do what you do keep on pulling that rabbit from hat
you might think that youre ruined you might think youre defeated
if you love what youre doing youve already succeeded
but theres gonna be bleeding when another one bites that dust
so get ready to beat it cause it might be us and im telling em
that the journey is oh so slow and we wanna say no no no
cause to make it is difficult but we go go go
and my father was telling me that i better be ready ride on through
cause i know that its tough but its gotta be somebody so then why not you

carry the spark as were marching into the darkness
i dont care if theyre marking where they bury my carcass
im working in this circus and searching for purpose
learning from the bird whos perched on top of the church and chirpin a sermon
you want that early worm be the determined sparrow
flying in loops around the sternest scarecrow
once cupid hit me with his burning arrow
he lit the lava in my churning marrow
so when im tested i remember ive been blessed
with that tender ember resting left of center in my chest
and yes if you fuck with us youll see my game face
cause no matter who you pray to when you say grace
and no matter where you come from in this great space
every single person is escaping from the same place
so if you got a flame thats blazing hot within
take a deep breath and feed it oxygen


its eightysix when my mama has me
thirty seconds later when the doctor slaps me
fifteen years til i get my permit
and then four more til were in the backseat
of a taxi crazy youngfolk
and then sun came up but none woke
its four point twenty when i made that dumb joke
i was saying something like blah blah blunt smoke
and then its later in the afternoon
in my backyard when we write this tune
probably eight months til you first heard it
so punch the clock adjust your tie
spike the punch and touch the sky
life is hard and then you die
so lets all go hard tonight

if time is money a seconds a penny a minutes buck a couple years are a milly im getting really really filthy
bitch get me a bathtub
im filthy rich watching my pennies stack up
i shower in a typhoon
if time is dimes then im a tycoon
ill glue em together and the climb to the moon
climb to the moon climb to the moon
we on today today matt laur
every twentyfour we going like jack bauer
hear the bell ringing im thinking its that hour
turning on my light and i set it to max power
lets keep it going and going im talking moment to moment we live the high and the low
and then when were broken like cracking open a coconut we pull ourselves together again and we gotta go


i got that brown grass dogs come pee on
your grass so bright its neon
green and tie dye and grows a mile high
well be betrayed by the seeds that we sow
tiny blades grow and stab the earth from below
your dying dreams bleeding out in the snow
you with the crumbling hips
she sees strangers eat oranges and clenches her fists
in these miles of highway
youre the prettiest pileup that ive ever glimpsed
im lost in the awful withdrawals
grass seems much greener beyond these old walls
but my worries so small
when i walk through those hospital halls


i hear a little patience what a man need
but bottling the feelingsll make a man bleed
the words leave my mouth in a stampede
you press my buttons like i were a nintendo
me and her up in a permanent limbo
its like its nothing when were burnin the indo
the streetlights like a blur in the window
i got no cause to feel i was betrayed
its just a symptom of the of the game we played
we pull the hearts out of each others chests pull the pins out of the hearts
and toss em back and forth like theyre grenades
hot potato hot potato what did you do
blow my fuckin arm off and then kiss the booboo
hit me with a shovel and then say i dig you
and be colder than an igloo
when you want me i dont want you when i want you you dont want me
when i sing a tune and you sing it too then its womp womp in the wrong key
you always let me go and do my thang
but im always coming back againboomerang


and they wonder what our parents say
and they wonder how well raise our children
and they tell me that im living with a monster
and they whisper that she took up with a villain
but i dont see dragons scales
and i dont see claws and fangs
all im looking at is arms that hold me
brown eyes that understand
and when she closed those eyes one final time no pipers came
but i know i got a love thats truer than a military snipers aim
but we wont die in vain
tie that chain around my waist
and pull me from the bottom of the pit of hell up to your final resting place

we were trynna run from the city
had the hope and the pride of the kids
people wanna put up walls to divide us
where do we come from where do we go
you could fill up the sea with the things i dont know
but i know what i feel and i know when its real
and i hope that we heal
were two drops of the blood and the tears
over thousands of years of the clash of the steel
im not blind to the cycle
were pressed in the spine of a bible
they define the divine by the title
but what did christ say to be kind to my rival
youre my kind of revival
its true ya my favorite hallelujah
you my you my favorite hallelujah


she freaked when she saw me
calmly eating my tamale
she followed me home from the diner
now all day she be on me
on the other side of the street
you can see her through the blinds if you peek
with a book propped up on her knees and the blue hair
what do you care when im home what i do there

youre creeping out my neighbors
when they grab the paper
you probably think im inside
like some kind of savior
solving world hunger
working on sudoku
and filling in the numbers
polishing my halo
ooh i bet you wonder

life can be bogus
we all wanna be noticed
but were the ones in the background fuzzy
when the ones in the front are in focus
and its pretty difficult in general
when you really think a person is incredible
and i get it why youre setting em up on a pillar
but the bigger the tumble the bigger the pedestal

frankly i am flattered
we all want to matter
do you see when you pass by
that we let the grass die
im late with the rent check
we park on the lawn
like were a bunch of fuckin rednecks
im just watching netflix
jerking off to porno
and i got a suspicion
you think my life is different
i get your confusion
but you got some delusions
yeah im fucking awesome
but i gotta out you
you probably think im in there
writing songs about you


we dont just write poems we got a mic jones
giving a fuck ripping it up in different time zones
i know its so apropos that its gotta be said
that i was flowing so hard in the car off the top of my head
when i drove home
that my own flows gave me road dome

so go bone man but fuck it if youre celibate
screw the music if you do it cause youre sellin it
well equipped man we do it for the hell of it
never delicate hella ripped off the elements
earth wind fire water top rock echo box

yo man we got cosby doing jello shots
ive been tellin em the melanins irrelevant
im yellin and youll feel it from the ceiling to the sediment
intelligent epic and reppin the bay
youre trippin if youre thinking that youre getting away

the sun is comin up and runnin through me
if weather is gettin better dont be gloomy
lets get together gather up and get it moving and
if you dont like my motherfuckin music sue me
a new me a new reason to be so unseasonably fine
the ill summer grill serving supper with free sides
cut to the b side
its watsky covered in batter and butter and refried
the speakers are pushin the roof
the tweeters the woofers are proof
the meters are up in the booth
the subs the mids the highs
the highers the lows the cones all bump
duh were amped thats the god damn truth
we flowing low in this moment only to sew and be growin over the roses and now that we broke it open we know that were dope enough were hopin no one just cant get live
this is how we get amplified

yeah i got something to speak on
on the kind of song once heard you just keep on
we out in cali here keeping the trees blown
so lean on me need more gain than freeman
turn me up a little ima get a reaction
yeah the games filled up with a little distraction
but im passionate yes somewhat of a manson
here to murder words maybe hold the rest of em ransom
wonderin what im gonna do to blow all them lids back i tell em to get back thats how we leave an impact
in track form if you dont feel me then give me my disc back
and be ready to get you a diss track
shit man im playing but somewhat of a monster
when i get down to laying these songs
soon well be there at a concert
playing as loud as the
bay will allow watsky good thing youre around to lead the crowd


you were on the bed in that pretty little thong
with a ribbon on it when i said to pick a song
you had a feeling for some healing with that marvin gaye
begins with lets ends with get it on
i get it youre ready to fuck
and its time for me to let it erupt
but i got a confession to make
when i get nervous
i can never get it up
i gotta get it together i better meditate
i want to set it straight
i gotta separate the passion i had
from the fear that came
alone i get a boner when i hear your name
but when im near the game i veer to shame
clearly my dear it appears the same
severely lame
my genitals flustered
make a last stand like general custer
id take a cluster fuck or a just some animal lust
i know youre looking for a man who can thrust
i was in the sack with a faster women than danica patrick
when i had a panic attack
i can never fake it i make another mistake
and im aching and so i pray to the have the pastor take
an erection collection and pass the plate
but no one donated so i had to masturbate
i know the girls want it
im close and if it grows i can put a condom on it
her moan is onomatopoetic
i groan because my bone is gone as soon as get it
got a risky trick for frisky chicks
have a drink then blame it on whiskey dick
wait a couple hours ill be horny good
and can wake up with a little bit of morningwood

i know that many men are waiting
to be penetrating
you think im panting
but im hyperventilating
i would get to mating but im so damn nervous
i called my dick but i cant get service
the worst is im a pervert  i want you
id make harness from your tan brassiere
last night i had a fantasy
were banging hanging from the ceiling like a chandelier
slip into your chimney singing santas here
but its a grand veneer
damn its enough to bring a man to tears
with a hand on my gear
but a strand full of blanks in my bandoleer
there are times when i wish it away
there are nights when i wish i was gay
itd be quicker  i go to theater school
shit i figure i could stick it to pick of the litter
man im sick of it
want to stick a dick in it lick a tit
get some cliterature for the illiterate
hit it in the middle of the night
in the waking hour
when i take a shower we can strip
luckily i studied up on being cuddle buddy
would rather have sucker who fronts
fucking you once making ugly grunts
ill be casanova
im making you mine
maybe later for the sake of taking our time
tonight we can lie naked
if you dont mind waiting
give it like five dates and ill have your thighs shaking
i get her in bed and then were attending a seminar on a bit of sex ed
i hope this song proves
how fast my tongue moves
cause its true i give the best head


your first rap show posted in the back row
of a sea of white kids bent on supermanning that ho
pretty soon youre buying fitted hats and high tops
pretending that youre black enough and rapping with the lights off
its like a cyclops with one closed eye
you can tell me that youre winking but the grin wont lie
and no mouth supplies what your skin tone hides
about a thousand miles south as the jim crow flies
and then were playing he said she said
i see red when i peep a pink cheeked boston meathead
i wanna go bruce lee
when i see him on the t taking up two seats
and say excuse me but would you move if hell froze
you know the subway is the underground railroad
lynch trees have the same white limbs
check out my arms i look just like him

lets you and i get one thing straight
the game never been equal aint no food on my plate
i gave birth to this and you just took it and co opted it and profited
and packaged it and wouldnt give me half of it

i see the color lines
its tough that every other time a brother rhymes
white mothers think of gutter crimes
we keep our standard higher
we dont kick lower rhymes
other times it undermines the fact the mine are over minds

all you gotta do is get past the guilt
we aint living in a house that master built
if you overstand that tell your people what you know
because one of em got enough money to pay back what you owe

yes my great grands had land had slaves
i guess i pressed this record off the bank he made
but i want independance past the declaration
but one down ass white boy cant pay for reparations

im running out of patience while you do the work of satan
like an impulse edu leedz black historys an insult

number one im not trying to tell your story
i just want to sit on my porch drink a forty and spit
number two cause uou can smell bullshit
i just love hip hop
pinkie swear thats it

if you love hip hop respect it
that includes the people who created it and paved the way for this
so that youre making it

well if youre talking on whos making it ill play devils advocate
a lot of black music has white dollars backing it
kwelis got it on lock
rupert murdoch funded rawkus
you looking for the keys then you better check the pockets

ill be checking pockets all right
as soon as it gets dark and all night
imma get my money we can all fight

you taking out the high and the mighty
and their kids
you say kill whitey
i say can i live
youre not black militant
killing us diligent
grab my fam and grandma and light us up like a filament
i thought we were cool now im this close to giving in
just put a bullet in for each missed dose of ritalin


the first thing that happens is the world goes black
you just hear a little snap when your neck rolls back
you dont bite your tongue off or foam at the lips
but before you hit the ground theres a moment of bliss
its like toking a spliff its like shedding your skin
its better than the best train wreck theres even been
you have to let it in as much as its upsetting
to wake up with bruises you dont remember getting
you dont remember how the hell you ended up indoors
you dont remember whether you were wetting your gym shorts
in front of amanda the girl youre after
who already thought you were a fucking disaster
its not like a last will its making me laugh
unless you get your next one while youre taking a bath
im seizing the mic fast at middle school dances
im done being seized and im seizing my chances

maybe true
i got baby blues
you got navy blues
paid your dues
name the tune
name a hue
what shade are you
i see purple people eaters more than world leaders
and ive jumped a couple hurtles burned some sneakers through the meters
please get the medic
let it breathe
and ill be the baddest motherfucking epileptic i can be
i would grieve
asking whys it me sleeping in the er with an iv in my arm and my v card hurting saying god fuck if ima die a virgin
ima grab the first nurse working flirt and draw the curtain
so whos perkin doctor phils pills
tyler durden still ill
thrillville uma thurman hurting in the kill bills
this is to my sick kids
time to flip this shit
depakote adderall ritalin pixie stix
i dont give a fuck what you ridin to the setting sun
use it as a weapon when its said and done

say that im crazy or call it a pitfall
ill win a game of bloody knuckles hitting a brick wall
its pinball hitting the limit to smash that glass
taking a minute to sit in the whip and then im gonna mash on gas
cause ill be crashing that impasse with fat ass syntax
skinny motherfucker off a bucket of slimfast
you ever had a gran mal seizure in gym class
had whiplash back when life was dishing out pimp slaps
fed up and weve all been better but im set to step up
never let up cause the fall is just the setup now to get up
regretll never get the better of me with a sawed off
when im having trouble talking someone knocks my writers block off
if my eyes glaze and my knees drift south
and you ever think to stick a credit card in my mouth
i take mastercard and visa for my risk rewards
im not biting my tongue why dont you bite yours


im in my lucky underwear im feeling debonair
if its a lonely trip to heaven im already there
im in the bedroom and im stepping like im fred astaire
i make it happen battle rapping at my teddy bear
when i was twelve id leave my door open a crack
afraid of getting busted sneaking porno on my mac
i guess i was a freak
until i got caught last week
i was reading booker t i threw the book at me
i go for the lookers but they never look at me
this insanity thats heredity
its my family we can let it be
wish i pretended that mom and dad are dead to me
but i love my dad that motherfucker read to me
my first words were wheres the love
mad smug assed up on a bearskin rug
fashodo my momll show you the photo
i do embarrassing better
i could wear a pink sweater
with a pair of slick pleather pants
derelicte e va ry day and its well known
that i hop off stage with my cell phone
fake a dropped call when everybodys near me
and shout i love you mom so everybody hears me
i need it too and true nothing new but


spun a web of lies took notes from charlotte
throw a red herring paint the white house scarlet
pennsylvania ave was the last red carpet
then bush relapsed like a rehab starlet
i feel carsick
stop the paris hilton carousel
hot as hell and smells like kerosene and caramel
americas flaring and were carrying parasols
paranoid of terror cells parents scared of aerosols
said if you care at all fight for the ones who fall
fight for the ones who cant fight for the one for the all
and fight for the ones who rep and fight for the one percent
at the bottom against the one two one two step for the ones who come correct
i dont wanna sit back with a big mac and a rack of natty ice
six pack on my lap skinemax on blast sticking to the facts of life
said if youre taller better follow who youre steppin on
cause ill be brawling like the fightin irish leprechaun

since i was little ive been fiddling with the riddle
focus like folks addicted to ritalin craftin it with no chisel
you soft as malcolm in the middle
im strong as the nation of islam with malcolm in the middle
uh izza uh izza can you save them
i dont need a chart to see that i look hard to me
theres no chardonay pumping through my arteries
and my heartll say i should take the harder way
if i got a part to play i wont make it bartleby
at least this starter t is feeling like an armor piece
its guarding me like its righteous artistry
so far to lead us to inagaddadavida
to seeking god in your freedom
to god i gotta lead a vida bonita
cause see to lead a beautiful life
is more than eating sleeping and meeting suitable wife
you gotta fight
while ludas throwing bows in a town
ill be throwing blows like little children on the playground
you should know the bay were seeming sorta tame
but we can go insane
and if youre on lower plane like when a boeing lands
my fist detaches at the wrist so ill be throwing hands


i tend to vent a lot
its hard to end a thought
i get pent up and i guess i dont know when to stop
if i get a mental block you can hear a pencil drop
but if not im all talk like a rent a cop
i dont wanna mock
ever yet i let it slip
said i gotta get a grip
cause i know youre delicate
and im pretty adamant
i can learn some etiquette
bet on it that i can talk a book and never edit it
seldom elegant guilty of embellishing
yelling but im holding shit together like im gelatin
were both jealous and selfish im hella slim
but i gotta bigger mouth than a pelican
check a fella sing messing up the melody
i know my alphabet a to l m n o p
i like you it shouldnt be shocking
my hearts beating just as loud as im talking

im a fast talker
louder than a brass knocker
cricket or a grasshopper
not another word
i dont want to ass kiss
sniffing like a mastiff
thatll be my last ditch
effort to be heard
take me as a hostage
im feeling lost
with my neck out like an ostrich
totally absurd
i squawk like a bird
cause my clumsy heart feels like its doing cartwheels
put me in a dunce cap
treat me like a hunchback
say my mind is one track
every single day
call my mug a megaphone
i dont beg and moan
if i get in bed alone
i dont want to say
youre forgiven briefly
if i call you sweet pea
then you say to eat me
and i dont know which way
ive had a taste and i know youre gourmet
an arguments just the makeup foreplay

take the silent type gimme the opposite
you look so damn sexy when youre talking shit
every time i want to say to put a sock in it
i melt again and buy your ass a box of chocolate
i guess thats why they call me georgie porgie puddin pie
before i kiss my girl i put her on a sugar high
and then we cry after a little old how are you
turns into an argument i betll scar you
is it hard to always have to complain
taking something mundane and give yourself a tongue sprain
you talk about your day and go off for a year
and i could walk away or hold the phone off of my ear
i dont love what i hear but ive got to stay
cause man smart girls have a lot to say
i want to shout with someone that im down with
theres no one id rather run my mouth with


in one point thirtyeight they came from sweden
ship shape settlers late looking for eden
the delaware tribe wasnt really keen on leaving
so they bought em out or slaughtered them quick and got to breeding
one point fiftynine they built a fortress
stationed soldiers and gave them horses
but now their forces were losing their resources
moving in the living quick as moving out the corpses
started changing courses when we got the quakers
and they been running town since cromwell met his maker
they didnt take pay cut quakers got their cake up
the paper came triangulating trading with jamaica
now in the one point zeros they took care of biz
built the families through some noble marriages
still in wiilmington doing what their parents did
living up on seventh street in mansions they inherited
one point zero and in step the du ponts
irenee du pont was fleeing the war in france
he made the jaunt cause apparently murder rate
was higher for gentle people spitting on the third estate
he started working late he had grand design
and when we cut a couple fingers off the hands of time
the du ponts were running under delaware like panty lines
they built a mill for small explosives on the brandywine
but gun powders just as temperamental
as the rich kids with ceo potential
its essential to compete for our emergencies
which brings me to a company called hercules

hercules gunpowder started kind of small
dupont had it all were sparkling wall to wall
they were ballin in the fall of one point ninetynine
when tc du pont crawled up the brandywine
now thomas coleman started as a coal man
in the mines in kentucky with his old man
joined whole fam and flipping the strip tease
went from fig leaves all the way to big cheese
never got on his knees for the love it won him
from couple of brothers lewis and russell dunham
they were running shit with colemans muscle
lewis wasnt clueless
but russells on his hustle
now brother lou was colemans true blue man
tc would have an idea and lou drew plans
dupont had seventy percent of gdp
when it came to gun powder and tnt
they bought even bought hercules
scandalous
said the government so brought on anti trust
litigation and they split business up in three
into atlas and dupont and hercules
but certainly they were busting heads
put in work at hercules then made russell prez
in one point twelve up the road from dover
my great great grandfather russ took over

russell dunham we said daddy d
or sugar daddy d to half the family
ran hercules as an affable property
slap on the wrist from capitalist democracy
and so between tc and papa d
a bit improperly they adopt a monopoly
and instead of dotting the is and often crossing the ts
they take a walk in the trees and talk and pocket the cheese
and when russell dropped to his knees his heirs cashed out
every generation after the shares passed down
split between six ladies
and my mother had the stocks till the one point eightys
if stonewall pays my phone calls
if san juan fills my scantron
if every molten shower out in okinawa fueled by smoking powder
pays my broken power send my folks the flowers
if its irrelevant to my intelligence
gimme a shotgun im dropping these pink elephants
ill take a tranquilizer shot and sell the sedatives
out in delaware im well aware the fella lives
all the skeletons in my closet are dead relatives
and then i grow up to be another screw up
but if i blow up
itll be cause they blew up


a couple red sons popping out a new womb
twins come twice once in a blue moon
feeling like a joke in the nude rude humor
we were born premature and they said too soon
sing a new tune act less fickle
most twins cling like a pair of testicles
we havent been tight since we breastfed little
said me on the right and you on the left nipple
said its that simple have to discover
if you act a bit smothered while youre trapped with big brother
nine long months kicking it inside our mother
never kicked her belly hell we only kicked each other
if we suffer we can get well when we grow
get born ready go got a separate embryo
there were weeks you can bet i couldnt eat
looking at my cooking with a set of wooden teeth
opened up my big mouth found that i could speak
so i put another foot in it but now i couldnt leave
its good to see all the losers taking days
to think of dumping shit on you in new creative ways
you can say that its a phase
or some rude complaining crap
its a stupid way to act man but two can play at that
ive been a brat made more than one slip
my lips got unzipped i quipped some dumb shit
our folks were so sick it made them cringe
i followed my jaws lead and came unhinged
im sorry man but can the shit end here
cause we havent really talked in about ten years
and thats ten too many cause if you were anyone else
i wouldnt see you in myself

aching in the chest try to take it from the stress
shrink made me quit i was making him depressed
usually im upbeat tearing through the halls
but instead of bouncing off em i was staring at the walls
care to make the call which separates faster
a fence of placenta an inch made of plaster
a handful of strands of our dna
either we both were alone or it seemed that way
kept to myself id reflect by myself
dude i left and i fucking saw shrek by myself
its no help to assume were less than
to mom its yes maam im groom youre best man
its on the next fam to plan and proceed
but if we smoke weed dont think we odd
no i dont know all the shit youve been through
but ive seen a window and i know ive been too


because of jonestown
because of auschwitz
because the leaves fall and we cant stop it
but that makes fall leaves
imma start a mosh pit
this is your captain
hopping out the cockpit
i forgot my parachute
but i got my bay sounds
so ill be going dummy
rocking on the way down
ill be saying hey ground
howzabout we make out
ill put on some ray brown
you can grab some take out
love isnt more sin love isnt forced in
getting under your skin digging for endorphins
its the portion some of usll forgo
fingers on your torso tapping you in morse code
the opera aria were singing like a bar song
the strangers pretty face that hits you like a car bomb
the wrinkled note we passed in class in second grade
and all it says up on the page

because my grandma lived to ninetynine eleven months
between a hundred years of solitude and heaven once
because she loved her son but couldnt ever say it right
because the language of the planet isnt day and night
its in the in between its when we intervene
and never let a silly hater rabbit pimp the scene
for the deaf kid in the aisle of the symphony
who hears it through the rumble of the tuba and the timpani
for those lay waste to beauty with a straight face
everywhere on earth were all escaping from the same place
and yes occasionally we get drunk and out of line
last night theres a lamp post that i asked to be my valentine
take a shady place shine until it radiates
detroit is equal till theres half its people laid off
while corporate lawyers and former employers play golf
because of furor over every juror paid off
and because the führer used to be a boy named adolf
because of anakin instead of panickin
and because of every man who can be more than just a mannequin
because of tienanmen because there was a cameraman
and because of the cameraman chasing princess diana and
because of tammany hall because of gramercy park
because of amityville and because of amnesty
because of famine and because its not a fantasy
because of every tenement into family
tentative to say cause of combs cause of hannity
homes for humanity the bones of my ancestry
grown and gone on gravestones and drawn on payphones and palms
raised up in alms


f f f f fuck an emcee name
i dont need a goddamn emcee name
i got nothing to hide you got something to say

if i go spit a poem if i go kick a flow
doesnt really matter man cause the jam is a watsky
when i get a mic and i go rip a rhythm aint a name in the whole damn game gonna stop me
probably gonna rip it too
cause the city wants a hippy with a bit to prove
i got shit to do i got the sickest crew
and so what the fuck is it to you dude
if i got no stage name i got stage game out the ass
and a master plan its an avalanche
when i spit a little bit of slam
and i hit you with the battleram
got a cattle brand gw bar none so what do you park man
got money and cars damn i study the stars
and i couldnt care less who you rep in your set show respect
ill be rapping i bet
lean to the left flow right oh my god
a rose by any name got thorns as sharp
yo stage names are for porno stars
and watskeet skeet skeet skeet is far
from what im trying to do who im trying to be
mother f f f fuck this industry
if i gotta be mc u to do mc me
georgewatskympthree
f f f f fuck the limit i got a keep it coming if i wanna make it to the top
cause i be giving you what i been doing during the minutes that other rappers have been napping on the clock
cause if i walk the walk and i talk the talk and im popping off cause my flow is hot
then im pretty motherfucking positive i never gotta try to be somebody im not


whats in a name man flow comes first
im never gonna cursethat i got it worst when i roam the earth
its a ridiculous coincidence that shows my worth
you know my parents went and chose my emcee name at birth
i dont need a mask to cover my ass
so why would you ask go put me on blast
ill take you to task
this name is my last  so put it on my tombstone when i pass
here lies a fine emcee the kind who grasps the fact
that these arent circus acts to make you clap its rap to make you think and act
i think you understand by now the thought involved
that if i wanted to be called another name i would have scrawled it on the bathroom wall
im not apologizing for a policy that makes a college kid go call himself thugdog and not expect assault
im marching on and calling all dissenters who
would like to be included in this emcee designation coup
im set to get a crew
were gonna get a clue and then well put it up for you to view
coo coo ca choo i am the insert you
come on everybody do it too


i invoke the spirits of the great nameless professional athletes turned rappers who came before me
deion sanders
roy jones jr
shaquille oneal

i invoke the spirits of the great nameless white emcees who came before me
fred durst
aaron carter
kevin federline
omm


i dont need a goddamn emcee name


then im pretty motherfucking positive i never gotta call myself somebody im not


when i look at whos around
and it feels like twos a crowd
i dont run and hide
i just smile real wide
and i turn my music loud

its not practical to react to bull
i was thinking too hard and i cracked my skull
its natural erase all doubt
if i take my phones off then my brains fall out
so you can shout empty out your throat on me
it just looks like youre lip synching obla di
obla da every time you go blah blah
blah im hearing life goes on like its your mantra
so talk shit but when its prone to go down
youre afraid of your own bull like rodeo clowns
i stay low to the ground i stay plugged in
and when my dome needs love phones hug my skin
but earbuds dont count theyre headphone loopholes
i want em bigger than a couple sideways soup bowls
and if youre sayin next to nothing
make like my playlist and get to shufflin


the frog in my throat was the size of a mutt
the fat toad ate the butterflies in my gut
the dog in me knows that its a bitch in dark black
so i spit the frog out and i took my bark back
till that id been afraid of night
my cradle never stayed in sight
it might have all abated if i played it right
i hated tryna find and face a place i didnt dare go
diving with the worms and liking looking like a scarecrow
do a mellow jig instead of tripping off a dollar
ill just skip the yellow brick with wicker sticking out my collar
its all or nothing ill be cultured when im older
fuck a parrot i dont care ill feed the vulture on my shoulder
try the lake for fish
yeah
i used to consider the riches and the props
and the houses and the fame and the fortune everything
seems when you get here there seems more desirable
all that old fear  doesnt leave its inside of you
everything material it passes like the nightll do
into day
came and went away
mental states annoyed with a attitude of zero gratitude that may destroy
beneath the lies is truth though
you seek and find the proof
only place to be is here
dig in peep it how the roots grow
from out of nowhere into nothingness and back
constantly expresses everything and everyone
and acting as a thread
arm leg leg arm head
karma that you spread
may be relived again after you live again after youre dead
until you merge into the blissful field of mighty power
but time is an illusion all of its within you now


yeah maybe i think about you sometimes
yeah maybe i think youre pretty alright
yeah maybe itd be decent if we linked up
fuck am i crazy just for dreaming of you all night
i scroll through every picture that you took so what
i picture how our kids would look so what
i drew a picture of us in my notebook so what
so what i wrote a song about you lets not go nuts

whatever i gotta do to heal the pain
whatever i gotta do so you feel the same
i guess id prolly do like all the above
if you love me and each night youd call me
and wed talk on the phone and be all like whatever
cause yeah dreamin of yous an all night endeavor
and yeah itd be chill to spend our lives together
whatever whatever never mind if its an effort


youve got knives in your broken heart
im outside in my go kart
so cut your last pair
and put up your black hair in a bun
and come fast we can run like mascara
you got force like joan of arc
and he falls short like bonaparte
and you deserve greater i know im no savior
but im here right now so lets go
kinda feels like weve been running every day of our lives
and shattering hearts and havin ours cracked
but if you went and threw the broken hearts in a pile
and added the stack then what do you have
you in the black deep in the red
if youre in your bed then you should come meet me instead
and out of the misery you know youve got a friend
said you got me
they want us movin at the speed of light but we wont hurry
lets hit the city and stay out so late that it gets early
like early on when we were livin on the cheapest thrills
because the town we fell in love with has the steepest hills
but those downs rebound to ups
tried to push dads coupe and torch the clutch
and they built us with extra gears and our cars run on exs tears
last night i realized im still sleepin on my mattress edge
saving room for someone whos not coming back to bed
but if we meet i got room here in the shotgun seat
but if youd rather take the keys please ill put up my feet
we pay taxes we live frugal
wear new suits to old friends funerals
have true loves until theyre false


hello hello hello hello
its a motherfuckin pleasure
no pressure but would you like to blow my mind
and move too fast and plan our perfect lives together
holy holy holy holy  you mean to tell me tell me tell 
youre tough to love when you dont love yourself well

my less exciting features are packed inside my body
theyre crammed into the balcony theyre jamming up the lobby
theyre falling out the window
you can see them crashing through the glass
when i dont keep my lids closed as the director flicks his wrist
the stagehand in the wing has got a silver chain he grips it
when he lifts it opens up the velvet curtains of my lips
and i say

were not looking to wish on a star
were no good at receiving the help
who the hell do you think that you are
tryna make me believe in myself
youre like the sun in the summertime
i know you are but what am i
i dont really wanna sound like a lullaby
but i think every family is a butterfly
you know pretty from afar pretty gross up close
dont pity what we are its mostly unhideous
and im sitting at the bar with a beer
so cheers come toast me
get cozy since were both lonely
why dont we leap and then go see
what we become when its done its done
but im not looking below so dont ghost me
and its seeming like were in agreement
that the demon that were fighting isnt the exact same
but if were teaming up and carrying the weight together
we can miss a bit of back pain
and if youre into it then we can get up out the city
in a minute in the fast lane
get hitched in a chapel in vegas
maybe get rich life is a craps game
and i take my cue from you
on what you wanna do bout a last name
its not so bad to be a watsky

those fires in your attic that rage without permission


theres something wrong with her
theres something wrong with me
i dont think thats so wrong we came by it honestly
and honestly i think mostly everybody does
i dont blame you if you need to catch a buzz
ive built so much armor but ring the alarm
im in love with someone whos bringing me harm
ill pick lovers who got monsters and we bond on mental health
til they remind me of whats ugly in myself

im always on the brink
about to fly or sink
a minion with opinions told me that i shouldnt think so hard
that shit just made me think so hard i couldnt sleep a wink
washed my red flags with my white flags and now all my laundrys pink
im petty at best someone to pity at worst
putty in beautiful hands potty mouth ready to curse
cursed to be curious if all this is a scam
and i had to google narcissist to check if thats what i am

either you get nothing
but they make you pay and pay
or you get it till they take it all away
every day every day
it amazes me a hundred brand new faces
but im still trying to figure out who they is shi 
i dont wanna settle one bit
bet that im gonna battle for somebody but if
i look at what we got and catch rot
then im gonna come in with a hatchet and i cut it down quick
cut around rust cut around mold
everybody ends up cold
heads gotta roll thats life
and you gotta be the neck or the knife
but im told that i cant quite quit this
constant itch to matter my restless drive to win
thats driving me that drove away the closest of my kin
how i twist away when deep relationships begin
and shit theres still the biness of the thinness of my skin
im vain im lame im strange and yet so typical
i make the same mistakes i dont change shit and still
my folks age and age i hate to face facts
and i feel i wear their faces as a mask


if you tell me im the one
while were lying in the sun
would you sign it on a piece of paper
do you know what youre about
could we live beyond our doubts
in a world where we dont need erasers
could you ever love a thief
can i steal away your grief
and suspend your disbelief
lets put on a show
cause its never what you say
no its always in the way
that you say what you mean
oh oh oh
wrap your legs around my back
and hold me tight until were talkin in tongues
then when we pass the spirit
we can yell forever at the top of our lungs

dont sweat the goons
all we do is crack a smile
when we hear em callin
you should go get a room
ever stop to think the pollen in the air
is from all the flowers fuckin each other
but why not let them bloom
lets get consumed
outside outside outside
inside o you
so forget me not
were doin trust falls
up at the mountaintop
cmon dont let me drop
now that weve found a spot
and when we swung high on the pendulum
we just hung there in the sky


you wanna brawl and crawl back into bed
but i cant move at all im stalled and in my head
im out here playin dead we are not fit to duel
our parents gave us different pistols taught us different rules
your father was cruel this man you resent
is despite your best intentions what i represent
i say it isnt right you say you want whats right
be prepared to fight

its sick the way we fight and spit
somehow we find each other even when were trying to quit
cause right behind our shit we like each other quite a bit
but i might admit its pitiful the way the line was split
a hundred thousand years and were still trying to find the clit
but we dont have an ending yet we get to write the script
it isnt gonna do to move our lips we prove it with the chips


you say its your thing to be honest
like its kind of this token of pride
well to be honest youre kind of a goddess
but being with you kind of kills me inside
you want me to explain it well
its sort of this look in your eye
like youre cooking an egg on the hood of your car cause you looked at it hard
but my heart is the egg and youre watching it fry
im not gonna cry im not gonna lie i am gonna cry
but not right here
give me like a minute let me get up in my feelings while i pop my beer
shit is getting muddy and im seeking out the buddy
at the bottom of the bottle but its not quite clear
what you expect from me
when youre disrespecting me

wanna treat me like a dog on a leash
well thats your prerogative sheesh
or does she wanna see what we got
when the saga repeats nada capeesh
im not a complete wretch
i fetch i sit a bit but im not gonna stay
but if you wanna see me you can see my feets
and my cute little cheeks when im walkin away
you can see me sitting on the dock at the bay
you can see me lickin on my crotch like a stray
but if youre gonna see me like a prop in a play
gotta say ill be skippin what you got for the day
maybe youll be thinking that im hot in the head
or im sick of pickin at my chicken pox in the bed
you can think what you like i think ill take a hike


wanna crash in slow mo
repeat our patterns and blow oh no
im all plaid youre all mad
the amateur saboteurs bout to go pro
what i know is that the people arent runnin the show
any minute to another they come and they go
and they never gonna get what the government owe
so do what you gotta to pick up enough of the dough
i dont see the benefit of us comin to blows
give it a second honey i bet ill be stubbin my toe
what we got doesnt come by a lot
so we shoot every shot to work it out
but im dumb in love out of touch
is it too much or not enough

wanna burn the house down
pack up and get outta town
drive without turning around
arrive ridin the waves and hold hands while we drown
aint no limit never heard of high ceilings
never timid its a certified g thing
even after getting thirty five bee stings
still the motherfucker wouldnt hurt a flys feelings
but being nice is sometimes not so nice
its not so nice no no
got dropped didnt stop
i was caught up in my life like
hey batter batter hey batter batter
hey better suck it up buttercup
bottom of the ninth look sharp
i was lookin out for love and i puckered up
better buckle up cause i fuck it up again and again
and im sick of picking up my stupid ass heart each time


yeah maybe i think about you sometimes
yeah maybe i think youre pretty alright
yeah maybe itd be decent if we linked up
fuck am i crazy just for dreaming of you all night
i scroll through every picture that you took so what
i picture how our kids would look so what
i drew a picture of us in my notebook so what
so what i wrote a song about you lets not go nuts

whatever i gotta do to heal the pain
whatever i gotta do so you feel the same
i guess id prolly do like all the above
if you love me and each night youd call me
and wed talk on the phone and be all like whatever
cause yeah dreamin of yous an all night endeavor
and yeah itd be chill to spend our lives together

when them other niggas didnt

anybody could get it
hospital or ditches
bicycles or fences
layin low with intentions
of coming out up out the trenches surrender
cant see it or witness
cant be it i see it
at the same time
but i cant speak it
nightmares from the night air
stares and a groan slight
glare from the right flare
tears in the bone
two bottles few models
pair of patron
and the drum roll sound
like snares when its on


i hurt so much in the last month
live everyday like its your last one
cant trust nobody
ive been betrayed by everybody around
cracking jokes i dont laugh much
for help i never could ask much
if im down an out i get passed up

this life is like a rodeo
up and down emotional roller coaster
problem solving aint hard to cope with
but its hard to follow rules im the culprit
easy to talk but its hard to listen
but the goal im chasing aint hard to picture
hurt to see every car i wanted
but behind the wheel i aint the person in it
the chick i wanted wanted someone popular

i hear it in the prophecy cant come down
it grows in my heart not knowin where it goes
search through pain ah
and the wishes with the rain ah
i seem to deny all that blinding light
that only glows to those that really cant run
on just who they are its clear as can be
no need to lie into your emerald soul
you usually know gold is always in your glow
why not let it shine ah
hey youre in control of the dream


uh i know you still think about me
i could tell he knows he probably saudy
no more dodging this shit the cat and mouse
finding love in the shadows ready to pounce
they yearning for my return
laying next to him you daydreaming of my meat
you remember when i said put it on my face
damn girl when will you learn theres no escaping me
passion never dissipates no soul without your mate relate
man i couldve never fathomed
hate you mingling with these corny niggas though i dont care how it happened
its cool now cause im home
sloppiest sex the best way were both giving dome
im so through with him she says
i hate her he says
the makeup sex is electric
he smiles her gazes
her sun on gray weeks
translates her heartbeat
my legs shakin she says
he grabs the back of her neck
and they live a little mm
and they live a little
give a little

the curse of once dating an awesome nigga
cant duck my energy ever
such a curse is a curse if you make it so
which means we in control until forever
so stop wasting your fucking chi
stop searching chasing your tail
running in circles to no destination
remember we once saved each other from hell
im never tryna persuade
you gotta figure what you want in you
ill be clear im a hell of a man
flaws and all somebody would love to have me too
but you can tell im bored with these hoes
sex is weak when there isnt a glow

wonder what them folks on thats what they be askin
dumb kush we smokes on smell it when a nigga passin
we gettin to the cash and you can see a nigga shinin
just a little gold a couple hoes couple two three diamonds
up in the hood where you find him unless he out on the road
every show got a bag full of blow and patron
all my niggas getting throwed like they posed to
cause life is short and filled with lots of grief and doubt
so i just pull that bag of colorful frosty leaves on out
and free my scalp i need to free my mind a puff at a time
im up all the time im up on the grind
so a red bull and a blunt would be fine
just wanna feel fine just wanna kill time
just wanna relax and think of a rhyme
dont really like sippin cause i get to trippin
my nigga just roll up a heap of that pine
and only bring a little bit for the trip
just in case we get blurped by five point zero
sir you look high i know but i prefer my eyes low

yeah they say easy friend
there he go talking about weed again
probably cause of all that weed in him yes and no
cause and effect is what most dont know
doing bad or like mike said could be doing wrong
forget about the obvious context of song
put your brain where it belong
cant we just all get a bong and tag along
and we float we kids with hope
better to cope when you smoke
dawg please dont miss
what a nigga tryna get you thinking bout
we outside because my mama in the house
puff puff pass with your bitch ass
back in high school smoked weed when i cut class
and now im an addict tragic
stay rolling up while reclining
i be looking down see my jesus piece shining
good look yeezy now i stay blinded by that light
somebody pass me that shell to the right
yes im going ill be outtie and you can find me
ill be chilling back ill be chilling jack
lets go


simple as that for your simple ass

im dreaming on good for a sicker plan
sicker than any other nigga could be thinking and
i cant be a loser couldve figured that
i cant be a lame im cooler than that
i feel i love the fame then i hate it back hmm
thinking now what i should be twitterin
whyd big bro take all the hot bitches
dear god me too i like the hot bitches
ill be the underdog all along til im gone
i will live through a song ill be strong through the haters

uh simple as that for your simple ass
simple way i wish you wouldve called it how it shouldve been
they try to tell me they dont get it they dont underdig
now ill be damned i came this far to let a fool live
i gotta terminate the hate spread the positive
without it being wack and cheesy to the little kids
so i curse like a sailor and i smoke weed
i am exactly who an older rappers kids be
long as the booty lookin juicy and he stylin on em

as our hero seems to be dreaming in peace
a dark chapter unfolds
throwing scott into the most eerie
and unstable part of his imagination
so intense he cannot tell his dreams from reality
this is the rise of the night terrors


knock knock cudi open up its chip
gotta kush pack shells and some henney we could sip
keep a couple dollas on give a penny to a bitch
but im wit a couple hos who said they really wanna get
acquainted with some niggas who aint the average niggas
they just wanna see why all they girlfriends be wanting pictures
i be flyer then a hundred gnats worth a hundred hundred stacks
i aint gonna stop shoppin till i hit a hundred sacks
polo thats a given i aint even gotta mention
candy old school put you niggas in detention
slabbed niggas deeped up tool in the clothes
im just a young fresh fly fool with some gold

oh i rearrange faces when i drop
im super duper cudi candy paint the rag top
cant nobody even tell me i dont sip em when i lean
but get me to my fans im country to the seas
please i stay up on my creep so to come up
gotta look the part superstar no stunnas
ima say some shit that make you think i lost my mind
im the only nigga that could watch the sun and dont go blind
she fine as she wanna be but she wanna check though
dodging and popping pictures like the hos was working with the law
back in shaker bitches trynna play me to the left
now i pick the hoes that i want and give my niggas what is left
i dont know if its the name or the bape gum bottoms
keep them on salute them five point ones you cant knock em
use to have the honda with the thirty day tags
that was in the past now im bout to throw em on the jag


what a world that im living in
will the rainstorms ever end
still i feel my
path narrow i run again
seem happiness is gone again
and then you see em
grey clouds up above man
metaphoric to my life man
heart stronger than its ever been
strong will til my journey ends
until then i roll
more than i ever rolled
not pills but the mary though
eyes heavy when the day goes
nothing helping when my head doze
but i aint sleep
awake in another state
living in a new space
mind running at a steady pace
god help me so ill win the race
until then i go

grey clouds stuck together fam
lightning piercing through another land
over the desert where the lost play
soul searching each and every way
and then you see the
awesome sound so profound
when it  itll grip you
you can see it
if you hear it you can feel it too
something special i am running to
away very far away
where all the people say
its the new new place
for the special to embrace
like a martian who seemingly
wandered out of place
take what you need
from the valley of the hope where
even if you drown
youll be floating higher up and
you can say bye bye bye
sky might be falling
but remember you can fly high


off jump boo cudi give you funk
hit you in your head then it work it to your rump
hatin niggas cant hate leave em all stumped
they gotta like a nigga call me obama
not a hypebeast while you beast for the hype
yeah im the underdog story of my life
matter fact i dreamed that i lived twice
once as a slave who imagined being free
and made it all happen for his family and his seed
and now me you can call me mr friendly
one life to live but no acting on my nigga friendy
cant stand evil bitches with they fendi
all they do is envy and plot up on my loins
i give you options baby flip a coin
you get mcdonalds forget the sirloin
hating my macking they asking

folarin the muse of the hater
that music is greater stupid nigga bring your face up
bamas surprised deprived from attention
pride of the district all rise so they listenin
from where gorillas territorial for inches
when it come to pistols these niggas dont john lynch them
off rip thats genius
you niggas so so like seamstress
no more amore i refuse to force you
maybe i lack the fortitude to try to court you
of course they all hate
early adapters agree they all late
so what that say about my watch
to yall minds im like a uk clock
hours ahead so wack niggas is sayin
what they sayin young
they sayin
they sayin

i was born to do the damn thing
story of cudi nigga getting out my dreams
zero options to choose
living in a box full of cuyahoga blues and listen
i stayed away from reading the plain dealer
most of my niggas back in cleveland were plain dealers uh
who whipped supremes the candy painted eyes
but the love from the boppers had him watchin they rise
wasnt no love for a nigga in the smug
sipping out a cup a concoction for cruising
high off life my nigga not even
imma go to war with the devil til were even
bobbing and weaving spiritual hymn singing
no commentary my man i come out swinging
and this will be the song that we sing
any young nigga with visions when hes sleeping


soarin is this allowed
i sure bet my daddy proud
a little nigga with a shaker smile
on top of the dreams is where im found
some figured i was satan bound
until i came back with a style i found
then all of a sudden they fixed their faces
cause of who i know and the trail of places
that ive stepped
how many niggas wanna hate cause i left
how could you blame me and my plan of attack
cause im risking my soul intact
now im heard all over the map
only rule of thumb 
it dont really matter just where you from
all that really matter is where you gon go
maybe upstate for some
but you cant rule out these cats for gone
second chances given out for some
all you gotta do is take advantage
then maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage
done pimpin you can think about marriage
until then get it
then find yourself and lets begin
ima tell you how in a minute
ima show you how i be livin
from a long time ago a young nigga he was timid
now im zoned see things so vivid
hide my soul nah homie not even
ima zone out til i lose feeling remember
ima be gone way past november
even stay up there up there
floatin floatin hopin
i can find peace somewhere

ballin is this allowed
without feelin like shallow hal
diamonds on the jesus piece for style
back in cleveland city we ride around
greetin my niggas with dap and pound
so if i fall i wont hit the ground
these are the things thatll make me smile
knowin this blunt might burn a while
i keep myself so lifted
i am accustomed to new heights
i feel perfect though they think its worthless
see without my flight man
everybody wanna be a critic
i have my life and i will live it
shut your mouth before i fuck it
ha my jokes they will love it
if im seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans
more than likely i am faded man
you are not the shit if everywhere you go
niggas aint sitting standing round hating so
my vice is  when the lights start flashin
ill be zonin all alone then
and the place where my mind is goin
filled with songs that no ones knowin
and the devil in a hot pink dress
tryna ask me for one dance
he think he slick
but my guardians protect me from his wrath
so in my place no hate shall enter
livin high up there up there
copin copin floatin
i will find peace somewhere


they cant comprehend
or even come close to understanding him
i guess if i was boring they would love me more
guess if i was simple in the mind
everything would be fine
maybe if i was a jerk to girls
close my eyes hide in the dark
its a curtain call come one come all
all i do is try to make it simple
the ones that make it complicated
never get congratulated
im something different all aspects
dont want a woman just to love her assets
ill still wife her up even with her flat chest
the type to get hurt but thats the past tense


little homie in the room
in in the room boy on the moon
 no one to hang out with
talk that shit to just my little homies
one year younger they aint get where i was going
took a turn to the worse when my father left me lonely
lonely in my room
i i mean me up on the moon
entertained myself laughed at myself
as i grew to be a teen i disguised myself
had the lowest self esteem especially with the girls
tried every sport just to impress all the girls
instead of all the ladies cause they talk down
i was too artsy known to be a clown
and now my facebook proper
cause i told the same girls i would be the hot shit
one day

big homie made the move
made made the move flew off the moon
still  no one to hang out with
talk that shit to just my brooklyn niggas
all i would wonder is when will my time come
had mad jobs and i lost damn near all of them
think about my bosses yep i hated all of them
studio at night had me hustlin to most of them
nigga i was late damn near every day
but ima be on time when my stars align
when my soul was happy on my ramen diet
followed by a loosey was the meal of grinders
if you knowin the truth all you think about is that thing
always be a hater tryna shoot down any dream
until you meet a kid like k i
niggas thought i was crazy my mama know i stay high
were getting money mom


i got ninetynine problems and they all bitches
wish i was jigga man carefree livin
but im not shawn or martin louis
im that cleveland nigga rollin with them brooklyn boys
you knowin how it be when you start living large
i control my own life charles was never in charge
no sitcom could teach scott about the dram
or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
on christmas time my mom christmas grind
got me most of what i wanted howd you do it mom huh
she copped the toys i would play with in my room by myself
why he by himself
he got two older brothers one hood one good
an independent older sister kept me fly when she could
but they all didnt see
the little bit of sadness in me
scotty

im super paranoid like a sixth sense
since my father died i aint been right since
i try and think about myself as a sacrifice
just to show the kids they aint the only ones who up at night
the moon will illuminate my room and soon im consumed by my doom
once upon a time nobody gave a fuck
its all said and done and my cocks been sucked
so now im in the cut alcohol in the wound
my hearts an open sore that i hope heals soon
i live in a cocoon opposite of cancún
where it is never sunny the dark side of the moon
so its more than right i try and shed some light on a man
not many people of this planet understand pain

im this close to go and trying some coke
and a happy ending would be slittin my throat
ignorance to cope man ignorance is bliss
ignorance is love and i need that shit
if i never did shows then id prolly be a myth
if i cared about the blogs then id prolly be a jackass
dont give a shit what people talkin bout fam
haters shake my hand but i keep the sanitizer on deck
hope i really get to see thirty
wanna settle down stop being so flirty
most of the clean faces be the most dirty
i just need a thoroughbred cook when im hungry
ass all chunky brain is insanity
only things that calm me down pussy and some cali tree
and i get both never truly satisfied
i am happy thats just the saddest lie


now when the sun come up
ill be there to say what up in the morning
brush my teeth
find that clip i been looking for since last night
i feel so caught up in the bud
i float somehow in my bedroom
turn around
see myself in the mirror i guess im cool
and those happy thoughts in my head
im feeling like im peter pan
minus the tights and the fairies
happy to see how far ive come
to the same place it began
my dreams and imagination
perfectly at peace
so i move along a bit higher

higher learnin
i see the dreams i made
so im cooler now
i can take care of my mom and my little niece zuri
so sing along lil mama
you aint gotta worry bout no drama no
i provide for friends and fam and fans
and cleveland city grinding man
stay afloat
the key is hope
the end is never the end
a new challenge awaits
a test no man could be prepared for
a new hell he must conquer and destroy
a new level of growth he must confront himself
the machine and the ghost within
this is the journey of the man on the moon

how strange the notion
you dont really know no one
and what if i told you
you no longer know me

hard times they mold you
into someone way colder

hope i dont live to grow old no one at home
staring at myself in the mirror take one to know one
want to find out bout the real me
certain moments reveal you
especially friends who were never good friends
but want to act like they know me
you better keep going and keep on strolling
its so crazy how you think you can play me

hard times they mold you
to the haters i told you

but they never change bought a set of chains with another chain
upgraded to a better chain that beretta sing i aint playing
shoes on the rari start to look like hooves
pigs by the crib start to look like wolves
money neva change me only change the situation
the paper i be chasin got them sucka niggas hatin
started from the pavement basement satan
couldnt match my flames so they compare me to a mason
free like slaves but they based and crazy
we talkin bout crack or we talkin about blacks
spliffing the blunt up then they pickin the gun up
motherfuckers is trippin they fittin to run up
then they gettin the come up yup bitch
and they do it til the sun up
and this is for my niggas and my gang
through the fortune and the fame
only thing that never change is my niggas

i got the niggas that i need with me

have you ever felt
something evil
lurking around
the moon is full
the streets are empty
shadows cover the town
you cant call it
you cant shake the feeling
quiet do not make a sound
but the wind seems to speak
somethings here in the room with me


my brother told me a long time ago
dont focus where you been g focus where you tryna go
i swear the game make you cold like abominable snowman
old man when you trying to shine like gold
when its my time to blow partner imma know
in the midst of getting dough i was hit with highs and lows
my melo tried to play me like my fucking eyes was closed
now im sittin here wishing that my guys didnt know
they love a g so they despise a soul
what they gon do to him beyond my control
when the reaper calls its your time to go
never play a nigga when you see that he is trying to grow
im benny blanco when he knocked out carlito
and pachanga so im watching every angle
under the moonlight with the devil ive tangoed
church on the move like jesus in the manger
better control the money its better to control the anger
so now i watch a friend the way that i watch a stranger

chilling rolling up something to change my feeling
thinkin about how i came up from nothing while im
splitting this cigarillo phone rings i get a call
one of my dogs tripping hard talkin about really killin them all
i say slow down slow down what the fuck you mean nigga
just ran to your crib and popped your daughter in the spleen
ill be there in twenty minutes but it only took fifteen
we wasnt that tight but cool enough for me to hit the scene
not knowing this was all a set up secretly they want me wet up
jealous of my future cheddar however
they fastest move was too slow for me
i pulled up wasnt no ambulance there wasnt no police
something fishy going on naive kept pressing on
nine gripped thinking the killer could still be on the lawn
opened the front door they shot i shot some abrupt shit
the nigga with something to lose almost lost it
wont trust him again

cheese came through at three
salute at ease c had supplied the weed
cause ibn had odd
its me with a black rockstar steez
real rock tees three point zero a pop for these
please bummy you dont know me money
day  nite got flipped and i got blow for a grip
sipping on a heinie with my jamie boo besides me
thats my fucking best friend
when im tweaking she be calming a brother
like the touch from a mother
i am so damn comfortable i never want to leave it
the feeling is something like a spiritual healer
that could end me i think thats the part i find intriguing
a little bit off i am i am i am
i see that im caught i am i am i am
its something like a spiritual healer that could end me
i think thats the part i find intriguing im fiending


birds sing flying around
you never see them too long on the ground
you want to be one of them
you might hear the birds singing flying around

knocked down round for round
youre feeling like youre shot down on the ground
when will the fantasy end
when will the heaven begin
you might be knocked down round for round

thirtyone
scott scott scott scott
thats good you alright


shades over my eyes
make the creepers look back at themselves
sittin stuck in emotional bliss
the skinny model girls rub coke on their gums
tap my knee im keepin the rhythm
the young and wild take chances together
they all jump up twist and groove
but no one talks lost in the motherfuckin mood

theres a hunger in the night
the moonlight kissing the nips on a model frame
i kissed her inner thigh
closed my eyes she began to make me fish
she like to go the mile
all the while i could see her tear a bit
i forgot her name somethin that sound like penelope
maybe a french twang to it
her tongue was quick she was french i knew it
a lovely foreigner foreign to racism
she like that young nigga vibe
my brown skin my shagged out fro
im king to her and she will please her friend for me
so funny how the starvin are guardless
naked is always honest
her hands all over my privates lost in the mood


yeah the crazy the wizard
so much whiskey all in my liver
i really like the punch it delivers
makes me warm while i high five sinners
all alone trying to hide from the shadows
aint no use it seems everywhere they follow
they know where i be at
infect my mind tryna get me

yeah the rager the menace
hate me now then hate me when im winning
work so hard to not go insane
its a full time job to not lose my faith
okay ive been here before
alone for the umpteenth time or more
im tired of motherfuckers saying that they worry about me
when in fact they probably never gave a fuck about me


when the days change
so does my attitude
im messy at home
i eat a lot of junk food
when the nights change
so do my nightmares too
i dream reality
is my dream

when the weeks change
the rumors change too
im addicted to highs
would you like to know why
when the months change
so do my love point of views
i dont want what i need
what i need hates me


liquor all night love it
untamed youth the coupes moves like bullets
i guess the fact my father smoked and drank
made it a young nigga destiny to do the exact same
young wildn all me and my codys
watch the phonies and hoes that claim they blew me
dark skin china doll with the fake tits
ice grillin my spanish chick word
we all in together now we off it
cops be buggin shotguns on the whip
fuck em i would never sweat for a piggie
you can catch me high its all good no biggie

four in the morning gettin cozy
so much goose i let the fries soak it up some
tuesday weekly the legend of the rager
most have witnessed the cud in the club
we dont have plain pat ready
ice is thrown and the whole crew gone
done off for better and very celebratory
fuck the blogs ima tell my story
no matter the phase my name is engraved
in the minds of the youngins who be livin to they graves
you live and you learn
doing bumps in the day and keep blunts to burn

rage cause im paid
take the grey and create another shade
awesome no more bitches playin possum
pop and lock em and send em on home
tired of hoes all they want is to get chose
know the code want a woman with some toes
optimos takin trips to australia
do some blow and hope you make it through the show
hands high
go with your soul and try floatin through the sky
hide the pain with some pussy and mimosas
costa rica next on the agenda


i am the maniac i am the ghoul
im in the shadows in the corner of my room
this my new hideaway this is my tomb
this is my coffin this is my place for unruliness no worries
i love the darkness yeah id like to marry it
it is my cloak it is my shield it is my cape
i love the dark maybe we can make it darker
give me a marker

i am the maniac i am the fool
i found a monster in me when i lost my cool
it lives inside of me eating whats in its way
i put black spray paint on my windows during the day
i want to spend time with it i think im losing it
or i found it and im using it
i wear my shades at night so i can look in the abyss
i see something in nothingness if you can picture this
put black holes in my jar lid i climb the wall
im too high now ill die from the fall
before the waters to our knees we cant climb when the trees
wash away you and i are the disease


pain hurt sadness and loneliness
balled all that shit right up
tossed it away to the bottomless pit
the part of my mind that slips
and the part of my mind so sick
i dont even like to take the trip unless im sloppy drunk
i pray for my mom how to teach had a son
that never gave a fuck about a scantron
all i wanted was to be a human being
and show all the world some new colors and scenes
imagine all types of beautiful scenery
i remember when i first had trees
smoked out a black and mild so dumb of me
now im grape cigarillo man
any young black kid guaranteed fan
hold it down humble pie on the humble
and i treat normal girls like models
reckless and young and my my moms calling
think i should hit decline
im numb faced while im thinking bout suicide

black robin hood riding high just like we should
you know the saying aint no delaying
gotta gets the getting while the gettings good
yeah demented my brain was forced to transform
wise up im checking the gate
on humble tales and minimum wage
the blogs tell it cudis lame
wearing a kilt he must be gay
lets keep it trill fuck being discreet
bet some girls tweet how they miss my meat
yeah cudders hbo that vitamin water
thats money to blow cause its money for blow
dont take no shit you can blame my ma
im in the maze im in a daze im losing it
im locking in my rocketship
ill be a blip on your radar bitch
feels like things can be covered
until the day im above myself hovered


what up how is everyone doing
you are now in the world i am ruling
take a minute to adjust for the wondrous
clusterfuck of fun and enchantment
i promise you some generation next shit
speak for the seller who i left with
parallel levels in the dark dark place
tricked all you niggas to a dark dark fate
and guided you all with a smile upon my face
as the sun kisses us on the foreheads gently
gentle with the drugs heavy with the love
and my speeches on stage rock mountains from a club
money doesnt move me except on the literal
gfour flights now were off to australia
i wanna see more of the world
these are more than just words
these are facts from a winner

what up how is everyone feeling
i hope you understand what youre hearing
take a minute to roll up for the wondrous
clusterfuck of darkness and evil
i will paint the yin and the yang for you
and my jeans are dior for the love of skinnies
upgraded fitted it into the t
work hard making sure i dont become a memory
hard to press on when the memories remember me
and they always find the perfect moment
high speed my momentum wont slow up none
lost in the wind ive lost all my friends
maybe they were never meant to be acquainted
money seems to make everything tainted
everybody mad cause they stuck where i knew em last
took what i wanted and i did it all blunted
oh oh


they done let in the skinny jean wearing
fro for days in an old aa
ballin so low most fools couldnt price me
silently stunt with a blunt full of pe
and i guess you know me
been in ny so long got tri state family
especially brooklyn shout out to the madis
my bloodline runs deep
nights i dont sleep figure its my pops keeping me awake
help me keep my mind out the clouds for reality
these motherfuckers cant fathom the wizardry
slow mo brain ass backwards cowards
take a shower your attitude stinks
want to know what i think

i live through words not metaphors
so i passed to be the rest of the freshmen
playful tough talk often the fave
til i came like pac art and said true things
a whole new legion of some niggas
aiming high passed the idea of slanging
praise allah for keeping me away man
a lot of my niggas fell victim to the dope game
some things will never be same
wish that i could tell my brother
something for some motivation to get him out that gutter
hes leaving behind a family and a mother
damn you must understand
what i speak about in song this how i really am
yeah this is how i really think
you can see what i see yes i really blink
yes i really drink i really do rage
my demons out the cage bout most of the day
before i became the age to even rage
i was drowning my sorrows with some oe nigga
hey we live this shit


you see im trapped in my mind oh im goin trippy

you said we do this to death
cold until my last breath slowly exhale
one last fuck you to the world


emotional slave slut
she push and pulls uses me for what she needs
just an emotional slave slut
been tossed aside like rotten meat
while the maggots and vultures feast
feasting on my memories
everyones searching for lightning
hold up a box of recycling

been tossed aside like rotting meat
i cant wait to be rotting meat
everyone searching for lightning
right in plain sight you deny him


no doubt about it im melting ooh melting
world full of wonder if you open those eyes
shed yourself get out the disguise
slow mo we all want acceptance
truth fuck that get off that
accept truth be free and carry on baby
hey

no doubt about it im crumbling ooh crumbling
no issue i got it x ray through the lies
to enter the void got to lose more of your mind
it happens the same old downward spiral
and i weep to sleep give it all ive got in the morning
so good night my baby
instant pain hey


cuts and burns cuts and burns
my turn shove it your fake concern
the lesson is served a lesson is learned
so much avoiding memories fading
this shit is so weak so weak
suddenly suddenly

nothing left theres nothing left
your turn shove it your fake concern
fractured emotion zero devotion
the elements fading remains remaining
oh this is so us this is so us
unfortunately


ive been trying to steer been trying to steer it right
its fairly clear how i might be screwed
the end is near said the end is nearing
its fairly clear we might be screwed
when life loses appeal when the ghosts appear
just a kid in the moonlight just a kid in the moonlight
headlights on a deer headlights on the fear
just a kid in the moonlight


wait
momma told me wait
i can not relate
eat whats on your plate
fill yourself with hate
take her on a date

looking in the mirror is hard
some days i hurt myself to distract me from distraction

go on adventures to find that the answers arent plain
but theres comfort in tears
decoding my sacred heart flying from here
no more falling apart ah

he has to have someone forever
for all of her nights for all of her days
for all of the wet sex and all of the ways

and what youll find is your highness

carolinas finest you knew that already
in terms of the greatest i proved that already
and if you would like i do it twice
i just sharpen my blade for a minute became lost in my ways
this for my niggas that was tossed in the graves
every so often i fade deep in my thoughts
and then get lost in the days
we used to play before your coffin was made
just got the call nigga got caught with a stray
hope hes okay
just got paid what cochran got paid to free oj
just to share my life on the stage in front of strangers
who know a nigga far too well and thats the danger
know me better than i know myself
i rip a page out my notebook in anger
and let these thoughts linger singing

whats the price for a black man life
i check the toe tag not one zero in sight
i turn the tv on not one hero in sight
unless he dribble or he fiddle with mics
look out the window cause tonight the city lit up with lights
cameras and action
may no man alive come through and damage my faction
i brought you niggas with me cause i  love you like my brothers
and your mothers like my mother
think we need a plan of action
the bigger we get the more likely egos collide its just physics
please lets put our egos aside you my niggas
and should our worst tendencies turn us into enemies
i hope that we remember these
nights fulla hennessey
when hov around we switch up to that dusse
gotta show respect one day we tryna stay where you stay
cause we from where you from
not talkin bout the slums
im talkin bout that mind state that keep a black nigga dumb
keep a black nigga dyin by a black nigga gun
and keep on listening to the frontin ass rap niggas son
yeah i said son
this is new yorks finest
for eleven winters straight i took on new yorks climate
like show me new yorks ladder
i climb it and set the bar so high that you gotta get obama to force the air force to find it
never mind it youll never reach that
cole is the hypnotist control the game whenever he snap
thats every track nigga

i aint serve no pies i aint slang no dope
i dont bring no lies niggas sang my quotes
i dont play no games boy i aint no joke
like the great rakim when i make my notes
you niggas might be l or you might be kane
or you might be slick rick with nineteen chains
or you might be drizzy drake or kendrick lamar
but check your birth date nigga you aint the god
nah you aint the god
nigga cole the god
january twentyeightth


no role models and im here right now
no role models to speak of
searchin through my memory my memory i couldnt find one
last night i was gettin my feet rubbed
by the baddest bitch not trina but i swear to god
this bitchll make you call your girl up
and tell her hey whats good
sorry im never comin home ima stay for good
then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
i came fast like nine point one one in white neighborhoods
aint got no shame bout it
she think im spoiled and im rich cause i can have any bitch
i got defensive and said nah i was the same without it
but then i thought back back to a better me
before i was a b list celebrity
before i started callin bitches bitches so heavily
back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody
you wasnt sweatin me

i want a real love dark skinned aunt viv love
that jada and that will love
that leave a toothbrush at your crib love
and you aint gotta wonder whether thats your kid love
nigga i dont want no bitch from reality shows
out of touch with reality hoes
out in hollywood bringin back five or six hoes
fuck em then we kick em to the do
nigga you know how it go
she deserved that she a bird its a bird trap
you think if i didnt rap she would flirt back
takin off her skirt let her wear my shirt fore she leave
ima need my shirt back

my only regret was too young for lisa bonet
my only regret was too young for nia long
now all im left with is hoes from reality shows
hand her a script the bitch probably couldnt read along
my only regret was too young for sade adu
my only regret could never take aaliyah home
now all im left with is hoes up in greystone
with the stale face cause they know its they song
she shallow but the pussy deep


aint a way around it no more i am the greatest
a lotta niggas sat on the throne i am the latest
i am the bravest go toe to toe with the giants
i aint afraid of you niggas ill end up fading you niggas
fore its all said and done this nigga need medicine
my uzi it weighed a ton i need me a better gun
in fact i just might need two cause niggas say they the one
and i got something to prove
forgive me lord here they come blaoow

my inhibitions fighting my intuition
premature premonition showing me the demolition
of these phony niggas so ahead of my time
even when i rhyme about the future i be reminiscing
you want the truth well come and listen
im like that time you bagged a dime and checked ya phone and saw it was a number missing
as fate passes you by half of you try
the other half of you fry too high to actually fly
one day yall have to decide who you gon be
a scary nigga or a nigga thats gon rule like me
keep it true like me cole you might be
like the new ice cube meets the new ice t
meets two live crew meets the new spike lee
meets bruce like wayne meets bruce like lee
meets two lil wayne in a new white tee
meets kd aint no nigga that can shoot like me
blaoow

listen
history repeats itself and thats just how it goes
same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
same thing that my nigga elvis did with rock n roll
justin timberlake eminem and then macklemore
while silly niggas argue over who gon snatch the crown
look around my nigga white people have snatched the sound
this year ill prolly go to the awards dappered down
watch iggy win a grammy as i try to crack a smile
im just playin but all good jokes contain true shit
same rope you climb up on theyll hang you with
but not jermaine my aim too sick
i bang nigga i came to bring the pain my brain too quick
you see how i maneuver this game i aint stupid
i recognize that life is a dream and i dream lucid
and fuck it if the shoe fits whos the king


this is my canvas
ima paint it how i want it baby oh i
ima paint it paint it paint it how i want it nigga
fuck you cause there there is no right or wrong only a song
i like to write alone be in my zone
think back to forest hills no perfect home
but the only thing like home ive ever known
until they snatched it from my mama
and foreclosed her on the loan
im so sorry that i left you there to deal with that alone
i was up in new york city chasing panties getting dome
had no clue what you was going through
how could you be so strong
and how could i be so selfish i know i can be so selfish
i could tell by how i treat you with my girl damn she so selfless
but she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
and though it dont always show i love her just like i love you
and i need to treat you better
wish you could live forever
so we could spend more time together
i love you mama

another day another rhyme ho
another day another time zone
today i woke up feeling horny so its only right
i got two bitches playing on my trombone
keep up never sure where the words would take me
niggas eat em up and regurgitate me
shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
give a virgin the urge to rape me nigga please
best friends really make great for enemies
my watch came niggas cant wait for one of these
i see you nigga this aint no rolex its a ap nigga
im hot dog catch up to me niggauh couldnt resist
aim for the stars and i shouldnt have missed
but i was riding on fumes so i stopped by the moon
now im sitting on the hood of this bitch
like thanks for the view waiting on thanks from a few
cause without me you wouldnt exist
you know that shit gave you the blueprint dont forget
cole is your phone on zero percent
going off now niggas showing off
niggas swear they hard but they flowing soft
im taking off like boing on a big ass boeing
getting head like a coin toss too easy


i grew up a fucking screw up
tie my shoe up wish they was newer
damn need something newer
in love with the baddest girl in the city i wish i knew her
i wish i wasnt so shy i wish i was a bit more fly
i wish that i could tell her how i really feel inside
that im the perfect nigga for her but then maybe thats a lie
she like a certain type of nigga and its clear im not that guy
ball player star player im just watchin from the side
on the bench cause my lack of confidence wont let me fly
i aint grow up with my father i aint thinkin bout that now
fast forward four years or so from now ill probably cry
when i realize what i missed but as of now my eyes are dry
cause im trying to stay alive
in the city where too many niggas die
dreamin quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
who am i
ayy who am i

i always did shit the hard way
my nigga squirrel slangin in the hallway
burnt cds and trees like this was broadway
times square kept the dimes there in the locker
some reggie miller
with more brown hairs than chewbacca
whispers that he got it for the low low sell a
dime for a dub them white boys aint know no better
besides whats twenty dollars to a nigga like that
he tell his pops he need some lunch
and he gon get it right back
i peep game
got home snatched my mama keychain


and i thought about you today
and i thought about the things you used to say
and i thought about the things we did
and i thought about your newest kid
and damn that makes two now
oh what do i do now
cause if we ever got together
id have to be them niggas step pops forever
and well that aint my thing cause i
i aint even got my own
and i aint really got no home
no place to put these things i own
and i thought about the games you used to play
and i thought about that little kid
i always thought that we would be together
i always knew that we would be together
but i dont wanna wait forever
i dont wanna wait forever

on the rebound like a book back
on the rebound like a put back
dont just sit back bitch get on it
time fly by way too quick dont it
reflection bring regrets dont it
rejection makes you defensive
so you protect your pride with your reflexes
but life is a game with no reset on the end

since a youngin always dreamed of gettin rich
look at me my nigga
fantasize about a white picket fence
with some trees my nigga
used to want a pathfinder with some tints
thats all i need my nigga
throw some twentys on that bitch and get it rinsed
but now i see my nigga
that the worlds a lot bigger ever since
picked up the paper
and they say my nigga eddie caught a body im convinced
anybody is a killer all you gotta do is push em to the limits
fuck being timid in the civic
politicin with the pushers and the pimps
im tryna write a story can i get a glimpse
yeah can i get a glimpse

listen up im about to go and get rich
fuck with me my nigga
we gon circle round the ville and hit a lick
cop some tree my nigga
and some powder bag it up and make it flip
you gon see my nigga
one day we gon graduate and cop a brick
and thats the key my nigga
listen up im bout to go and get rich
stand back and watch if you want to nigga
me i want my pockets fat a badder bitch
tired of seein niggas flaunt i wanna flaunt too nigga
watch some rollers in a fuckin crown vic
tryna lock a nigga up thats what they wont do nigga
wanna know a funny thing about this shit
even if you let em kill your dream
itll haunt you nigga haunt you


its beauty in the struggle ugliness in the success
hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
i grew up in the city and though sometimes we had less
compared to some of my niggas
down the block man we were blessed
and life cant be no fairytale no once upon a time
but i be goddamned if a nigga dont be tryin
so tell me momma please why you be drinkin all the time
does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind
cause pain still lingers on mine
on the road to riches listen this is what youll find
the good news is nigga you came a long way
the bad news is nigga you went the wrong way
think being broke was better

for whats money without happiness
or hard times without the people you love
though im not sure whats bout to happen next
i asked for strength from the lord up above
cause ive been strong so far
but i can feel my grip loosenin
quick do somethin before you lose it for good
get it back and use it for good
and touch the people how you did like before
im tired of livin with demons cause they always invitin more
now i dont mean that phrase with no disrespect
to all my niggas out there livin in debt
cashin minimal checks turn on the tv see a nigga rolex
and fantasize about a life with no stress
i mean this shit sincerely
and as a nigga who was once in your shoes
livin with nothin to lose i hope one day you hear me
always gon be a bigger house somewhere but nigga feel me
long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
always gon be a whip thats better than the one you got
always gon be some clothes thats fresher than the ones you rock
always gon be a bitch thats badder out there on the tours
but you aint never gon be happy til you love yours


yeah life is a balance
you lose your grip you can slip into an abyss
no doubt you see these niggas trippin
ego in charge of every move hes a star
and we cant look away due to the days that he caught our hearts
hes fallin apart but we deny it
justifying that half ass shit he dropped we always buy it
when he tell us he a genius but its clearer lately
its been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
there was a time when this nigga was my hero maybe
thats the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
cause i believed him when he said his shit was purer and he
the type of nigga swear he real but all around hims fake
the women the dickriders you know the yes men
nobody with the balls to say somethin to contest him
so he grows out of control
into the person that he truly was all along its startin to show
damn wonder what happened
maybe its my fault for idolizin niggas
based off the words they be rappin
but come to find out these niggas dont even write they shit
hear some new style bubblin up then they bite this shit
damn thats what i get for lyin to myself
well fuck it whats more important is hes cryin out for help
while the worlds eggin him on im beggin him to stop it
playin his old shit knowin he wont top it
false prophets

i got a homie he a rapper and he wanna win bad
he want the fame the acclaim the respect thats been had
by all the legends so every time i see him he stressin
talkin bout niggas dont fuck with him this shit is depressin
and i know he so bitter he cant see his own blessings
goddamn nigga you too blind to see you got fans nigga
and a platform to make a classic rap song
to change a niggas life but you too anxious livin life
always worried bout the critics who aint ever fuckin did it
i write whats in my heart dont give a fuck who fuckin with it
but in a sense i can relate the need to be great
turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late
writin words hopin people observe the dedication
that stirs in you constantly but intentions get blurred
do i do it for the love of the music or is there more to me
do i want these niggas to worship me

these rappers insecure
they talk about being a man so much
i finally understand that they aint even sure
bout who they are and why they do this
guess im included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory
my highest moments come from tellin all the saddest stories
ive seen in my life i be fiendin to write
songs that raise the hair on my arms
my lowest moments came from tryin too hard
to impress some niggas that couldnt care if im on
therefore from here on out my hair grow out
i care nothin bout opinions
i wanna give hope like the fountains you throw pennies in
hit the store take your diss make your wish
this is dedicated to the ones that listen to me on some faithful shit
im on some thankful shit
but the real god is in you not the music you coppin
i hear my old shit and know i can top it


look its the return of the mr burn suckers
not herpes infested just perfectly blessed with
a style that you cant f with protection recommended
cause cole the definition of a weapon that can end it
you know mass destruction when i mash the button
i take your favorite major rapper left him independent
cryin in the corner
cause i aint into sorta kinda dissin niggas
im borderline addicted to slaughter
line up niggas in order
of who you think can really fuck with me most
then i tuck the heat close if he dont duck then he ghost
aint no need for discussion
if they werent talkin bout the bread these motherfuckers be toast
clap at the fake deep rappers
the og gatekeep rappers


yeah
my mind state feel like the crime in the summertime
higher than average
lot of cabbage
thank god i never abide by the established
guidelines that keep niggas inside of fabrics
commissioned by the state i skate by the masters
like yoo hoo with a new new ridin passenger
shout out oak cliff im bout to fly to dallas
decade from now i might just buy the mavericks
what up mark cuban
i am only part human half man half amazing
plus im good at math like im asian
hate to use stereotypesbut thats light compared to what a nigga get from caucasians
no race baitintreat the beat like playstation
reporting to you live from the international space station
i probably vacation on mars
the flow is out of this world and so is the bars
blow the facade right off of your squad
lil rappers i love you but you aint shit til you got offers in prague
look that shit up
a book nigga pick that shit up
expand your vocab
im giving out toe tags for no cash
all summer long plus three seasons after
please cc a rapper tell him meet me
its absolutely imperative that my heat speak to rappers
the problem with this game is this weak sea of rappers
im the answer on the low im a cheat sheet for rappers
i came up round ac to dc adapters
plug talk what im really sayin is a shame but my niggas move caine like hbcu kappas
whole town full of cc sabathias
you think niggas gettin fat pitchin crack
not really
this is not the eighties dont be silly
now we push pills and sell heroin to billy
now billy momma want the judge to pardon his addiction
how many black addicts that got caught up in the system
with no sob stories on your prime time television i can smell a blatant contradiction
man listen
dont want to fuck up my vibe
lets end it on a positive note come see me live
kodalbum of the year undebatably
my cadence be the greatest weve seen since the late mc whose name was the notorious
dreamville stacked like the warriors
winning back to back
next up to bat is my nigga bas
after that jiddy jid
thats that new york city kid plus atl
me im from the ville but i know them towns well
before i had a deal i was givin niggas hell
now im givin niggas deals and they givin niggas hell


she like them boys with the big ol chains
ridin around town in a big ol range
i knew her when i rocked big ol jeans

just to give it to ya like you asked for it
man that thing in them jeans too fat for her
rebounds so i caught her off the backboard
i told her baby girl come here
know i run the town even when i aint from there
and i brag hardly but just to show up at this party
i made what yo nigga make in one year
thats unfair but so is life take a chance roll the dice

im only here for the night

carolina blue kicks fresh on the scene

i mean i got this hidden agenda that you provokin
i got bath water that you can soak in things i could do with lotion

and when you think you like it i promise you gonna love it
yeah when lights comin through the drapes and we both yawnin
i roll over and ask if i can hit it in the mornin

hey god bless the child that can hold his own
god bless the woman that can hold patron
god bless her homegirl that drove us home
no strings attached like a cordless phone
you see my intentions with you was clear
im learnin not to judge a woman by the shit that she wear
therefore you shouldnt judge a nigga off the shit that you hear
get all defensive apprehensive all because my career
to be fair i know we barely know each other and yeah
somehow i wound up in your bed so where we headed from here
just say youre scared if youre scared
but if you through frontin we can do somethin
and you know just what im talkin about

same nigga used to drive around with yo girl
in my mamas civic now im out here tryna get it
i aint like you lame ass niggas boy i spit it how i live it
so when you see me in the streets man i aint gotta mimic
cause i aint got an image to uphold this real shit
i aint got a gimmick i just flow the niggas went nuts for
the boy that set fire to the booth
in a game full of liars it turns out that im the truth
some say that raps alive it turns out that im the proof
cause the ones yall thought would save the day cant even tie my boots
the ones yall thought could hang with me cant even tie my noose
let these words be my bullets nigga i dont rhyme i shoot bang

lord i been dreamin bout the paper get rich fore i see my life taper
hope my mama get to see jamaica before she meet her maker
i hoop was never good enough to ever be a laker
but these words i record got me ballin jordan
more than a rapper this a natural disaster
boy im meaner than katrina mixed with gina shut up cole
this is for my niggas back home homes what up bo
this is for the bitches that played me what up ho
nah i aint mad its sad you went from bad to real bad
two kids that dont even know their real dad
real sad baby girl i wish you still had it
then maybe you could get a taste of livin villematic
is cole still at it yall be talkin about the same shit
thats how i feel about it mama was a real addict
thats why i dont respect that lyin ass white shit you talkin
coles planning funerals you might fit the coffin

get on your job lil mane this aint saturday
we in two different lanes you cant navigate
we in two different games you playin patty cake
brother youre lame youre shane battier
you out of shape my mind run a mile a minute
the skys the limit im so high im divin in it
my rides is tinted my knobs gettin slobbed up in it
she hollerin god man you wouldve thought that god was in it
but its just a nigga god invented
the best out foolish pridell make you not admit it
but if this shit aint fire nigga why you noddin with it
the hate in your blood cant stop your soul from vibin with it
now you all conflicted cause my flows is wicked
and my hoes is thicker and all of yours is pickin me
cause they know a star when they see a star nigga
aint even got to fuck him to know he a raw nigga
i got her in my bedroom but cheer up nigga
you saved so many hoes you a hero nigga
medal of honor im feelin on top like pac
when he slept with madonna hey this is death before dishonor
get arrested and forget to tell my mama
she got enough to stress about my niggas gonna get me out
then we hit the club with the thugs and the liquors
no criminal record but im makin criminal records
isnt it ironic isnt it iconic
jacket so expensive you wouldnt even try on it
but it fit me perfect i purchase it if i want it
the city on my shoulder so no girl you cant cry on it
when you make a list of the greatest aye am i on it
maybe not yet but bitch i got the clock set
it goes tick tock game on lock
son gon shine but the reign wont stop oh no


yeah i had this little bad thing somethin like them tens
she gave a nigga mad brain somethin like the wiz
but you see the sad thing fuckin with her is
is the chick aint even have brains dummy like a bitch
so i tried to show her about the world
and about just who we really are
and where weve come and how we still have to go really far
like baby look at how we live broke on the boulevard
so now we in the hotel mirrors on the ceilin
she say she wanna blow ls i hear her and im willin
but every time i smoke well a nigga mind gone
so that every word i spoke well im tryna put her on
but she couldnt hear me
i told her all about how we been livin a lie
and that they love to see us all go to prison or die
like baby look at how they show us on the tv screen
but all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans
then all i really want is for her to get on top
before you know it she workin jerkin it nonstop
and all that next shit i was previously talkin
is now that wet shit that im currently lost in
and while that sweat drip i am reminded
all the times my brother told me that pussy is blindin
im findin the more i grow
the more yall seem to stay the same
dont even know the rules but yet yall tryna play the game
and aint it shameful how niggas blame hoes for givin birth
to a baby that took two to make
coward nigga you a fake
how you gonna look in your sons face and turn your back
then go start another family
dawg what type of shit is that
she said its okay rub my head and told me to relax
laid a nigga down proper like she was recordin tracks
said i know you wanna change the world
but for the night please
just reach over and hit the lights please


angel eyes long hair i see you cryin whats wrong there
he did what he fucked who we know the story whats new
see i could probably rush you tell you that he shoulda loved you
take advantage fuck you tell you ill do all the shit he wouldnt do
but the truth is we all the same on different teams but its all a game
the objective tryna score you got a wife you find a whore
you fuck her fast she find her drawers pull up her pants you find the door
you drive her home she mop you off you bust again and drop her off
then repeat like an episode why we cheat ill never know
is it cause we rap heavens no lotta niggas rap though never blow
like heterosexuals girl you fine from head to toe
could it be cause my father let me know that he cheated and somehow
i never told i never told

ok thats what it is i see the game the hoes come the seasons change
the hoes go we rearrange fuck up her life shell never be the same
the ogs that beat the game forever young peter pan
thirtyfive still playing child support still paying
juggling bill paying been running round field daying
wine and dine meal paying with hopes that shell lay in
the bed and get wet then give head then you bet man
the same girl who said we just met man game colder than the fucking dead man
one night stands no best man no bridesmaids or reverends
cause wolverines depressed and dont wanna be your ex man
cause cupid aims and throw the darts there go the sparks and broken hearts
who wanna build noahs ark just to have that shit torn apart


i put my heart and soul in this game im feelin drained
unappreciated unalleviated
tired of comin up shortfuck abbreviated
want my whole name spelled out my own pain spilled out
no pain no gain i blow brainscobain
throw flames liu kang the coach aint help out so i call my own shots
up in onest class laugh even though its not funny
see a white man wonder how the fuck i got money
while he sit at coach hate to see me walk past im
young black pants sag headphones blastin
know what he askin how did he manage
with all the cards against him he used them to his advantage
slang we be speakin probably soundin like spanish
then i fuck they heads up when a nigga show manners
some new york niggas thought it was funny callin us bama
laughin at the grammar cause they didnt understand us
mustve thought we slow but little do they know
i came up in here to take advantage of that shit yall take for granted
opportunity that i would kill for
lookin at rappers like what the fuck you got a deal for
when i was assed out with my funds low
its nice to know i had the whole world at my front door

i made it to the rock even though they tried to box me out
i got the key to the game they tried to lock me out
but what they dont understand is this is all plan
its a bigger picture and you cant photoshop me out
some nigga ask me why jay never shout me out
like im supposed to give a fuck
dont you know that i be out in france
where the fans throw they hands like pacquiao


it took me all day to find some inspiration
it just hit me like a ton of bricks no renovation
problem with the game now there aint no innovation
i see my shit all in your shit we call that imitation
and they say thats flattering but i aint flattered at all
matter fact yall need to practice that more
see my man nate asked me if i gained weight
i said nah my pockets got fatter thats all
money was an issue but now that thats solved
i ball i ball like kobe in the fall
put trophies on wall rather trophies on my mantle
dog my shows be off the handle
take the proceeds go to gamble
ha bet it on black and pray i quadruple my salary
if i win maybe then i could pay sallie mae
told her i be dealin with some real life shit
she be askin when bitch when i feel like it

uh turn up the eight point eights for me
back when i was starvin no one made a plate for me
now i do it big and thats my day to day story
i got the type of shit that make a hater say sorry
bitch i made this in the crib watchin belly
eatin peanut butter jelly what the fuck the niggas tell me
they say im takin long i tell em patience is a virtue
im goin all out and bitch i never had a curfew
see when youre spittin so real
suddenly these phony niggas lose they appeal
got em feelin like my niggas when they lose they appeal
then its back to the cell back to the hell
at times i watch the news and see they talkin bout diplomacy
and they aint got a clue my niggas aint got they diplomas see
rappers show me love i wonder what it could be
i think they scared of me and they should be

hm ok were outta here
i think its safe to say we outta here
we outta here


yeah this is for all the fans that waited the bitch niggas that hated
old hoes we dated look mama we made it
your son out in barbados cheese eggs and potatoes
smokin weed on the beach as my mind workin like platos
analyzin the world fantasizin bout girls
im handin diamonds and pearls and vandalizin her curls
sweatin her weave out moans as she breathes out
fuck im doin in parties with hova and steve stoute
i step over piranha death over dishonor
they killin niggas for js thats death over designer
hey cole heatin up like that left over lasagna
remember when i used to be stressed over dwana
now a nigga only text and get stressed over rihannas
im talkin tens and better hood bitches in timbs and sweaters
and we always argue bout the same thing
and tell me why we gotta argue about the same thing same thing man

oh yeah to my college girl take the weekend off and come home soon
i graduated way too long ago to be sneakin all in your dorm room
but that thing tight like fort knox
so i call you when the tour stops
but baby where your roommates
did you make sure the doors locked
she love it when we get together
smoke a little weed put her shit together
now that im on i can pick and choose
only fuck with hoes who got shit to lose
yeah i heard the stories bout different dudes
her man on campus but its fine by me
she say she only fucked like fourfive niggas
so you know you gotta multiply by three


baby girl i cant imagine what its like for you
i got you pregnant now inside there is a life in you
i know you wonderin if this is gon make me think bout wifin you
like if you have my first child
would i spend my whole life with you
now i aint tryna pick a fight with you im tryna talk

and frankly i feel like we aint ready and this
hold up now let me finish
think about it baby me and you we still kids ourself
how we gonna raise a kid by ourself
handle biz by ourself a nigga barely over twenty
where the hell we gon live where am i gon get that money
i refuse to bring my boy or my girl in this world
when i aint got shit to give em and im not with them niggas
who be knockin girls up and skate out
so girl you gotta think about how the options weigh out
whats the way out
uh

she said nigga you got some nerve
to come up to me talkin about abortion
this my body nigga so dont think you finna force shit
see i knew that this is how you act so typical
said you love me oh but now you flippin like reciprocals
it figures though i shouldve known
that you was just another nigga
no different from them other niggas
who be claimin that they love you just to get up in them drawers
knowin all the right things to say
i let you hit it raw mothafucka
now im pregnant you dont wanna get involved mothafucka
tryna take away a lifeis you god mothafucka
i dont think so this a new life up in my stomach
regardless if im your wife this new life here ima love it
i aint budgin i just do this by my mothafuckin self
see my mama raised me without no mothafuckin help
from a man but i still dont understand how you could say that
did you forget all those conversations that we had way back
bout your father and you told me that you hate that nigga
talkin about he a coward and you so glad that you aint that nigga
cause he left your mama when she had you and he aint shit
and here you go doin the same shit you aint shit nigga

they say everything happens for a reason
and people change like the seasons then grow apart
she wanted him to show his heart and say he loved her
he spoke the magic words and on the same day he fucked her
now she wide open
shed put a ring up on his finger if she could
but he loved her cause the pussy good
but she aint no wife though
uh oh she tellin him she missed her period like typos
he panickin froze up like a mannequin a life grows
inside her and now he askin is it even mine
what if this bitch aint even pregnant dog could she be lyin
and she be cryin cause he actin distant
like ever since i told you this nigga you actin different
and all his niggas sayin man these hoes be trappin niggas
playin with niggas emotions like they some action figures
swear they get pregnant for collateral its like extortion
man if that bitch really pregnant tell her to get a abortion
but what about your seed nigga


cole walk with a nigga i give you my pain
so much on my mind i wonder how it fit in my brain
scattered thoughts dark secrets lead me to a blacker heart
life cant get any worse stevie with his glasses off
cause i still dont see hope lookin for a quick fix
when everyone i see is broke get lost in weed smoke
knowin it make it worse thoughts roam uncontrollably
barely trustin niggas over a decade they been knowin me
shit life at the bottom nobody but god got em
they say he wouldnt leave me yet im fallin like its autumn
tell me what do you do just when youre on your last dollar
and the stress of this mess you in can make your ass holla
do you fold grow bitter and grow cold
no longer fightin now the only thing you grow is old
or do you flip that fuckin dollar to a dream
whether a scholar or a fiend watch a pawn become a king

my goal this year is a real one gonna stack a million
and as soon as i do mama that nine to five is through
and i know i aint been callin but im thinkin bout you
and all the shit that you been through
my girl and then my brother too
cause this life gets hard on this road yeah its true
i dont never tell you how much i be stressin but i do
but i suck it up for who my fans and my mans
who probably never ever had this type of lifestyle in they plans
hoppin in and out of vans on the buses on the planes
gettin brain from a bitch and thinkin goddamn whats her name
sometimes i just shake my head and tell myself this is a shame
and then my other side kick in like bitch dont be so fuckin lame
dang what a life another day another night
at times this shit is all blurry pray and hope that god heard me
just for those prayin for me man i know that yall worry
but i aint never failed and you can bet i never will


yeah

look i just shed tears homie and no i aint too proud to admit it
just seen my father for the first time in a minute
when i say a minute i mean years man
damn a whale could have swam in them tears fam
cause as i left em i reflected on my younger days
when it was just me and my brother and my mother played
father cause no other man bothered
not even my biological it never seemed logical
but i accepted it cause i aint know no better
thought i was brighter than a polo sweater
no pops was like martin with no coretta
so many things you could have told me
and saved me the trouble of letting my mistakes show me
i feel like you barely know me
and thats a shame cause our last name is the same
that blood type flowing through our veins is the same
my mama left you and it may be that angers to blame
but thats no excuse only you and god know the truth
and why you only call monthly barely ever saw me
spend some summers with you and played with my cousin maury
maybe i should be telling you fuck you cause you selfish
but i want a father so bad i cant help but

yeah i never thought id see my mama on that shit man
its fucking with her body now she sick damn
i wanted a big house with a white picket fence and a pool
who would have ever thought that it would come to this man
quicksand is what this life feel like
that shit these rappers kick is nothing like real life
you made a milli off of serving hard white yeah right

and if she strayed how could he ever know never know
and so she goes to the club on the weekend
a little freaking but them niggas holla but she never speakin
but tonight i see the devil creeping

i hate to get the seats in the benz wet
but thats how good your ass is

then follow your moves all week on twitter
probably make a gay nigga reconsider
you now rockin with the best mane
dress game down to the sex game
wont brag but the boy been blessed mane
let you play with the stick ovechkin
she callin she textin shes fallin but let me explain
gotta tell your old boyfriend skate girl

and i aint coming off of my last name
cause i really cant take no stressing
bout where i done been who i done hit
your homegirl saying he a bad boy
but im signed to the roc
no time for the gossip bitch put down them tabloids

hey globetrotter cole hotter
even way out in london town
hoes holla cause they love my sound

i love it when you give me head
i hate it when you give me headaches

hey cole world baby aint nothin sunny
i see em hating but it aint nothin to me
im from the ville where they bang for the money
and carry fo fives like change for a twenty
so what i look like scurred
them niggas over there look like nerds
never mind that girl lets make a track


hey niggas be dying on the daily
it seems my dreams faded for far too long
the consequences deadly
cant visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
control the block serving up rocks and stay subliminal
cause young niggas is hardheaded they letting off
full of adrenaline ignorant to what death can cause
aint no coming back family dressed in black
plus its hot now the cops outside its hard to flip a pack
and my daughter gotta eat her mama be stressing me
like i aint the one who put them jays on her feet
like i aint out in the field like that
i might be low for the moment but i will bounce back
despite the charges back to the wall i fight regardless
screaming fuck the law my life is lawless
thats what you call it aint got to be no psychic
to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
this is hell and i dont mean that hyperbolic
i try to find employment even if its wiping toilets
but these felonies be making life the hardest
resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
or run up on your yard snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
thats why i write this sonnet
you probably grown now so this songll hit you
if you hearing this unfortunately means
that im no longer with you in the physical
not even sure if i believe in god but because you still alive
he got me praying that the spiritual is real
so i can be a part of you still my pops was killed too
so i know how part of you feels
maybe you hate me maybe you miss me maybe you spite me
life goes in cycles maybe youll date a nigga just like me
i hope not im tired of dope spots
and fiends that smoke rocks
ive seen far too many niggas hopes rot
im writing this because me and the devil had a dance
now i see death around the corner pologizing in advance
dont know if i ever had a chance
at a glance im a failure
addicted to pushing paraphernalia
but daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once
innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
my pops shot up drug related mama addicted
so granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
blood was staining the concrete
older niggas i loved talked like they was above
maintaining a timesheet thats slow money
picked up the family business by the age of thirteen
six years later was handed sentence
round the same time is when you came in this world
me and your mama thinking
what the fuck we naming this girl
i told her nina the prettiest name that i could think of
for the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen i was nineteen
took me two felonies to see the trap
this crooked ass system set for me
and now i fear its too late for me to ever be
the one that set examples that was never set for me
im living fast but not fast enough
cause karma keeps on catching up to me
and if my past becomes the death of me
i hope you understand

its several ways i couldve went out too many to count
was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout
was it the young niggas blasting frustrated
cause the cash running out
niggas dont know how to act in a drought
see baby girl i realized
my definition of a real nigga was skewed
my views misshaped by new mixtapes
that confirmed the shit i learned in the streets was true
that real niggas dont speak when they beef with you
they just pull up on your street let the heat achoo
and if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your food
i was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops
ducking rules hugging blocks that dont love you
i pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
much broader than the corner if not its gon corner you
into a box where your son dont even know his pops
and the cyclical nature of doing time continues
my worst fear is one day that you come home from school
and see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news
i got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
and sadly if youre listening now it must mean its true
but maybe theres a chance that its not
and this album remains locked
in a hard drive like valuable jewels
and i can teach you this in person
like im teaching you to tie your own shoes
i love you and i hope to god i dont lose you
for your eyes only

one day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling
what hed been dealing with lately he wasnt telling
i tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealing
but i could feel the sense of panic in his voice
and it was chilling he said
jermaine i knew you since we was children
i never asked for nothing when times was hard
i never had discussions with you begging you to help me
i dealt with the repercussions of my actions
i know you tried to steer me way from that shit
but that shit was in my blood you know my life
i know your momma nigga send my love
in case i never get a chance to speak again
i wont forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
thats the way i wished my family lived
but my granny crib was in the jects
i had to interject like
nigga what you talking bout fuck is you getting at
he said listen i got no time to dive into descriptions
but i been having premonitions
just call it visions from the other side
i got a feeling i wont see tomorrow
like the time im living on is borrowed
with that said the only thing im proud to say i was a father
write my story down and if i pass
go play it for my daughter when she ready
and so im leaving you this record for your eyes only
dont you ever scratch or disrespect it
this perspective is a real one another lost ville son
i dedicate these words to you and all the other children
affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
that sent your pops to prison when he needed education
sometimes i think that segregation wouldve done us better
although i know that means that i would never
be brought into this world cause my daddy was so thrilled
when he found him a white girl to take back to jonesboro
with lil zach and cole world barely one years old
now its thirty years later making sure this storys told
girl your daddy was a real nigga not cause he was cold
not because he was the first
to get some pussy twelve years old
not because he used to come through
in the caddy on some vogues
not because he went from bagging up
them grams to serving os
nah your daddy was a real nigga not cause he was hard
not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
not because he screamed fuck the law
although that was true
your daddy was a real nigga cause he loved you


yeah my intuition is telling me therell be better days
i sit in silence and find whenever i meditate
my fears alleviate my tears evaporate
my faith dont deviate ideas dont have a date
but see im growing and getting stronger with every breath
bringing me closer to heavens doors with every step
as we speak im at peace no longer scared to die
most niggas dont believe in god and so they terrified
its either that or they be fearing they gon go to hell
asking the father for forgiveness got em overwhelmed
as if hes spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
see i believe if god is real hed never judge a man
because he knows us all and therefore he would understand
the ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
the bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

yeah my chosen religion
jesus piece frozen from sinnin
doin dirt hoping to god he know my intentions
to see a million fore i see a casket
i got a baby on the way know he gon be a bastard
im living fast like im in a drag race how that cash taste
when i was a senior i was ballin on my classmates
niggas put three bullets in my car one hit the gas tank
know i got a angel cause im supposed to have a halo
right now my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
for my ability to make them birds fly
fiends wanna get higher than a birds eye view
and who am i to tell a nigga what to do
i just supply its economics
my business aint got the suit and tie
keep a pistol at all times niggas want whats mine
i cant oblige dog i work too hard
so reach for it get referred to god im going hard nigga

yeah prodigal son got a new gun
this one dont run out of ammo
lately been working on my handles
can i ball become a star and remain my self
if i fall dust it off and regain my self
fuck em all they dont know all the pain i felt
im in awe after all the fame i felt i evolved
i no longer bury demons i be a vessel for the truth until im barely breathing im singing

pistols be poppin and niggas drop in a heartbeat
scattered like roaches a body laid on the concrete
a body laid on the concrete
look somebody laid on the concrete
no time for that aint no lookin back cause im running too
i made it home i woke up and turned on the morning news
overcame with a feeling i cant explain
cause that was my nigga james that was slain he was twentytwo
he was twentytwo


sometimes you worry bout the things he can provide for ya
whenever you around i seem to come alive for ya
i finally recognize the feelings thats inside for ya
although i know your man and trust me he would die for ya
these quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
and put my number in it
im staring at you from afar im wondering about you
like where you from and who you are
cause you a starno not the type that snort the white lines
i mean the type to light the night time i heard you got a man
but who in their right mind letting you out the house alone
tell me is your house a home
why you in the club looking like you out your zone
now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
on a scale from one to ten that girls a hundred and i want it
no question i know destiny well
and though i sin the lord blessing me still
every saint got a past every sinner got a future
every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday
they say its just a matter of time
and if i had my way then you would be mine


yeah i dont want no picture with the president
i just wanna talk to the man
speak for the boys in the bando
and my nigga never walkin again
apologize if im harpin again
i know these things happen often
but im back on the scene
i was lost in a dream as i write this
the team down in austin
i been buildin me a house
back home in the south ma
wont believe what its costin
and its fit for a king right
or a nigga that could sing
and explain all the pain that it cost him
my sixteen shouldve came with a coffin
fuck the fame and the fortune
well maybe not the fortune
but one thing is for sure though
the fame is exhaustin
thats why i moved away i needed privacy
surrounded by the trees and ivy league
students thats recruited highly
thinkin you do you and i do me
crib has got a big ol back ol yard
my niggas stand outside and pass cigars
filled with marijuana laughin hard
thankful that they friends a platinum star
in the driveway theres no rapper cars
just some shit to get from back and forth
welcome to the sheltuh this is pure
well help you if youve felt too insecure
to be the star you always knew you were
wait i think police is at the door

some things you cant escape
death taxes and a ra 
 cist society that make
every nigga feel like a candidate
for a trayvon kinda fate
even when your crib sit on a lake
even when your plaques hang on a wall
even when the president jam your tape


i wanna fold clothes for you
woke up this morning
feeling like the best version of me so happy
i walked in the living room
and saw you all alone on the couch just napping
i i see a lot on your plate
nine months with that weight
i know you tired so i wonder how i can help
i get the basket and grab your clothes out the dryer
oh i wanna fold clothes for you

listen this is a meditation for me
a practice in being present
theres nowhere i need to be
except right here with you
folding clothes
watching netflix
catching up on our shows
niggas from the hood is the best actors
we the ones that got to wear our face backwards
put your frown on before they think you soft
never smile long or take your defense off
acting tough so much we start to feel hard
live from the city where they pull cards
i got a glock forty and a little nine
ready for the day a nigga pull mine
gotta learn to speak in ways thats unnatural
just to make it through the job interviews
if my niggas heard me theyd say
damn whats gotten into you
just trying to make it dog somehow
peeking through the blinds i see the sun now
i see youre still sleeping and it feels like
maybe everything is gon be alright


needin me wantin me givin me a chance to feel special
to somebody in a world where they not lovin me
handcuffs keep huggin the wrists of my niggas
and i wish stuff was different here
but if i had a magic wand to make the evil disappear
that means that there would be no santa claus no more
to bring you christmas cheer
cause what he represents is really greed
and the need to purchase shit from corporations
that make a killin because they feed
on the wallets of the poor who be knockin on they door
every black friday just to get some shit they cant afford
even with the discount write a check that shit bounce
but as long as we got credit it dont matter the amount
we just swipin shit here we dont love we just likin shit here
whats that smell wheres your diaper shit here
lay on your back dont pee right now
or else ill have to get you back
one day when you gon want to get your way
yeah ill have fun with that
reminisce when you came out the womb
tears of joy i think filled up the room
you are now the reason that i fight
i aint never did nothing this right in my whole life
got me thinking

ib gon ask me how i did this shit
im gon do a humble stunt act like i meant this shit
thats the ego taking credit for what god made
fuck this album shit hey mama look what god made
catch me dont you
catch me
ive fallen in love for the first time
i wanna cry and i aint even tryna fight it
dont wanna die cause now youre here
and i just wanna be right by your side
on any night that you be cryin baby
i dry your eyes i dry your eyes


now i was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
screamin dollar and a dream with my closet lookin broke
and my niggas lookin clean gettin caught up with that dope
have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap
nigga i can tell you things that you probably shouldnt know
have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor
flashbacks to the pain wakin up cold sweats
six oclock in the mornin gotta hit the bowflex
get my weight up on the block keep watch for the cops
god they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
nowadays crime pays like a part time job
and the drought got me prayin for a carl thom vibe
summer rain come again
numb the pain cause its hard for a felon
in my mind i been cryin know its wrong but im sellin
eyes wellin up with tears
thinkin bout my niggas dead in the dirt
immortalized on this shirt

have you ever seen a fiend cook crack on the spoon
have you ever seen a nigga that was black on the moon
have you ever seen your brother go to prison as you cry
have you ever seen a motherfuckin ribbon in the sky
nope all i see is that cream nigga that green
im a black king black jeans on my black queen
and her ass fat too fat for a flat screen
im the type of nigga make the whole fuckin trap lean
kingpin nigga put wings on a crack fiend
if they want a nigga they gon have to send a swat team
and im goin out like scarface in his last scene
a legend what that mean


every time you go to sleep you look like you in heaven
plus the head game is stronger than a few excedrin
you shine just like the patent leather on my new elevens
you read me like a book like im the bible you the reverend
yeah i wanna tell the truth to you
i wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
exposing you to all my demons and the reasons im this way
i would like to paint a picture but itll take more than a day
it would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
the same wall thats stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
from the lack of having father and the passing of my peers
while im too scared to expose myself
it turns out you know me better than i know myself
better than i know myself
well how bout that


trials and tribulations im facing
in this age of information i hate this shit
cause niggas hit my phone when they want some shit
bitches hit my phone when they want some dick
damn it wont be long fore i disappear
you call it runnin i call it escapin
start a new life in a foreign location
similar to my niggas duckin cases
cant take the possible time that he faces


im searching and praying and hoping for something
i know im gon see it i know that its coming
lord huh
but what do you do when theres no place to turn


new york times come listen to these new york rhymes
a southern nigga with a new york mind
in the concrete jungle of queens trying to be kings
getting to the money it seems by any means
as i watch it all pan out try not to stand out
fish out of water yet an official reporter
up here life is a bitch i blow a kiss at her daughter
in the city where niggas will leave you shit outta order
so yeah you heard the news disturbing news
shot a brother in the head thank the lord he aint dead
was in a coma for months eyes aint opened them once
my nigga visibly stressin a mess he smoking his blunt
what could i say i cant relate to that all i do is pray for that
this the city of god told me go and make it at
i got a date with destiny im running late for that
grab a paper hey kid you gotta pay for that

hop on the f train took the express train
skip that local shit my vocal sick thats how success came
once kings now we pawns in this chess game
wall street got black slave blood stains
which means we built this city
and never got scraps while the devil got fat
in fact reparations for niggas in desperation
fuck money get my kid a real education
blood money spills had a real revelation
southside make you realize theres still segregation
dont wanna preach im just thinking out loud
sometimes i wanna save the world and i be thinking bout how
my motive to lead my niggas to paradise
imagine the world free from pain
and we no longer scared at night
far from the crime the blind leading the blind
we dont make it primetime till we dyin

how i go from selling reefer and plates
till eating steaks with cole and playing fifa with drake
shouldve been in the states property of the jakes
now im plotting on profits and properties on the lake
let me properly integrate you to it
show you how the heads of states and gangsters do it
them niggas talk a lot of shit but they aint been through it
i done been up in everything cars you never seen
cities you never heard of from the streets where they murder
police observe us till they reach the verdict
kill em all fucking kill em all
if you cant send em to the pen send em to the morgue
send em to the lord fuck it send his broad
hundred shots through the dark but they never hit my heart
nigga bitch nigga take a pause
hundred shots through the dark you can never hit my heart


yeah
gimme my space lord aint enough time to chase
all these dreams nah mean i got no time to wait
love my girl but i told her straight up dont wait up
stumble home late im drunk we fucked and made up
used to living free as a bird but now im laid up
feelin like a nigga got handcuffs on
how the fuck did my life become a damn love song
she ride for a nigga and she stand up for him
but a nigga wan be a nigga be a nigga
ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas
shell never understand what its like to be a man
knowin when you look inside yourself you see a nigga
and you dont wan let her down
but you too young for the settle down
and maybe you can thug it out learn what is love about
when you cant live with her and you cant live without
aw shit goddamn i think the devil got his hands on me
stripper saying baby wont you throw them bands on me
and i came to spend
she pop a molly let the motherfuckin games begin
im running away

when its all said and done everybody dies
in this life aint no happy endings
only pure beginnings followed by years of sinning and fake repentance
the preacher say we were made in image of lord
to which i replied are you sure
even a murderer even a whore
even a nigga running through bitches on tour
with a good girl at home folding clothes and shit
unbelievable seen evil that not even knievel know
at age three i knew this world was three below
listen even though my ego low achieved the unachievable
imagine if my confidence was halfway decent yo
this just in fucked more bitches than bieber though
still i keep it low got my niggas on the need to know
basis my manager back in the days was racist
i was a young boy passing skates and tucking laces
old perverted white man who told me jermaine
its all pink on the inside fuck what color they face is
wise words from an indecent man
made me reflect on the times when we was three fifths of them
in chains and powerless brave souls reduced to cowardice
slaving in the baking sun for hours just
to see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
nine months later got a baby thats
not quite what you expected but you
refuse to neglect it cause you
know your wifey loves you thus you refuse to accept it
thats the type of shit that turned my granny light skinned
rich white men rule the nation still
only difference is we all slaves now the chains concealed
in our thoughts if i follow my heart to save myself
could i run away from fifty mill like dave chappelle
you know


i used to print out nas raps and tape em up on my wall
my niggas thought they was words but it was pictures i saw
and since i wanted to draw i used to read them in awe
then he dropped stillmatic rocked the cleanest velour
fast forward whod a thought that i would meet him on tour
im earnin stripes now a nigga got adidas galore
i couldnt help but think that maybe i had made a mistake
i mean you made you owe me
dog i thought that you could relate
but while i shot up the charts
you mean tellin me that i was not up to par
when i followed my heart
granted my heart was tainted
by my mind that kept on sayin
wheres the hits you aint got none
you know jayll never put your album out without none
and dog you know how come
labels are archaic formulaic with they outcome
they dont know they just study the charts
me i studied the shows the fans study they hearts
i had a feelin i was killin and this music we were spillin out
would change lives forever fuck the label put it out
friday night lights blew that was classic number two
now it seemed as if the nas comparisons was comin true
still no release date from the label are they insane
gucc told me play the game to change the game

i always believed in the bigger picture
if i could get them niggas to listen outside my core
then i can open the door


this the shit i used to roll down lewis street with
lord know some hoes from the past
like damn cole wish i knew that you would be rich
well shoulda asked

no need to fix what god already put his paintbrush on
your roommate yelling why you gotta take so long

to all the women with the flaws know its hard my darling
you wonder why youre lonely and your mans not calling
you keep falling victim cause youre insecure
and when i tell you that youre beautiful you cant be sure

take it from a man that loves what you got
and baby girl you a star dont let em tell you youre not
now is it real eyebrows fingernails hair
is it real if its not girl you dont care
cause whats real is somethin that the eyes cant see
that the hands cant touch that them broads cant be
and thats you never let em see your frown
and if you need a friend to pick you up ill be around
and we can ride with the windows down the music loud
i can tell you aint laughed in a while
but i wanna see that crooked smile

we dont look nothin like the people on the screen
you know the movie stars picture perfect beauty queens
but we got dreams and we got the right to chase em
look at the nation
thats a crooked smile braces couldnt even straighten
seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
wonder why we inhale cause we in hell already

know you felt the shit just now know you felt the shit just now
aint there more to you dont it ever get boring to you
i realize deep down you a coward getting high off of power fuck it more to you
saw through you and it made me ashamed that i played the game
not for mo money like damon wayans
wanted the respect but it came with fame
i just wanted love but this aint the same
i took a train down memory lane
and watched little jermaine do his thing before he made a name
its like sony signed basquiat
he gave it all he got and now a nigga dont paint the same damn
i guess he cant complain
all the money that be raining in
spend a hundred thou for the chain again
think of old school niggas like dana dane
probably kill for another claim to fame my brain the same
yeah nigga at least he aint insane
at least he aint insane
you aint crazy motherfucker you just afraid of change
thats new maybe thats true
but listen here i got a bigger fear
of one day that i become you
when i become lost and i become heartless
and numb from all the ménages
just one bitch dont feel the same no more
and henny dont really kill the pain no more
now im cobain with a shotgun aimed at my brain
cause i cant maintain no more
tad bit extreme i know
money cant save your soul
but there go you


look at me pathetic nigga this chain that i bought
you mix greed pain and fame this is heinous result
let these words be the colors im just paintin my heart
im knee deep in the game and it aint what i thought
copped a range rover my girl got the mercedes
iced out crazy i wanna shine like baby
compared to that nigga i aint even got a bib yet
truth be told i aint even bought a crib yet
this is everything they told a nigga not to do
image is everything i see it got a lot to do
with the way people perceive and what they believe
money short so this jewelry is like a weave
meant to deceive and hear niggas say i see you
now bitches wanna fuck you and niggas wanna be you
and police wanna stop you frisk you wonder what he do
if a hater snatch your chain i bet it still wont free you
cause i be right back grinding til i cop another
i sit and think about all this shit i coulda copped my mother
my partner said thats just the game my nigga
swear i heard my jeweler say here go your chain my nigga

ice on this white jesus seem a little unholy
the real strange thing about this iced out roley
its the same shit a broke black nigga get gassed at
same shit a rich white motherfucka laugh at
well laugh on white man i aint paid as you
but i bet your rims aint the same age as you
and i aint got no investment portfolio
but my black and white diamonds shinin like a oreo
i know back home a nigga sick today
he rock a chain and he always got some shit to say
even back when i was broke i knew his shit was fake
lord this is the last time

i swear this is the last time
i know that i said this shit last time
but this the last time
mama i swear this is the last time
so dont take my chains from me

this is martin luther king in the club
getting dubs with a bad bitch in his ear
sayin that she down for whatever
in the back of his mind is coretta

im passing up on bad hoes
trying to be the man that she want what she want
what shewhat she want from a nigga
to put a ring on it

and she just want to sing on it
got me up so high
try and get a piece of that apple pie
i be up so high
dancehall vibes with my pants on fire
cause i told her i was sleep
cause i creep with this pretty young thing that i chose
she could be doing the same thing i suppose


spinning in circles live my life without rehearsal
if i died today my nigga was it business was it personal
should this be my last breath im blessed cause it was purposeful
never got to church to worship lord but please be merciful
you made me versatile well rounded like cursive
born sinner was never born to be perfect
sucker for women licking they lips and holding these purses
back when we ran the streets who would think wed grow to be murderers
teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
and violent and hopeless i saw but never noticed
that a college point us right to be all that you can be posters uh
rest in peace to tiffany i dont know if
this the realest shit i wrote but know the realest nigga wrote this
and signed it and sealed it in a envelope and knew one day youll find it
and knew one day youd come back and rewind it singing

yeah this music shit is a gift
but god help us make it cause this music business is a cliff
i got her life in my grip she holding tight to my wrist
she screaming dont let me slip
she see the tears in my eyes i see the fear on her lips
true when i told you you the only reason why i dont flip
and go insane my roof in the pouring rain
you knew me before the fame dont lose me the more i change no
just grow with me go broke you go broke with me
i smoke you gon smoke with me
womans curse since birth man lead her to the hearse
i go bobby you go whitney damn
listen here ill tell you my biggest fears

this life is harder than youll probably ever know
emotions i hardly ever show more for you than for me
dont you worry yourself i gotta do this for me
they tell me life is a test but wheres the tutor for me
pops came late im already stuck in my ways
ducking calls from my mother for days
sometimes she hate the way she raised me but she love what she raised
cant wait to hand her these house keys with nothing to say
except


yeah god flow
paint a picture like a young pablo picasso
niggas say live fast die young so i drive slow
and pray i die old
in the drop with the top low
met a bad bitch from chicago my hat wasnt cocked yo
kept it straight shit cause yall know
and if not youll learn how them niggas in the chi go
i aint fuck her but im thinking bout it
my niggas say why you gotta think about it
the bitch want too much hit my phone too much
if i gotta be frank about it
aint worth the stress
first the text then the draws see first is sex
then its calls cause the birds obsessed
want flowers cards and the purses next
nah bitch cant get a dollar
cole on twitter bitch cant get a follow
can get a nut heard cant get enough
now she fuck a nigga thinking that she may have hit the lotto

but these bitches so predictable
im in trouble

where niggas hold techs like they mad at the ref
thats why i keep a cross on my chest either that or a vest
do you believe that eve had adam in check
and if so you gotta expect
to sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
cole is the king most definite
my little black book thicker than the old testament
niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
same bitch giving brains to the minister
the same reason they call mr cee the finisher
forbidden fruit watch for the adams apple
slick with words dont hate me son

cole world this just the tip of the iceberg
so talk shit and taste the tip of the mossberg

though my words tend to sound like proverbs
niggas dont see the preachers til we dead in the hearse
granny broke cause she always givin bread to the church

niggasll swear that they it this is as rare as it gets
rap game changed this is embarrassing shit
bunch of bitches posin on some old miss america shit
i was a wilder nigga back on my therapist shit moving careless as shit
in a city where niggas really dont care who they hit

just a young little nigga tryin to see the other side
of the railroad tracks where them scarecrows at
no brains on a nigga but theyll air your back
fuck the man uncle sam i wont sell your crack
i wont fight your wars i wont wear your hat
ima pass your classes ima learn your craft
ima fuck your daughters ima burn your flag


okay back when i was sleeping in my mama crib
or even back when i was up there in mohammed crib
paying seventeen hundred for the rent money well spent
no heater but a nigga made heat may i vent
had a thing for ya even wrote the song dreams for ya
cause i had dreams for ya thoughts of a ring for ya
childish shit you know childish shit
anonymous flowers sent you know coward shit
now a nigga signed to hov took a power trip
back home im grown now and the citys my throne now huh
the same clubs that i used to get tossed out
life got kriss krossd totally crossed out
cause now im in this bitch and im totally bossed out
old chicks crying cause they know that they lost out
but im still on you im still on you
my drink spill on me while i feel on you im sayin

well this has got to be the longest crush ever
if i ever get to fuck itd be the longest bust ever
love is a drug like the strongest stuff ever and
fuck it im on one you feel me
she on a power trip she got me where she want a nigga
wifeing in the club man my homies gon disown a nigga
like give me twenty dollars dollars
ass stupid how you get to college college
im in your city and im wonderin if youre home now
went and found a man but im hopin youre alone now
cant help but feeling like i dropped the ball cliché
i used to pop up on you at the mall each day
now typically i kick game like east bay
but you got a nigga freeze framed yelling please play
for petes sake homie pull it together
just fuck her one time and be through with forever but


all a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
run from the pain sip lean smoke tree up
when im in your town press pound hit me up
only if you down and you slurp good d up
if the work good ill be back for the re up
hate when i creep and the phone wake me up
fake like im sleep knowing damn well i be up
monkey on my back and i walk a hundred miles
guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
love get confused in the mind of a child
cause love wouldnt lie like i lie and its wild
wanna have my cake and another cake too
even if the baker dont bake like you
even when the flavor dont taste like you
so im back mobbing with the late night crew
all in your mind with fears that would come true
the back of my mind the back of my mind was you
wishing that i could blind myself from view
and only have eyes and only have eyes for you

i love her i dont want to lose her
im selfish i know that i use her
my ego get stroked and i bruise her
my actions i know they confusin
at home i look happy as usual
on the road im a mack im a chooser
im a addict im maskin that
kevins heart


niggas hating on me i aint used to that
know a couple people wanna shoot for that
i say no no no chill it aint no need for that
them niggas tryna blow and aint need me for that
and if it work for them well shit im cool with that
cause how they feel i aint got shit to do with that
i just sit back on cool and watch my paper stack
and trip off how much bread them crackers take from that

yeah i pay taxes so much taxes shit dont make sense
where do my dollars go you see lately i aint been convinced
i guess they say my dollars supposed to build roads and schools
but my niggas barely graduate they aint got the tools
maybe cause the tax dollars that i make sure i send
get spent hirin some teachers that dont look like them
and the curriculum be tricking them them dollars i spend
got us learning about the heroes with the whitest of skin
one thing about the men thats controlling the pen
that write history they always seem to white out they sins
maybe well never see a black man in the white house again
ill write a check to the irs my pockets get slim
damn do i even have a say bout where its goin
some older nigga told me to start votin
i said democracy is too fuckin slow
if im givin yall this hard earned bread i wanna know
better yet let me decide bitch its two point eighteen
let me pick the things im funding from an app on my screen
better that than letting wack congressman ive never seen
dictate where my money go straight into the palms of some money hungry company that make guns that circulate the country and then wind up in my hood making bloody clothes
stray bullet hit a young boy with a snotty nose
from the concrete he was prolly rose
now his body froze and nobody knows what to tell his mother
he did good at the white man schools unlike his brother
who was lost in the streets all day not using rubbers
so right now he got two on the way
still sleep on covers in his mama house
she cant take this shit no more she want him out
on the morning of the funeral just as shes walking out
wiping tears away grabbing her keys and sunglasses
she remember that she gotta file her taxes damn


i cant have no sympathy for fuck niggas
all this shit ive seen done made my blood thicker
spill promethazine inside a double cup
double up my cream now thats a double stuff yeah
please dont hit my phone if it aint bout no commas
keep the peace like dalai lama big body hummers
backin out the parkin spot and though the law be on him
he exempt shawn kemp he keep that forty on him
go

woah suddenly i feel like takin a pj
fly to dr on a weekday eatin ceviche
with like half of a mili inside of my briefcase
a couple of freaks play
and they dont speak inglés
but the money is somethin that they could comprende
and i got bread like im green day
i come around and their heads turn
used to like bitches with hair permed
now i like it natural actual factual
naps and shit bougie still do ratchet shit
not afraid to pass the clip
before i make the ratchet spit blaow


i wrote this shit to talk about the word addiction
to my niggas     i hope you listening
    and     i hope you listening
this is for the whole fucking ville i hope youre listening
smoking medical grade but i aint got prescription
all the way in cali where they aint got precipi 
 tation feeling like the only one that made it
and i hate it for my niggas cause they aint got ambition
fuck did you expect you can blame it on condition
blame it on crack you can blame it on the system
blame it on the fact that twelve got jurisdiction
to ride around in neighborhoods that they aint ever lived in
blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing
blame it on trump shit blame it on clinton
blame it on trap music and the politicians
or the fact that every black boy wanna be pippen
but they only got twelve slots on the pistons
blame it on the rain milli vanilli with the disk skip
what im tryna say is the blame can go deep as seas
just to blame em all i would need like twenty cds
theres all sorts of trauma from drama that children see
type of shit that normally would call for therapy
but you know just how it go in our community
keep that shit inside it dont matter how hard it be
fast forward them kids is grown and they blowing trees
and popping pills due to chronic anxiety
i been saw the problem but stay silent cause i aint jesus
this aint no trial if you desire go higher please
but fuck that now im older i love you cause you my friend
without the drugs i want you be comfortable in your skin
i know you so i know you still keep a lot of shit in
you running from yourself and you buying product again
i know you say it helps and no im not trying to offend
but i know depression and drug addiction dont blend
reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
and i done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end
one thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
id rather see you stand up and face them than run away
i understand this message is not the coolest to say
but if you down to try it i know of a better way
meditate


one point eightyfive i arrived
thirtythree years damn im grateful i survived
we wasnt sposed to get past twentyfive
jokes on you motherfucker we alive
all these niggas popping now is young
everybody say the music that they make is dumb
i remember i was eighteen
money pussy parties i was on the same thing
you gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
everybody talkin like they know somethin these days
niggas actin woke but they broke umm
i respect the struggle but you all frontin these days
man they barely old enough to drive
to tell them what they should do who the fuck am i
i heard one of em diss me im surprised

see if i can paint for you the large picture
congrats cause you made it out your mamas house
i hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
i see your watch icy and your whip foreign
i got some good advice never quit tourin
cause thats the way we eat here in this rap game
im fuckin with your funky lil rap name
i hear your music and i know that raps changed
a bunch of folks would say that thats a bad thing
cause everythings commercial and its pop now
trap drums is the shit thats hot now
see ive been on a quest for the next wave
but never mind that was just a segue
i must say by your songs im unimpressed hey
but i love to see a black man get paid
and plus you havin fun and i respect that
but have you ever thought about your impact
these white kids love that you dont give a fuck
cause thats exactly whats expected when your skin black
they wanna see you dab they wanna see you pop a pill
they wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
and somewhere deep down fuck it i gotta keep it real
they wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
so when you turn up you see them turnin up too
you hit the next city collect your money when its due
you gettin that paper swimmin in bitches i dont blame you
you aint thinkin bout the people thats lookin like me and you
true you got better shit to do
you coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
i know you think this type of revenue is never endin
but i wanna take a minute just to tell you that aint true
one day them kids thats listening gon grow up
and get too old for that shit that made you blow up
now your shows lookin light cause they dont show up
which unfortunately means the money slow up
now you scramblin and hopin to get hot again
but you forgot you only popped cause you was ridin trends
now you old news and you goin through regrets
cause you never bought that house but you got a benz
and a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
and a bunch of fake friends i aint judgin you
im just tellin you whats probably gon happen when you rappin
bout the type of shit you rappin bout
its a faster route to the bottom
i wish you good luck
im hoping for your sake that you aint dumb as you look
but if its really true what people sayin
and you call yourself playin with my name
then i really know you fucked trust
ill be around forever cause my skills is tip top
to any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
just remember what i told you when your shit flop
in five years you gon be on love  hip hop nigga


lost in a cloud of marijuana
young carolina nigga fish out of water
step daddy just had a daughter with another woman
mama aint recover yet
callin me at twelve at night
she drunk as fuck and im upset
cause why she always using me for crutch
growin up i used to always see her up
late as shit cigarette smoke and greatest hits from marvin gaye
she kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
i gotta leave this house cause part of me dies when i see her like this
too young to deal with pain
id rather run the streets than see her kill herself
so ville became my escape from a feelin i hate
mama cursing me out
depressions such a villainous state
i used to stay out later on purpose
subconsciously i was nervous that if i came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
and then id have to end up seein my hero on ground zero
tears flow while al green blow
love and happiness
i wish that i could say the right words to cheer her up
i wish her sons love was enough
i tell her mama go to sleep
she tell me boy hush you better pray to god you never get your heart crushed
i shake my head in frustration
head to my room and i can still hear the tunes with my door shut
fuck it though a couple more months ill be gone
off to college and dorms
foolin myself thinkin problems are gone
but now its one am and my mama dialin my phone
i know she intoxicated and soon this high that im on comes crashin down
she lit talkin drunk shit im pissed
but im still all ears like basset hounds
thinkin to myself maybe my mama need help
dont she got work in the morning
why she do this to herself
hate how she slurrin her words
soundin so fuckin absurd
this aint the woman i know why i just sit and observe
why dont i say how i feel
when i do shes defensive for real
well maybe things get better with time i heard it heals
little did i know how deep her sadness would go
lookin back i wish i woulda did more instead of runnin


right now im starin out the window of my range and contemplating am i sane
have i sacrificed for fame
my occupations on my brain
thought that i could change it all if i had change
but the niggas that i came up with way back is still the same
i be tryna give em game like santa did when christmas came
they be listenin but its clear to me they did not hear a thing
it go in one ear and out the other like a bullet out the muzzle of a pistol shot by brothers standin point blank range
niggas bang in the ville i always thought that shit was strange
how you claim blood or cuz when that was just a la thing
i dont mean no disrespect towards your set no im just sayin
that it seem like for acceptance niggas will do anything
niggas will rep any gang niggas will bust any head
niggas will risk everything point him out and then he dead
shootin up where his granny live blaow blaow his granny duck
he dont give a fuck hes on henny and xannyd up
blowin tammy up bitch when you gon give them panties up
he gon plant a seed but best believe he aint man enough
just because yo dick can spray semen it dont mean that you ready to let go of yo childish ways
the results are deadly
because that child will suffer and thats what can most affect me
the little girl i met this past summer said dont forget me
i wont forget you how could i with all you went through
a bullet hit yo cousin in temple while he was with you
and while you was talkin i was tearin up wheres the tissue
if you was my sister then i would kiss you and tell you that im sorry for the pain you had to live through
i know im blessed because yo stress is realer than anything i done been through


yeah i got some niggas that still owe me an apology
ima be the bigger man just like i always be
eventually but right now thats hard for me
im dreaming violent i cant tolerate disloyalty
so ima see you when i see you know that day comin
i pray that on that day you slip and say something
i never fantasize bout murder cause im still sane
but i cant seem to fight this urge to make you feel pain
i know that vengeance is the lords and its not for me
i know the punishment for you is that you not with me
you place your value on the bitches that you got with me
and now the bitches ask you daily why you not with me
i had to cut some people off cause they was using me
my heart is big i want to give too much and usually
i send the bread and dont hear back for like two months now
you hit my phone you need a loan oh im a crutch now
i had to learn i never had shit
you never would split you was hood rich
i couldnt get a dollar from you i remember that
it was blurry for a while but now its coming back


wow niggas been crampin my style
blowin my high they want a reply
the number one question is how
how does it feel now that you on
how much you worth how big is your home
how come you wont get a few features
i think you should how bout i dont
how bout you just get the fuck off my dick
how bout you listen and never forget

tip of the iceberg that tipped the titanic

as big as the fuckin atlantic im lit bitch

how i grew up only few wouldve loved
member i got my first view of the blood
im hangin out and they shoot up the club
my homie got pharmaceutical plug
i smoke the drug and it run through my vein
i think its workin its numbin the pain

bitches been askin what have you done lately
i stacked a few ms like my last name was shady
my life is too crazy no actor could play me


yeah
damn i love your sense of humor
you dont get caught up in rumors
you dont be talking bout who fuckin who
and i notice the way you maneuver
sexy but never show too much
aint heard from you in like two months
all of a sudden you pop on my line
you could make time stop on a dime
i think you mastered the art of sublime
your type is harder to find
you could turn water to wine yeah
you could turn water to wine feel me

feel like i gotta say somethin
thought of you got my heart jumpin
but i cant come up with nothin
i put it off for a day
i come back around your way
searching for what i could say
that accurately could convey
the way that i feel in the word
thats different than what you done heard
so many done hit you wit game
so many been sent to the curb
and i did not come here to play
and i did not come to observe
but i did not come to observe
feel me


i know that its difficult
im stackin this paper its sort of habitual
i blow the residual
and fuckin yo bitch like its part of my ritual
pardon the visual
but money it give me a hard on its typical
i want it in physical
a million dollars i count up in intervals
without it im miserable
dont wanna fall off so im all in my bag
thankin god like its biblical
i know its gon solve every problem i have
i balled on the principal
remember the teachers was all on my ass
now look all of them pitiful
and all of a sudden im so good at math

proceed with caution
i heard if you chase it only results in
a hole in your heart
fuck it i take the whole cake and i wont leave a portion
its only an organ
thank god mama couldnt afford the abortion
the loneliest orphan
i flip my misfortune and grow me a fortune
my rollie is scorchin
them niggas that hated is slowly endorsin
now cole he important
my niggas beside me like tommy and martin
we ball on your court and
then skate with your bitch like we tonya harding
she dont need her garments
she horny from all the money we countin


im all in my bag this hard as it get
i do not snort powder i might take a sip
i might hit the blunt but im liable to trip
i aint poppin no pill but you do as you wish
i roll with some fiends i love em to death
i got a few mil but not all of them rich
what good is the bread if my niggas is broke
what good is first class if my niggas cant sit
thats my next mission thats why i cant quit
just like lebron get my niggas more chips
just put the rollie right back on my wrist
this watch came from drizzy he gave me a gift
back when the rap game was prayin id diss
they act like two legends cannot coexist
but id never beef with a nigga for nothin
if i smoke a rapper its gon be legit
it wont be for clout it wont be for fame
it wont be cause my shit aint sellin the same
it wont be to sell you my latest lil sneakers
it wont be cause some nigga slid in my lane
everything grows its destined to change
i love you lil niggas im glad that you came
i hope that you scrape every dollar you can
i hope you know money wont erase the pain
to the ogs im thankin you now
was watchin you when you was pavin the ground
i copied your cadence i mirrored your style
i studied the greats im the greatest right now
fuck if you feel me you aint got a choice
now i aint do no promo still made all that noise
this year gon be different i set my intentions
i promise to slap all that hate out your voice

im dead in the middle of two generations
im little bro and big bro all at once
just left the lab with young twentyone savage
im bout to go and meet jigga for lunch
had a long talk with the young nigga kodak
reminded me of young niggas from ville
straight out the projects no fakin just honest
i wish that he had more guidance for real
too many niggas in cycle of jail
spending they birthdays inside of a cell
we coming from a long bloodline of trauma
we raised by our mamas lord we gotta heal
we hurting our sisters the babies as well
we killing our brothers they poisoned the well
distorted self image we set up to fail
ima make sure that the real gon prevail nigga


american hypocrisy oh let me count the ways
they came here seekin freedom
then they end up ownin slaves
justified it usin christianity which saves
religion dont mean shit theres too much ego in the way
thats why isis is a crisis
but in reality this country do the same shit
take a life and call it righteous
remember when bin laden got killed supposedly
in a hotel lobby after a show was noticin
these white ladies watchin cnn coverin the action
they read the headline and then they all started clappin
as if lebron had just scored a basket at the buzzer
i stood there for a second
watched them high five each other
for real i thought this was thou shalt not kill
but police still lettin off on niggas in the ville
claimin that he reached for a gun
they really think we dumb and got a death wish
now somebodys son is layin breathless
when i was a little boy my father lived in texas
pulled up in toyota drove that bitch like it was lexus
put my bag in his trunk and headed off for dallas
out there for the summer feelin just like i was alice
lost in the wonderland where niggas still sufferin
just like they was back home and thats wrong
so now its fuck the government
they see my niggas strugglin
and they dont give a fuck at all and thats wrong yeah

i had a convo with the president i paid to go and see him
thinkin about the things i said id say when i would see him
feelin nervous sittin in a room full of white folks
thinkin about the black man plight think i might choke
nope raised my hand and asked a man a question
does he see the struggle of his brothers in oppression
and if so if you got all the power in the clout
as the president whats keepin you from helpin niggas out
well i didnt say nigga but you catch my drift
he looked me in my eyes and spoke and he was rather swift
he broke the issues down
and showed me he was well aware
i got the vibe he was sincere and that the brother cared
but dawg you in the chair whats the hold up
he said theres things that i wanna fix
but you know this shit nigga politics
dont stop fightin and dont stop believin
you can make the world better
for your kids before you leave it
change is slow always has been always will be
but fuck that ima bust back til they kill me
but fuck that ima bust back until they kill mefeel me

the type of shit that make you wanna let go
the type of shit that make you wanna

heres a thought for my revolutionary heart
take a deeper look at history its there to pick apart
see the people at the top
they get to do just what they want
til after a while the people at the bottom finally get smart
then they start to holla revolution
tired of livin here destitution
fuck that lootin can you tell me whats the best solution
i used to think it was to overthrow oppressors see
if we destroy the system that means well have less of greed
but see its not that simple
i got to thinkin about the history of human nature

see im somethin like a phenomenon
go ahead and judge me i aint gotta honor yall
shit i told the judge ill sit never mind the bond
nigga i wont budge in this bitch its like im a don
you cant con a con
left from the long arm of the law
actin right as if my momma involved
my monologue say im back at it
one life so son live it
im committed never did it and wish that i undid it
young kiddies listen the one talkin aint really with it
just forget it would they be talkin if they was really with it
come visit and see that the loudest one aint the one with it
and the one with it is the last one you want with it
been stabbed and jumped slitted
bad then son ascended
and i pum chika chika chika pum pum ch pum chika
never worry or doubt me if you heard about me
awake with nightmares grew with murder around me
im still hitting my shmoney  shmurda and rowdy
ayye calling a bluff
im grown so i never think anythings more than it was like horrible bud
never beefin over these bitches cause its more that i love
i aint warring with cuz over what shes offering but
she got my hammer on rock im like thor in the club
while she semi off the remy bitch got my dick all the way up

look what the lords been agin
straight from the horses jaws of hay
with an enormous rage weighin
unfortunate we dont know the origin but its important is all they sayin
this a formal statement
the airports are delaying got reporters waiting
live from a caucus in a secaucus basement
for rage to leave the cage like a lawless agent
a psycho ward patient thats often pacing
was rage dragging a corpse like a dog with steak umms
for the organizations inauguration
i got shooters on call with the fours just aching
in the four door explorer with the awful gray tints
notes over ya head this a orchestration
how it is when the author give the authorization
imploring you all to ignore the baiting
you gon give ya opinion they gon call it hatin
by law
yeah nigga i know
still gotta ride though i know
look now the side show i dont play it
i might have my nigga tory
see we live by a code
lemme see u get em get em
real nigga by law


to my dear dearly departed
shits becomin all that i feared heres where it started
seems that nothings as it appears swear its retarded
no wonder i get speared by my peers yeah im a target
it used to take a nation of millions for niggas not to be
amerikkas most gave america hope
back when the music had a message in it
we was rebels against it
the best was intended to lessen the gimmicks
but now yall made a mess of it
and somebody gotta address this shit
rakim would never wear a dress and shit
i aint a pessimist to say i aint impressed with it
your hearings bad you think its alive now thats the death in it
when it was all about bars wanted to weddin it
surround yourself with bullshit youll be liable to step in it
came here with one objective gettin it further
now im watchin my first love die witnessin murder
when common stopped lovin ol girl what was he tellin me
cold world now she wont dig you without a melody
love nerds used to be into niggas with felonies
we need a new president where the fuck is eric b
or did my wordplay confuse her
now i see her with young thug and future
like what did you niggas do to her
now my generalization is this generation
the imminent state of this gentrification desensitization
i call her shes in marvins room everything is awkward now
she moved more to south deserted her new yorker crowd
met her with a cane she changed prefer to walk it out
stopped eatin meat when she heard i worked in a slaughterhouse
now shes a new dame glued to the fame
she used to hate accessorizin now shes wearin two chains
relationship too strained i dont know who to blame
when i tell her you changed she say who would be the same
she right cause this aint the way we knew each other
or do i face the fact that maybe we outgrew each other
it took a while but thats finally understood
she wouldnt change if she could
i swear if this is love im good

look i cant get with you at all our issue is tall
you tied to every nigga now that dribbles a ball
did i miss a red flag you wasnt fickle before
i cant even ridicule yall thatd be a bitter resolve
wanna talk about our history
i feel like everything you say is contradictory
whenever you come visit me
i look at you and see remembrance remnants
plenty resentments its not you but theres resemblance
we diss each other all out of fun shit amuses me
you threaten every girl im with that just confuses me
say you want kids real soon now thats abuse to me
and i just write about it in song youre like a muse to me
i wanna ask where you see yourself in five years
how you goin about that like whats the verdict
i wanna ask if you ever replay the past over
and if you do when you finished is it worth it
i wanna ask if we love each other so much
how do we cause each other so much pain
still in all in each others lives
weve remained without a claim
i know somell call that clinically insane
how do we remedy the games
look i can see the pain in your eyes i wanna fix it
but all your words are fuelin my pride so im dismissive
you think i wanna sit in this courtroom
talkin supervised scrutinized by suit and ties you a lie
you could cry the conditions of you and i cant escape it
every lie she told you over the years im face to face with
and now they manifested
youre overwhelmed and congested
but feelin neglected i gotta respect it
i cant explain to your so young brain
since our first exchange youve been kept from me
used against as weaponry
and as much as i hate her
id never downplay your mother like that
for you to judge her like that
just a lesson later on that youll discover like that
we not alone in this process no its others like that
but you spew these sly remarks like why are we here
like why are you near like why do you care how i dispair
i gotta eat that see you got a grudge lil nigga
we flesh and blood lil nigga no ifs ands or buts lil nigga
you can think your dad is nuts lil nigga
im talkin to you cause you came out of my nuts lil nigga
thats my stance on the matter i wont budge lil nigga
and ill tell that to your mother and the judge lil nigga
at our next court date you gon see that its true
funny my condescendin ways i kinda see em in you
mannerisms when im annoyed yep im seein that too
im smilin admirin genes i kinda think that its cute
i was you twenty years ago when pop popped up
but nothin like you sad how lifell recycle a cycle
you missin intel only a dad can give
cant expect you to understand this doesnt matter to a kid
and since our situations not understood
i would fix it if i could


i mean we started with love the beginning was magical
then it ended abrupt hows it us that this happened to
was it all just a lie how was none of it factual
even in our demise it seems im always attached to you
they said if you let it go if its real it comes back to you
she just called me a thief i took it never gave back to you
after all that ive done figured youd have some gratitude
look how far we fell off we cant even be casual
guess we both had times we were being irrational
we both out of our minds how are we not compatible
say i pushed you out the door and you did what you had to do
now you play the victim like i wasnt impacted too
should be a movie star ma you so good at acting new
you like us as strangers me i think its impractical

i mean we started with love then we ended with hatred
the whole world in our business clearly nothing was sacred
i know you down to your core unless for years you just faked it
i know all of your flaws see your soul when you naked
now you got a new squad all them bitches is basic
and even if they aint it aint hard to mistake it
i think you running from love with me you gotta face it
are you guarding your heart


yeah yeah
look it was around ninetynine baby comin while i was at rock bottom
ironic shit i was listenin to rock bottom
pockets rabbit ears no paper lot of cotton
had some charges stemmin from me and my squad robbin
had to leave the hood shit stayin not an option
i bumped your shit forever felt we had a lot in common
a rapper expressin wit who spoke in depressive stints


heres my moment of clarity
ive been misleadin you all givin you half of me
ive been blazin a trail and leavin casualties
ive diagnosed myself i think its apathy
so lettin go became easy grabbin ahold thats the hardest
i know our expiration date soon as we start it
you come around and you feel safe while youre a target
you feelin like i let you inside while im guarded
its genius when arrogance seems like its modest
look past the insanity glance at the logic
appears optional all of it is stipulated
watch and learn how emotions get manipulated
now you in dire need of help
you the victim made to think you did it to yourself
speakin of rest in peace sandra bland
me im believin everything that wasnt on that cam
but back to you beauty let me address our lil movement
you in therapy but i dont see the improvement
oh whatevers been made now days is ruined
so every few months i ponder what the fuck are we doin
let me watch my words again
you easily got one of the best pussies that ive ever been inserted in
you real kind real sweet real nurturin
yet every time we link back up you just get hurt again
you put all men in a box i aint one of em
funny how you got all the answers and none of em
you only dated three men so im scared of you
cause with no point of reference what the fuck are you comparin to
you good one minute psycho the next
no longer lettin it ride too much jekyll and hyde
then you subtweet for weeks busy settin your pride
im grown dont really need that sort of mess in my life
but wait you of age you old too
i control my emotions yours control you
you bright enough to know when you get impulsive
for me thats repulsive how do you not know this
and then we go our separate ways
just to link back on better days
though i know its short term and you never stay
you always a sucker for that text that say

yeah and so the pussy aint enough now
they keep thinkin it should be enough how
fuck sex baby later for that
this mind game im playin is a greater climax
not a franchise player i cant pay you the max
i cant say it to you so i just say it in raps
i got a rep that i made all by myself
one i hate all by myself
that comes from decisions created all by myself
i cant shake it all by myself
see i grew up in the spotlight
where your every move is eyed
the truth becomes lies when youre that scrutinized
no mentorship i was unsupervised
had to learn on my own every rule to survive
still i manned up in caught those wrongs
go ahead and judge joe i got my court clothes on
yall see the front behind the scenes more goes on
check my back catalog its in all those songs forreal
so i can be at peace forever
i left the puzzle right there nigga piece it together
but back to you beauty small waist fat booty
its cool for the moment but dont permanently move me
they come through tossin me ass like its their duty
but who i was aint who i am i say it truly
here i am shootin em down without the uzi
unlike them niggas you know dont try and group me
watched myself on tv was unruly
how the fuck they cast me wrong in my own movie
they say you are what you attract
here i am screamin fuck all that
then im forced to believe i attract and adore
bunch of unstable broads with character flaws
with plenty luggage i greet em with their bags at the door
if thats true then its some shit id rather ignore
cause check it whatever helps you get by
so when they hit me i always reply

just where im at lately
look at the monster this industry done made me
shit i loved the most i let it jade me
cryin out for help somebody save me
but i cant let em know all that
they take it as weakness when you show all that
so i just live in my mind til this hoe call back
every time im knocked down you see joe crawl back forreal
nowadays they all the same
enhanced body parts smaller brains
they dont get a hi in fact
mums the word baby girl its now quiet for that forreal
if you got nothin to offer
sorry mrs jackson gotta off ya
but as soon as you leave em alone
its when they send that same text to the phone


okay the waits up waited up really dont know where to start
niggas fresh home want me dead and gone im darin yall
its in arms reach when im sleep im prepared for yall
niggas bleed big agrees aint nobody scared of yall
besides let me summarize they aint got to wherewithal
im every where they never there when im gon hear from yall
yall know me as joe dont wanna see me as mouse
let me address all these rumors so they dont leave out the house
i mean it started with clue thats when the bullshit begun
i was the best in my city niggas knew i was the one
aint have a dime to my name still niggas thought that i won
and niggas that never did it want to tell me how it was done
im hearin some wanna clap they dont fuck with me nigga
they say i never go back well thats a luxury nigga
its somethin i can afford so what they say get ignored
they pray im on the wrong end of that ford

okay lets start it from scratch put it all on line
my characters been defamed i put it all online
told em thats where we were headed said i was wrong all the time
and now we finally here i waited a long ass time
been called every name in the book been a liar a deceiver
a cheater a woman beater am i all am i neither
been absorbin the ether robbin paul to pay peter
high price to pay to strangers i been offering me to
ive been more than a leader even with my back to the wall
thought i was finished forever when i was practicin falls
now you second guessin yourself you gotta ask what you saw
they fishin wishin its fiction but aint no actin at all
cant even fathom the gall they mad im appalled
too much passion to call nothin but bars aint no fashion involved
how is path aint adored
how the fuck they laughin i can blast through the door
aint fathom havin so much cash in the drawer
first they love me and then they hate me then they love me again
first its lovely and then its ugly then its fuck me again
bitches dont text back and then they suck me again
but still its none of my business what they think of me again
when we talk about skill they just love again
i call em out for the kill they just doubt me again
but i was born for the storm i mean abnormals the norm
maybe they wanna know how long will they mourn

im wishin this was a dream maybe its smoke in this mirror
wish i could change it all just by blowin smoke in the mirror
been such a long ride wishin i was on the side
to get caffeine pills to stay awake with sean price
if i was by eric garner id have yelled at the pigs
gave him all my cash he wouldnt have to sell that cig
shout to bobbi kristina let her know that i love her
wish she was alive or didnt die the same as her mother
maybe my thinkin is off when i blink i get thoughts
of bullets shakin the door and tape around chinx porsche
see it damaged my heart id be right in yams car
to get the purp out his cup and get his hands off the bar
tell stack that i miss him see we losin a lot
i wanna hear from shakir i still miss stuart scott
chris lighty robin williams still to this day
i pray nobody ever feel that way too many men die


i would ask how we ended up here but i drove
and you allowed me
or maybe its only me that remembers it
cause youre so easily told about me
but not once while we were on that road did you doubt me
played your position writin out our books
i noticed a page missin blame it on the age difference
i see you in the club now days youre resistant
you used to get excited just to never pay admission
lookin for the old you wishin shit was normal
tried to mold you and you ended up with it on you
live around the corner yeah we aint even formal
so im askin god why you alive and i gotta mourn you
word i see you got a little crew now
a bunch of ugly broke bitches i know better than
and i aint tryna say them hoes usin you
well actually who would i be kiddin yes i am
i see your life from far and somethings off with it
its my fault and shit i shoulda never altered it
i sold a dream when you couldnt have known the cost of it
knew my love came with a pain and i still offered it
seein your weight loss knowin im the cause of it
if that aint my signature then shit somebody forgin it
but you think i aint hurt like it aint no guilt in me
like it aint killin me im out here on a killin spree
a sickness i aint found a way to nurse it yet
internal bleedin and the cuts run deep
every time i leave one love a loved one leaves
i wish i could take the pain away but only yours
ill be fine if i remain this way
see i deserve whatever punishment i get
you could sentence me to years
of hearin my vics voice even when nothin is there

i done gone so long not givin a fuck
that its no longer erratic now its a normal habit
even when i go my way i gotta have it
bury me with my sweats on and bitches in the casket
all the waiters and words i let em loom on
and so you know how real that paranoia be
even make me think my demise is avoidin me
the sick part is i withstand that abuse
long as the fans are amused am i a man or a muse
never sugarcoat it when i hand it to the youth
fell from all over the world and always landed in the booth
i hold music in such a high regard that
to this day i still feel like its destiny
and to these fans that i once gave my life for
i gotta tell you that its not much left in me
yeah and not that its growin old
but years of bearin my soul is takin its toll
took a father from his son but is it best that way
im so fucked up inside i cant regret that trey
hold my head up high at the gates after my times up
they say you saved somebodys life by givin mine up
wouldnt be the first time that i went without
chased my true love so much that i resent it now
you can put this in the scriptures like its sacred
to live with it but hate it is to giveth then to take it
goin through the motions itll strip a nigga naked
i guess its for a cause if all the kids are gonna play it
trust me i aint been the same yet
youll stop and stare any time you see a trainwreck
and ill take whatever punishment they give
you can sentence me to years
of hearin that fans voice even when nothin is there

im tried of feeling this
i gotta live with this


you aint gotta adore me or keep it friendly
and even if you aint for me dont be against me
your people tell you ignore me and say it simply
but you get lonely and call me that always tempts me
we get caught in the moment and then we fall back
then i get horny and you take that as a crawl back
now theres an irony hidden if you can call it that
i walk all over you yet you be on my doormat
and unbeknownst to you that whole plan of attack
she sayin only with me does her sanity lack
her truth come out when she drunk but i amnesty that
i talk logic and she screamin profanity back
now when i think long term you cant hand me that
but for now she need a crutch
there i am to take advantage of the handicap
just me givin you truth i dont demand it back
guess im just a fan of facts hope you understandin that

check it im like royalty around yall
down to fall with niggas i feel as loyal as me
which is prolly why loyalty is my downfall
got few friends that be coyin me to count more
but steel sharpens steel let me sound off
still gotta question your will and what youre down for
its real i question your wheels wish they was round more
the ilk of your found cloth are you built for the downpour
all i try to do is lead by example
seems some are content with niggas feedin them a sample
tried to create a path know the streets can be a handful
me i made it out without degrees on the mantle
itll never mean the snakes and all the leeches i can handle
the bond is broke now i believe its gettin trampled
gotta pick up your pants wear your creases like a man do

its been weeks now maybe we both feel so weak now
times past should be cool for us to speak now
and you got so much pride was no surprise
i had to reach out shit you used to creep through my house
outside of bein fine i always said you was cool
you would leave in time to get your son ready for school
and ill admit that was admirable
suckin me off every night without you ever losin sight of what you had to do
fucked for seven months straight shit was magical
you broke it off over shit that wasnt factual
how could i fuck with you
with you actin so gullible and all im reluctant to move forward
you fell in love with me quick was down to wait for me
but that held us down was like a weight for me
you wanted answers
said we cant keep fuckin without a title you wont sit back idle
and to me it was intangibles
reasons i couldnt be the man for you
part of why a nigga ran from you
part of why i was passive and dismissive
why we had that awkward goodbye and i aint fix it
why i let your bimmer pull off and i aint miss it
i lied cause the truth was really none of your business
i felt like the hostings was a hoe thing
late nights strip clubs really the whole thing
but thats my own baggage in fact
plus you slept with other rappers at that
just some shit that tamed my own brain this is after the fact
its my bad not yours i know the past is the past
im hopin alls forgiven you not stuck in that time
maybe we can fuck one last time im playin with you
heres to bein grown and communicatin issues
we was never together but a nigga stayin with you

parks let me get one more

i remember it like it just happened
scratch that cant dismember it it just happened
funny how one deathll let these mishaps in
thats exactly whats about to occur
i defer heres the stinger
im right where i grew up and lost my finger
how we let it all linger
whole family in black where you used to reside
all here to say our final goodbyes
them to you me to them
my thought with every tear that i cried
whole mornin i was mournin family that had survived
now that you are gone you took with you all of the magic that you performed
and so our issues of a much deeper root is born
the weight fell dont know who its on
and since our glue is gone this is how we movin on
truth in song all quiet like the mute is on
speak to me from heaven above if im doin this wrong


look you liked me better before you knew my history
before you knew who i was
thats when reachin our potential felt likely
nobody like me
besides see if i stop bein who i am
im straight to it who i might be
but you gotta look inside each song
thats where i proved it was really in sight all along
bear it all so the privacy gone
grab the pen sit down and write these wrongs
just how i right these wrongs but look
you liked me better when i spoke usin censorship
before you knew i was really insensitive
that was back when it was you and me
then curiosity killed you you had to google me
now i wont call the headlines a liar
some are true and some are false thats for yall to decipher
but look on rare occasions some of what they sayll bother me
i liked it better when the net was still a novelty
cause now people who aint found themselves
get an outlet yet dont know how they sound themselves
they like me better when im silent and dont have an opinion
pretendin to blend in like im a minion
say if joe keep talkin that shit hell get him shot
but if rappers cant tie my shoes how can i not
thought i had my citys support i couldnt believe
jersey city liked me better when i couldnt leave
i take it back that aint set in stone
they more so had weapons drawn cause i left alone
i liked it better when i had nothin to lose
the days when i felt like i had somethin to prove
shit even for me thats unusual
if you dont give a fuck then who you gotta prove it to
just the world that i was born in
you gotta learn to form wins against the storm wind
they like me better when i fuck and never call again
without it they dont know what type of box i belong up in
they like me better without reality television
guess they didnt need to witness the hell i was livin
in my shoes you too would seal a fate
poppin twenty pills a day somebody gon feel a way
look uh and so these hoes just to pass time
after the past time they dont even pass my mind
you liked me better way before you got lied to
but that dont really matter when you want me inside you
your friends sayin leave they dont know that you tried to
you cant speak to them im the nigga you cry to
i liked it better when nobody ever heard of me
fore pop had to get that knee surgery
guess that affected his bladder
so when jackie called me nothin else really mattered
was scared sounded frantic i aint want no parts of that
said the ambulance came might be a heart attack
was leavin work nearly cryin on the phone
im in rush hour traffic just seen you dyin alone
look i just pictured all the places that we never went
all the texts that were never sent
all the words we never spoke
time we never shared rewind so we can repair
such an inspiration all the holes that you dug through
then you got released god was watchin above you
im thinkin you healin i dont wanna disrupt you
so im right back to never tellin you that i love you
and i dont wanna act that way
if i take somethin for granted i dont wanna give it back that way
forreal thats how shit get lost let me chill
i like it better when im not talkin over my thoughts now listen

now the singers wanna rap the rappers wanna sing
personally i liked it better back when rappin was a thing
cause now if you wanna get the high notes


i let the man have a talk with the beast in me
im holding onto my last bit of decency
i need a vacay a change of scenery
but mama said wherever ima go im taking me with me
i told her shit is on my mind and its been eating me
she got me pissing in a cup she dont believe in me
its not the drugs that got me out of my zone
going days without eating in a crowd i feel alone mama
then she ask why it seems i never sleep at night
i told her when i close my eyes my brain just keeps the fight
she said my friends wanna have an intervention with me
i speak to niggas daily that was never mentioned to me
she told me theres a higher power and a lower power
and that ill die if i dont find the strength to overpower
then i replied well arent we all
she said yeah but that should be on gods terms not yours

tryin to weather the storm
i thought that black cloud was gone
its been beside me all along not the song
i wanna sit in silence dont speak for a minute
tired of being strong please let me be weak for a minute
kinda thought that my disease tried to kill your man first
it was easy to get my hands on thirty milligram percs worse
cant be depression couldnt have it this long
so many secrets i only told to a glass of patron my nigga
guess im insanitys definition
trying to step over in sanitys repetition
but i cant it got me tripping
whatever love we had was dead that night
looking back we both needed cooler heads that night
was going off no sleep eyes red that night
while you was drunk texting me i hope i read that right
you was beefing bout giselle beefing bout alexa
suddenly you was jealous mustve thought that i had sexed her
i was laughing thought it was funny
giselles the homie alexas twenty
with hip withdrawals
nothing bout your story shoulda been sticking at all
i wouldnt dick her at all
im guessing maybe you were insecure and never knew me
was there for four months yet you said this was a new me
in your head guess the answer to this jealousy
was to turn around and try to make me jealous b
but the part that you neglect
was never mind jealousy this was bout respect
yall instagramming pictures trying to get me upset
you turned that into a night we both would never forget
we both said some things we both probably regret
you was lying to my face and them dots didnt connect but cool
only picked you up to try and talk sense into you
now im fucking homeboy up just off the principle
i guess he caught him self antagonizing me
but hes a young nigga thats no surprising me
shit i done fucked some of the baddest hoes
i left shorty weeks ago you can have this ho
i guess the part where i lose
is now they got my face plastered all over the news im being falsely accused
and i dont understand was this all part of a plan
i guess ill tell the whole truth when on the stand
how you go and tell the cops i had guns in my house
now they got a search warrant just to come to my house
question were your feelings worth taking my tomorrows kid
and you know jersey gun laws im talking hollow tips
so you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want
but you and i know whats going on
nigga that whole night just replays in my mind
your face is fine this is a big waste of time
lets get back to that jealousy
now you got a nigga facing three felonies
all for what cause we were no longer dealing
you attack me but im the villain over a fucking iphone and feelings
check you never see me act like a jerk
i know women will provoke you and get mad when it works
rather reserved and that always makes matters the worst
cause i go on about my business and not act like it hurts but wait
so now the whole world is watching me get burned here
which is fine theres a lesson to be learned here
which is only fuck with strippers and the bartenders
anytime theres a pole in the bar centered
so even though its from afar now
i still wish you the best i know your hearts tender
im sorry all i just got my own scars to tend to
signing off truly yours with love gods sinner


another collar another dollar
lifes short but we live it cause we gotta
another day another blessing for a scholar
school of hard knocks just reppin my alma mater
that was back when i aint have shit
god on my shoulder with the devil on the ad libs
had to think some decisions through
when times hard who the fuck you gon listen to
toilet by the bunk put you in a different mood
locked up thanksgiving eatin prison food
back on the ropes wont see a nigga budge
no bail for a felon so you gotta see the judge
they used to call us all lost niggas
had the same dreams to make it til we lost niggas
some was married to the game i divorced quicker
but i cant judge one day ill see the lord with you

yeah im just tryna make it
note from the marshall you cant even borrow
and its sad cause they comin with the padlock tomorrow
and for you to blame the world gotta blame yourself too
cause everybody feel you but nobody can help you
bad thought get in your head then you loop it
stress build up then you do somethin stupid
put a mountain in front of you you just try to move it
count on one hand the couple niggas you cool with
either they aint pickin up or they aint got it
you learn the hard way when your actions are idiotic
product of your environment and youre the product
home invasions niggas is gettin tied up
this is goin through your head while youre in the bullpen
backed into the spot but you shouldve pulled in
first nigga move and youre on him
but youre really prayin for a rr in the morning

they say tomorrow aint promised most nights i aint want it to be
nah a nigga couldnt front it to me
too many nights for dinner i just ate an uncomfortable sleep
had to open up the oven for heat
i was a born loser thoughts of a sinner
only made it out cause i fought like a winner
threats all my life im good was all talk though
death around the corner all you gotta do is walk slow
land of the haves and have nots
gun tucked better to have it than to not
try to make it out but crabs are in the lot
thatll plot so if you take a stab youll get shot
look im just proof a couple niggas said a prayer for me
wasnt fair for me god had to bear with me
nothin to live for didnt have a care with me
suicidal had my mama sheddin tears for me
cause my son might need me
life is hard but dyin is easy
i thank god every day that i awake
i avoid another funeral a homi or a wake
i escape from niggas that lived through it
better days ahead we just gotta get to it


what if the hunger was missin what if the passion was gone
if were truthfully speakin never saw it lastin this long
if the words didnt rhyme what would i do for a livin
but ive been dead for so long i figure im due for some livin
they only see the effects never pay no mind to the cause
my thinking is so complex simplicity can get lost
what if everybody was real and i wasnt surrounded by frauds
the moral in that is so priceless just cause i know what it costs
lookin back damn near every problem i had it
never got em retracted
i combat it problematic every problem of an addict
but thats just the way the cards fell
heartfelt but can you be cheated if god dealt
fuck this shit only regret that i have is ever bein regretful
i mean they all tried to kill me none of them were successful
a few i knew for some years some never met me and tried
but you cant kill nothin thats ready to die

and now im feelin like steven when he was up in that hospital
nigga shot him nine times they got him thinkin illogical
crippled feelin immortal he cheated death he unstoppable
he just want that revenge nigga feel like dyings impossible
they want me to regress like i aint been through the worst
instead of me bein blessed they want me pinned in that dirt
if you knew me in the past you would think my winnings deserved
they never noticed my path and all the sins i did first
both my parents did drugs see they put them syringes to work
and i carry that same exact gene but i never mention im cursed
those prescriptions were murder i blame it all on that nurse
she started my relapse way back i developed a thing for them percs
them fuckin pills tried to kill me none of them were successful
i close my hands on my knees send these words to the sky
you cant kill nothin thats ready to die fuck this shit

see im so self destructive hurt anyone that come near
done it my whole career was always one of her fears
hurt her so much in the past im supposed to be healin her
but she love me so much she say that its only killin her
now she say she cant watch it pill poppin its toxic
promised her i would stop it just go hide when i pop it
its a shame we can never be the same wasnt prideful
how can i tell you im nowhere near finished from bein suicidal
baby that wasnt me just some nigga that smelled like me
fuck like you stuck by some nigga that felt like me
you watched me lose weight you just waited there helplessly
you just offerin help to me i just dissed the shit selfishly
when you left i condemned you really i should commend you
not for havin that in you but for havin the strength to
i make amends to you now you shouldnt have seen me that high
i killed you when you wasnt ready to die


my condolences my condolences
whole family in mourning send my condolences
my condolences crazy i just spoke to him
courtney dropping drinks all in hooters
she losin focus shit

cause all summer sixteen aint heard a hot sixteen bout all summer
awareness is high say attention im seeking
since im reaching its offensive theyre convinced im a demon
such a thin disagreement son my kin for a reason
killing you is expected of me i dont win an achievement
somebody pinch me im dreaming take this mental reprievement
since i know the nigga i know this aint the man that im seein
i heard it straight from the bamas mouth he wont pull a hammer out

to get in a nigga ass on these beats like a thong   pause
veterans co sign me the up and comers scared
the pretty girls go papi heres my underwear

but in less than a hundred bars i knew id be a factor

forever stay violent better stay silent
hammers stay humming like strumming the mandolin violin

so they wonderin whys he so mad at the world
i take it out on tracks i rip it

i insist your men just do your best bush rendish

nigga i could fit your house in my condo
i walk around like ratchets been legalized
just me and the desert eagle and an eagle eye
closed casket now you having a boxed wake
zipper over your head dudes callin you crotchface
so yall could bump swag like us
but the next time raps discussed add this as a plus
dont nobody hit the pad like us
and would get up in that ass but the fags might bust
and since poppin tags is a must
i hit the bank all i do is withdraw
chicks removin their drawers now your crew is in awe
how you ball your jewels from a cubicle in the mall
you gon need another processor to process it
ill set it i said it
so keep running around hot headed til you get hot leaded
til everything but your torso on you is prosthetic
digest it niggas is pie thetic
rap what you cant afford yall must got credit
all you gotta know is crooked i royce bless and joell
with joe spell no l


same characters but the shows different
just listen it feels like the soul went missing
i remember copping that compact disc just to take off the wrapping
it was more then rapping
read credits till every names embedded
one day im a be just like them bet it
one day im a come and lace the team
with their favorite things when i grace the screen coasting
i mean its nothing like what i was hoping
no emotion we just going through the motions
i used to watch the videos just to see the new shit
wanted to see it first i thought id be exclusive
remember getting hyped off my first casio
acappella no beat and a bad flow
damn i miss the good ol days when we had soul

i remember each day putting my fav song on replay
but my tape deck would always eat tapes
id put my finger in the middle trying to fix it
just for the shit to end up sounding twisted
pressing clothes before school i was matching
liked the girl in class got mad when she was absent
wasnt a baller and i aint have no game
so what could i do besides ignore her
ormy first fight with no brothers to get
i remember being scared as shit and he had all this lip
and i aint have hands not a bit
just knew that i aint wanna get hit
so staring at the clock i aint trying to see three oclock hit
but i never found the back door
him he ended up with a tapped jaw
as for me i ended up with that bad broad
damn i miss the good ol days i wish we had more

maybe im feeling like a kid today
i mean i used to want to have a house party watching house party kid  play
i had the low tops kicks and the fades
i remember my first piece of ass from a hot chick
surprised she gave it to me was shocked i got it
ol girl image of me was all ruined
had to be thinking the fucks this boy doing
so hard i flirted just to be all nervous
wish she could see me now im so perverted
i tell her im so glad i found you
are you ready for round two or can i mount you
in old pics i used to look like a clown dude
when i had know idea what id amount to
a nigga used to be out of control
man i miss the good ol days when we had soul


l look look
comin up used to grab the pound for a dollar
fuckin with that water you get drowned somethin proper
he act like an inmate but sound like a scholar
i mean   hoppin out chain danglin poker grill
sober still except for an occasional dose of pills
show the steel all of it til its overkill
for oprah bills ill turn this bitch into cloverfield
i understand why niggas aint tryin to bond with me
fresh as a fuck ery day is like the prom for me
rappers aint fond of me frruck them my mantra be
the games fixed anyway   and you could ask tim donaghy
im on some all kinda weed sleep where the piranhas be
and honestly  im erything dudes be tryin to be
i get money and haul off
while they at rock bottom the poor guys cant even fall off
im all spartan avoid the four sparkin
cause erything is funny til a niggas george carlin
not greedy i just want a portion of the fortune
if all rappers do is record why would i call em
look i aint heard of that
and these haters killin me softly
but i dont mind takin on robertas flack
im known to one point eight seven murder tracks
go and tell whoever wan know the king of jerz is back


see i dont trust no one
so stubborn i could dream a thousand paths wake up and walk a old one
and i follow wherever it take me
instead of wherever the crew go like tray lee
they see distinguished
i see a nigga erasing that fine line between crazy and genius
got the jewels out see im on my colorado shit
id rather put the suit on and not follow it
everything is perception  everything is deception
but niggas fuck with him cause i be the exception
i got a warm reception way before any song hit
i think too outside of the box to be cornered
im too real to be fickle
grounded but too fly to meet a nigga in the middle too big to be belittled
wise way beyond my years heres the motto of a man child
why try to fit in when you a standout

uhh you in that mood yet why not

look they said i had to make music that would have the kids fiending screaming
make nothing with a meaning  i aint know the meaning
they told him go hollywood
for a split second thought i probably could
but parlayed on would i be understood
they told me even if you not able to cop cable
anytime you hit the club you better have a table
told me they would take me at my worst
told me image is everything so i told em id obey my thirst
told me do what you gotta once you on
hit the scene make it rain i told em im already in the storm
everythings in a uproar
they told me front i said what for
said it again i said fuck yall
i wont succumb to all the stereotypes
wont sacrifice me for what the stereo hypes
they told me get in where you fit in this is whats in demand now
so i told em why try to fit in when you a standout

i understand somethings off about me  but nothings forced bout me
i never gave a fuck of what a nigga thought about me
i look down upon what some see as a must
maybe im regular and the world needs to adjust
i mean im everyday people hood but still formal
im normally abnormal taking life as a lesson
ill leave the past in the past tomorrows not promised
and todays just a gift i guess thats why its the present
did i outgrow me or shit just didnt stick
the baggier my jeans the more shit didnt fit
didnt quit inspired by hate even with homeless
when you a star you already down with the joneses
my thoughts out loud
sometimes if the leader walk slow enough he fuck around get lost in the crowd
but he aint gotta speed up everything will pan out
cause theyll spot you from far when you a standout


whatever happened to that
joey yeah
seems like i gotta by the end of the week
i think it mighta been next week
mighta been next month shit

look sometimes i wanna make money
but sometimes i aint motivated sometimes i think its overrated
sometimes im thinkin i wasnt supposed to make it
but what i show is basic i normally poker face it
sometimes i wanna make music
sometimes i think its just useless
so yall dont hear a lot of new shit
clueless dependin on what my mood is
sometimes i wanna dress down
i mean i wanna let up but yall be let down
im so easily sidetracked
i just lost my train of thought but besides that
i wanna stop somebody and keep it real
but know that theyll understand fore i tell em how i feel
i wish i knew how to feel
i swore i needed somethin from the store
got a call that i just ignored my day is hectic
im overwhelmed with thoughts leave a message
this saturday i planned on goin shoppin for my kid
wanna smoke no cigs im like where the fucks the store
got a migraine but i forgot that i was sick
cause these jeans dont seem to lay right over my kicks
and thisll be the last time i buy this brand
that i try this brand   oh shit the bitch called me
she seems like the perfect girl to cheat with
sleep with i bet that she can keep a secret
i turned the radio on and heard a beat sick
know i can kill that shit better than he did
sometimes i could be so analytical
with no audience so who am i a critic to
i spent years tryin to figure out why is that
beat of my drum thrown off by a hi hat
i should hit the club get a outfit
but fuck that the lifestyle aint about shit
that no longer gets me up it dont arouse shit
see im on my ondemand in the house shit
ive lost so many relationships
is it just because i dont relate to shit
me i  i hate ignorance so much
im prayin for niggas that didnt grow much
maybe our whole generation was raised wrong
im only responsible for me i gotta stay strong
 why but besides that

uh uhh im so easily sidetracked
uhh goin on nigga i spent years tryin to figure out why is that
why i mean im so easily sidetracked
fuck is goin on

yo cigs still unlit lookin a pic of a man cross eyed
on my way to kill the nigga til the thought died
or its a lie im just hogtied
got frog eyes cause chick with a phatty walked by
nice complexion nice tan
and so behind her i ran til i seen her desination was a man
in the street i stand with my heat in hand
for what reason i dont remember beefin
note to self on my hand get even
but i dont remember needin re venge
now anybody comin toward me im reachin
leg bleedin    fuck it
ill retrace my steps followin the path of my blood leakin
led me to juans house which i visit every weekend
to my knowledge me and him wasnt speakin


joey uhh

you know i keep somethin pretty by me
good pair of frames polo white tee
yall see somethin with a body have her my queen

cause you aint coco and i aint ice t
so its unlikely i trick on her tryin to ball
tattoo on her back said china doll
joey talk to em like imus yall
and give head to a brother need a tylenol
and lets keep what we do on the low
no entourage just a one man show
i mean ive been seen the broad you just met her
im in the tel with her you just text her
you just chase her you just sweat her
she played you out you just let her
you just peck her you protect her
i dont even understand them gestures
i undress her throw her on the dresser
normally the room like like esther
but if she act up gotta check her
rl next her thats just my regular
et cetera my service like federer
the rodger cat now do you roger that
lets keep what we do on the low
how you doin tonight
matter fact what you doin tonight
if the answers nothin
im hopin us two could get into somethin
so let me know what you doin tonight
or maybe im what you doin tonight
call me up naked when she home alone
and make the tone long now thats the phone bone
look   i aint gotta compliment you
uhh me bein me compliments you
so on the balcony or in the tub
on the plane join the mile high club
from the club to the bathroom stall


first off im not competin im more like stampedin im more like steamrollin
more like puttin my foot on the neck of the game until i see it chokin
i hold on for dear life  the flow is air tight and the bars are bar none
regarded as the one fuck music its a art to son
lets rewind see i was born in the projects left for a new hood
jetted to a new state lookin for a new pace
diamond in the rough i stood out amongst the fugaz
swear a friend a mine headlined every news page  with dreams of bein wealthy
you now checkin out the new jersey version of peter petrelli
but wait with a little travis barker on the side
cause when it all falls down i normally survive
im tryin to see a new tax bracket so ill never have to grab matics
i aint concerned with no rap racket
so yall could take my name through the mud and drag it
spread it to the masses  i still play it passive
i got no choice but walk around with the lead on me
life is way too short too many dead homies
plus with all the money i invest everyday a nigga die for less
so if a nigga wanna go to war wave hi to death
i mean he lives right next to me so he aint a threat to me

damn right im on my grind

im still livin life in the fast lane
still plottin on my big money scheme like he wesley and woody thinkin
how to rob a cash train
shittin on hoes thatll act vain
til the whole world know his last name
still spit like it aint no tomorrow
it aint over yall underrated so i overcharge
old dodge radio off fuck a station
get to know me through the music not a publication
its no justification  i mean enough with the waitin
i lost all my trust and my patience
that came without the crown or the chair or the robe
nigga i dont care what you sold
they let the beast out of the cage look at the hunger
got yourself into some shit look at the plunger
im talkin cause im livin it
entrepreneur steve rifkind shit though a few haters wanna hinder it
im comin with some different shit
and these offices all about my paper thats that dunder mifflin shit
rapper on roids sick with the thoughts
but managed to keep my name out the mitchell report
see im a inspiration for a whole generation
even when im gone but my message in syndication
then you too can attain the unattainable
but fuck tryin to explain the unexplainable


still regular just stuck in a rappers body
made some bread off this shit but still raps a hobby
i never got an invite i had to crash the party
now its just models inside im at the after party
i set trends heres somethin for the fags to copy
suc ceed and everybody from the past gets salty
i get in the booth and own that bitch
wont stop til all my brothers are jonas rich
or wealthy not rich fuck it see i aspire to be mr buffett
warren not from just tourin
i used to grind hustle hard for some hot jordans
til my mind went beyond and all that got borin
the streets watchin but its outlook is not important
im tryin to pocket a fortune without the stocks soarin
if you aint into gettin paper let it be
just know we too parallel to every meet think about it now

they say he cant come to the hood he got ran out
hows he livin so good his money shouldve ran out
figured hed be thirsty for a hand out
or livin at his mans house none of that ever panned out
call him fake ass
say he as fake as his girls fake ass
say we dont hear him on the radio and he aint been out in so long
dude cant even rap you couldnt be so wrong
got a different type of censorship
so whatever im blessed with i dont mention it
that shit is soft
and my motto is when you get inside the end zone act like youve been there before
says somethin about your character to always brag
so if you never had act like you always have for real
heres somethin to adhere to be careful
cause with so much dick in your mouth its hard to hear you pause

look they say dont argue with fools me i do it for debate sake
im the nigga that embrace hate
take a minute think about how much ya cake weigh
then know im on your mind havin a great stay
actually i hope to never have to vacate
you see im much more vaca than ak
how you premeditate hate
at least have the balls to nay say when a nigga face to face
lets see if you still wanna disrespect the king savior


mic check mic check mic check mic check
mic check one two one two

old head said reality is fake and fakes the new real
nothing prescribed to me but taking a few pills
aint trying to be the dude thats raising the blue steal
vics help me escape they give me a new feel
unedited ayday is a newsreel some cake and a few bills
honestly all itll take is a few mill
for me not to have to portray no true skill
but lemme just watch what i say the truth kills
be careful what you wish for
if im totally ignored i might withdraw
i used to be pissed off piss poor
money chris paul  like this short
it was kinda hard to get the whole puzzle working with half a jigsaw
i got mine let me help you get yours without getting ripped off
i left a trail nigga follow it
and when its gone make a new one dont remodel shit
oh

make your own motherfucking footsteps nigga dont follow mine
huh i got great problems though my problems are good

l look look look

new suit dude nervous
old case new judge new verdict
i feel like im a new man a new purpose
its like a nigga aint feeling so worthless
kneel down and worship all them years was worth it
so when he opened his mouth i was stunned
he said you cant deny man his son be clear
so if he wanna be there you let him be there
be fair i mean i can see he wants to be near
i can see that he cares
ill lock your ass up you dont oblige beware
she stared she scared
my lil dude always get the world from me
and you want him to have the world just not from me
back like i never left was never forced away
got nothing more to say oh

when i see you im disgusted
cant believe i was ever in love wit
mustve been dusted cause you look like shit
all these years they aint done you no justice
i mean you all fucked up cant get cash
still bitter over a past you cant get passed
just sad get mad cause my bitch bad
ayday she switch heels switch bags
its like we living on a dock nigga big pad
you cant afford a deposit on my closet
since you all i ever known was fly shit
unfortunately you aint fitting that logic
cause youre much less
sometimes you gotta stand by your failures to recognize your success
still ill be the bigger man and wish her all the best
while knowing shell never get it
so why would she ever quit it its ridiculous


now let me ask you a question
who are you where you from what you reppin
is every bar about a burner or a weapon
and now he all gassed up by his brethren
some tell me that my music is depressin
but best rapper in the world i was destined
jump off must be the exception
am i the only one thats progressin in a recession
they tell me trickin aint trickin if you got it
when i was younger i used to get ass for sport
now im less about her sex im more into her thoughts
nah i aint mean to cross that yet i regress
im more into her thoughts on sex
and the property fuck whats across my neck
be clear im more into her career than her hair
her mind state nothin is insurmountable
im worried about her account  is she accountable
real man shit im no longer outlandish
the roof dont drop  but its panoramic
and i know haters cant stand it
so i do it on purpose still on my jerz shit
we dont fall flat and we never cave in
i lead pressure right to my doormat
all that adversity never worried me
if anything it feeds me itll nourish me
i try to keep it a hundred non fiction
lane switchins in my true religion with the double stitchin
no fitted t kid robot
these rap niggas is ass and i dont dig botox
into enterin clubs dodgin photogs
so they can talk shit about me for a whole blog
go hard no prob thats the plan
i might laugh and joke son but im a grown ass man ya heard


i must admit im kinda freaked out dont see what the big deal is all about
one day it wont hurt but im not to that stage i think in time ill start to act my age and step into the story where anything goes its always been this way i suppose hoping im doing all right i take my bows and bask in the light of the unknown
this will be my saving grace that somewhere in the human race theres a girl who can replace you   just a simple cut and paste   then i see your face where will i ever find another girl like you
i must concede that ive been misled missing you keeps messing with my head but when im alone i kind of freak out knowing what the big deal is about   ill step into the story where anything goes its always been this way i suppose hoping im doing all right ill take my bows and bask in the light of the unknown


my story my pain cant ail it
my tears overflowed you cant pale it
my talent too immense cant jail it
niggas tried to cross the god but they aint nail it
my path my walkway you cant trail it
my ladder my mountain cant scale it
its my life my struggles cant help it
im just grateful that he kept me alive for me to tell it
check it see the music industry changed me
it was everything that id have never guessed it was
so my discography is all full of hand me downs
i couldnt figure out another way to dress it up
nah no one know me better than this mic and this booth
its no better way i owe my today to my yesterdays
you live with regrets probably die with em too
so i trust god more than myself im tryna tell ya
drunk in the basement now im in the wine cellar
i learned to never let the fear settle in
and now im more prepared than ive ever been
not one ounce of hate in my glass
just one of the things og taught me way in advance
said its two types of folk in this world
got the ones thats out doin it and those busy sayin they cant

you know some niggas never learn
some learn and never apply
but wait some apply but never teach
my only right to preach i spent time being each
grab that magnifying glass i need yall to look closer
at the only dude to do every drug and get lower
if niggas knew a third of all the weight that he shouldered
theyd know it an insult to think im only bipolar
i got a unique talent dont know how i obtained it
how do i sustain it cant even explain it
so youll never be alone again
whats mine is yours you wont be without a home again
and i know you from miami so you hate the cold
but you been through much colder than me and im much older
you just ride shotgun let a nigga chauffeur
ill cut the grass you just look out for the cobras
well be just fine god set these on our shoulders
ill show you a man you showed me i could stay sober
let the world talk about every picture we post up
and well sleep well every night cause they dont know us


two years waits up still sleep wake up
dawg so lemme help niggas understand mouse
dawg why try to fit in when you a stand out
its no album but the money never ran out
aside from rap im kinda focused on land now
cause i dont know whurr the game is
i know we jus been attacked by a hurricane chris
some niggas cant fathom what money and fame is
or some niggas get it by usin they stainless
or some niggas get it but they cant sustain it
me im regular joe i dont let it change shit


some niggas wanted to kill me got locked up and never found me
so my goal is to catch a charge in that same county
picture me gettin bumped for a silly hand off
the bullpens fucked up just ask willie randolph
see i could pop a few nickel plated glocks too
its easier to kill niggas than it is not to
i let the pot brew then the plot grew
it the labels job to label you dont fit it and theyll drop you
finally made a move on something i been saw
sometimes you got to lose the fight
if you tryin to win the war im focused on tomorrow
im done seein my friends in the rearview thinkin we really closer than we are
fuck the record label
no relation or correlation all my admiration just turned aggravation they say
how you sit so long when you spew classics
i tell niggas i cant understand thats that blue magic
the rap game as is either you on some snap shit
or plan ol stuck in a different decade like the brat is
i hear niggas joints and take it personal why
now everybody want to spit about their personal lives
before that was non existent
me im an addict with an addition for anything that seems to cause friction
maybe im in a relationship with bad karma
what her past the somber maybe i attract drama yeah
undoubtedly my life is on some vhone shit
just adding some salt and pepper to reality while
other artists is obsessed with more toys
like lex coup beemers and benzes    theyre lost boys
un i kept brushing off my shoulder till the chip was going
left the benz at the dealers till the kit was on
i dont feel niggas songs
so while yall at the awards
im loading up on ratches thats the tip im on
flow is on acid i swear i would have the game mastered
if i wasnt so busy carrying baggage
calling god a bastard
calvin look way different in person
then they had him looking in his casket
im looking in his casket like he had no face
i was at a lost for words like fiasco gate
so i figured i say a prayer for em got on my knees quick
and realized i dont ever pray until i need shit
my soul achin trying to stay low maintenance
im stuck in hell waiting on
blessing with no patience
i done made the ave hot
been had to stab shot
waiting on my jackpot
always been a have not
always been an under dog little guy still try
cause i think im a cash cow they treat me like im milk dry
juggling nickels and dime im walking a fine line
sometimes you got to just breath maybe give time time
give me a sign kind of shock he wont
see i want another baby but my pockets dont
normally that wouldnt bother me
till i wake up and get the paper and
read that some rich nigga won the lottery
young black and shameless
shorty keep beefing about the same shit
almost like yelling her second language
why do i entertain it
listen we been arguing about everything for ages do it ever change shit
wind up igging each other for the whole week
its a lot of men in this world baby you chose me like i chose you
we been rocking for years you signed up
you not a victim you a volunteer its weird
im not a cheater on occasion still fuck a bitch
who knows why maybe just to feel coveted
im me shes her we both had enough of it
but wont leave we the only ones who put up with it
in all areas its like my stocks crashing
wishing all these old motherfuckers would stop rapping
tryna be tasteful not mad or rageful
upset or hateful not complacent im grateful
and i dont wanna resort back to my old ways
theres no stairway to heaven less you the


we call this one send him our love
rest in peace to stack bundles


look what up ray was speechless i aint know what to say
got the call like at eight am with nate saying
you had passed away im like why niggas stay playing
your myspace page playing it started my day aching
it hit me like a tumor felt like it was too soon to
thought it was a rumor until it wasnt a rumor
cant believe that its over
but if god called you i aint even mad at him he mustve needed a soldier

i make his life inept for a pie to the neck

i a cappella the whole left side of his chest
not retiring still got that pension pending
tryna pop the hood and see the engine missing
double barrelled shotgun how your men get missing
she got pretty brown eyes and she in mint condition
oh the cig in the car you dissin moi
take the ratchet go home and just chris benoit

i could send a clique cartridge at a nemesis target
and catch a ror on some jena six charges
nah ill put this thing away i dont even need a
whole hairdo to clip em all it take is one finger wave
been in the  for days show you how im real
come home to the truck with the optimus prime grill
handed out crack got the scene poppin off
they not sleepin on em the fiends is nodding off
all real tell me how you a thug and you superman
i just seen you in the club doing the superman
a bunch of clowns homes all i
need in this world is the pound chrome huxtable brown stone
major paper cake by the layers
if these dudes is live im the create a player
they callin em kings when they so so hot
somethings wrong with that picture must be photoshopped
i dont promote violence but when sparkin the flame blame
arms start waving like the carlton banks dance
when them tools go pop it move whole blocks
come around with your dog and get kujo shot
these mcs is lame i try to be a mc with brains
these niggas is mc brains
being nice rappers is far from being nice
im on the rooftop recording niggas is being sniped
its like


the soundtrack to my life is like cnn first shit
images like cnn but worse shit
i would down the whole pinot gris
but id see the group home without the primo beats
and it hurts my soul
im a warrior so though the odds is against a nigga dirk gon choke
some people confide in the person that they sleep with
ive learned theres no such thing as a secret
i cant describe the feeling i get
you was riding shotgun i was wheeling the whip
shit i even let you rock out being bill belichick
tapin from the sidelines stealin my shit
but dawg you was like a mini me mocked me envied me
turns out you was blowin hot air kenny g
but you was cool accepted you instantly
not a groupie but you had a few tendencies
and though we share a few memories
couple wrong turnsll turn a friend to an enemy
see phony people like phony people
even you could be mistaken if you phone these people look
when you invite the nerds to the cool table
and you a little smarter than the average dude
so it took a nigga just a little longer to see
they tried to warn me fought with my girl erry night about you
shit only hurts cause she was right about you

she run around wanting to shoot you the fair one
i keep telling her chill i dont care none
i got another side i never showed to you
the side where everybody is disposable
see relationships are never a threat
cause ill erase the history and act like we never met
become done giving a fuck and done calling
i got your e mail i was done way before then

dear diary i dont wanna keep shit inside of me
id rather just speak to you privately
maybe its my mood as far as i can see
theres really no point in having this guy with me

change from the days of us getting in your truck
its bigger than one song its bigger than a buck
its bigger than me bigger than buck
bigger than voodoo its bigger than luck shit its bigger than us

i always call niggas fools for wanting to learn the hard way
when im really the fool for tryna teach em
when the blinds leading the blind you cant reach em
if niggas aint as hungry as you then why feed em
niggas aint tryna be lead then why lead em
having big problems with your dogs why breed em
ill keep my part up keep my guard up
was like thundercats but changed faster than cheetara

this a small part of a larger issue
sometimes acceptance is so hard to get to
but we all equal no one lower or above me
i love my team just as much as they love me
if not more
if i turn the knob we all going through the door i aint coming back for yall
the whole crew feel the same as me
how could you ignore something so plain to see
im being ignant that get on my nerves every minute
whats plain to some is really burberry printed

being so real sometimes is a slow kill
we was one squad you broke out like mike schofield
i want fillet mignon you want oatmeal
add up our differences equals up to no meal
no mills yup no deal why you gotta chase sht
to know its no thrills for real

a nigga still beefin with his baby momma
only thing my baby aint a baby no more
hit her on myspace maybe she aint shady no more
sent old girl a message no reply but she read it
some things are so embedded and our heads is
looking for os but get xs dealing wit ya exes
i was one long line away from the tetris
she sent me the l that sent me to hell

to the point where im denied my son
i dont see him dont talk to him i dont greet him dont walk wit him
but i pay for him like hes an object

might size you and your spouse have guys go in your house
with ridges on the nose of the rifle like alf

they say hip hop is dead or on life support
maybe not that could be something i just thought
i just ought to jump in fighting the sport
how you expect to be heard when your mic is off
i would love to go and browse through the robb report
but aint a car in that motherfucker i can afford
see niggas trying to block the road
rather then my label drop the growth they should drop us both

shallow bitches only into jewelry cars
still fuck with us though that aint who we are
soon as my wife gone they jump on the python
they aint know im out to hit and run like saigon
putting back the ice on had it screwed up
finally figured out that hate is the new love
but i dont see how you get ahead that way
when you team up with envy like red cafe
and all that blame is yours
you trying to get a chain like floss
im trying to get a chain like stores
find me in jers line for squeeze work off safety
cant keep calm around these jerks think beyond these words
treat the hood like myspace either become friends with the tommy first
so get found on the back of an empty carton
spray semi larkins for the bread like remy martin
dont mind me last of a dying breed
wanna take rap and bring it back to the ninetys
juicy inspired me cream made me angry
the mediall say anything to get at you
niggas is transparent im lookin right past you
henny is a bad dude talkin bout he act rude

hella paper tell a hater crib got a elevator
on the waterfront so yeah i oughta front

yo yo please lord somethin gotta give
they say for every negative theres a positive
but i aint positive for every buck deposited
we still in the hood livin like hostages and never mind colleges
school of hard knocks scholarship dealin with politics
i would just sell success in the store if i could bottle it
but i aint a millionaire wont see me in forbes son
life is like a  when you can afford one
ruger loaded just in case the war come
might as well everything is comin to the forefront
need a clear head just to think
and fuck a  nigga im two steps from a drink
the pressure either bust pipes or it make diamonds
no matter how high up the mountain i stay climbin
freedom i keep chancin
so if i fall like beyonce i just get back up and keep dancin


uh let me talk to em real quick la look look
im chasin after pies with bags under my eyes
you lookin at my representative mask its a disguise

certain niggas bettin i fall
im speed joggin through the quicksand im jugglin three medicine balls

long way to go i see my feet gettin blisters
i dare em talk to me like mike richards
or play don imus and think its cool to disrespect our sisters
i guess we got a while fore they actually get the picture

stuck in the everyday struggle only mines is hourly
jungle full of wolves with a few lions thats cowardly
used to make it hot even that was too mild for me
school of hard knocks tried to make the teacher proud of me
sue me script straight out of a movie
toolie wont get kicked and pushed like lupe
from groupies to housewives from scams to skirmish
from sane to loco from hustler to hermit
you let niggas plot and believe me they goin try
my nigga been shot nine times and wont die
and so death threats become death threats
when they want you on your death bed and you aint been put to rest yet
you in icu
see the gunman in your head damn cant wait til i see dude
hate hospitals i dont wanna go see dude
know i love you to death i feel its no need to
in my mind theres bloody hallways and project windows
dice games thick clouds of project indo
niggas creepin off with the project nympho
or plain clothes searching for some project info
projects i resemble so i dont stand out lookin clean cut
hangin round the project kinfolk
cutthroats and liars connects and suppliers
fiends and they buyers liquor store right by us
kicks over the wire
if you dave blaine start choking in the water send in the divers
show dudes the real definition of survivor
in my mind im butt naked walking through the fire
oxymoron stubborn as a brick yall
im a five star suite with the view of a brick wall
a high class scumbag conceited nobody
popular stranger i see shit like nobody
a tarrantino martin scorsese
coming up i was that nigga they called crazy
in my hood they like fuck em all gotta pay me
then get shot in the ass for thinking its all gravy
im on my third ci now
and my bitch running round like she a pi now
going through his phone book and his levis now
its two choices chillax or leave right now
thats how it be right now aint ya ordinary rapper dude
menace to society a nigga with a attitude
a soul of mischief i know all about that
poor righteous teacher nah more like a outcast


first off let me shout out the fam yall so gracious
been chilling in the room for growth its so spacious
getting to the money counting these old faces
like i found the smoking gun in cold cases
them dark thoughts never got to em still
im like the legendary robin will
even though i understand
i never dealt with the pain like that
a knot from that same rope
but i dont hang like that
she said she wanna set boundaries
cant continue to have you surrounding me
cause thatll lead to you on this couch pounding me
thatll bring them feelings back
thats just out of bounds to me
its been years last bitch aint come around to me
send my tone of voice down


just tryna explain the unexplainable
more than tryna attain the unattainable try and make it sustainable
collectin all the parts see if they interchangeable
killin me slow but im glad its entertainin you
everyday it amaze me
the same thinkin that pay me the same thinkin that plagues me
how can i think im crazy sway me
cause to profit off of shit that aches me is actually pretty wavy
uh im paintin the perfect picture
only perfect cause the imperfections are highlighted
to gross currency off of that kinda sickness
changes the meaning of mind my business
givin what was given to me
so the soldiers come over unsober and call me yoda instead of joseph
i be like why they come to me for advice
they should really come to me for a vice i got em all
got a counter full of liquor pocket full of pills
the illusion of control i can tell you how it feels
accounts full of paper and the women i play wit
all got criminal bodies innocent faces
come around and we have a ball could have it all
well i ran out of adderall but thats a matter of a call check it
odds is they start tellin me they hardships
regardless they end up wantin hard dick aww shit
you would think theyd been ordained
got her legs in the air she screamin the lords name
im feedin her more game more game more game
i started fuckin her mind thats when all them thoughts came
she keep sayin if i want her i should fight for her
my plight for her says i dont know if im right for her
even so know theres a fire i ignite for her
starin at her ceiling seeing me like im a nightcrawler
uh its like she love me but she dont
thats when she lose me thats when she confuse me
its what i get appalled wit cant call it
she think i should remove her hurt since i installed it
but i wish she knew i was perturbed too
birds view it hurt me more knowin i hurt you
even though it exists i dont ever bring it up
we dont be doin nothin but its everything to us
presently she bring up the past and its filthy
you not talkin to who i was or who i will be
but thats my own assignment
you wanna take all the feelings and the time spent and give it realignment
check the catalog lateral god
i self sabotage id explain further but id rather not
salute on me everybody have a shot
i do it for the niggas they said wouldnt have a shot
but some days are better than some days
still yet here i stand on numb legs
women dont give a fuck that i have these scars
im fuckin the same hoes that the athletes are
what a rollercoaster we argued and we sexed
face in her box james harden in her texts
nigga from the clippers ery mornin text her good mornin
she be sleep he just be talkin to me my nigga
none of this is a pain to see
i only care about her if she pertains to me
shit im tendin to emergencies with urgency
that urge in me is my daily fight in her purgin me
fuck hoes i aint got time to be sprung now
grandpas cancer just made it to his lungs now
in two point twelve docs gave him few months wild
hes alive somehow outlived two sons wow
so now their observation
says hell die quicker with chemo and radiation
he aint strong enough to even go through operation
know that deaths comin he just in the house waitin
so you tellin me there aint a way to fix the shit
or is grandpa too old for you to give a shit
lets switch the shit give you my predicament
wonder how you would feel if i was tellin yours live with it
and its travelin to his heart soon
of course it all hit me like a harpoon
i was in shock and then it was all clearer
when he called me and asked me to be his pallbearer
i was floored
but then the next second was back to being self centered self absorbed
and it became about me fought it off long enough
i could help carry your weight but i aint strong enough
but why do i have to be
this the shit i be naturally askin me im such a catastrophe


i got strangers in my face
beggin me to take a picture
still self centered they can give a fuck bout how a nigga feel
bitches hang around to hang around even when shit get real
but i aint left nothin maybe i should write a different will
they usin me im usin them they dont see the angle
therapeutic i dont even fuck em unless its painful
why do all these bitches seem to think they can change joe
judge me all you want i never claim to be an angel
patriotic psychotic obsessive compulsive convulsive neurotic
on narcotics searchin for you if you got it
seein young blacks gettin killed weekly thats a moot fact
if these coppers shoot at me trust me imma shoot back
maybe yall ll pray for me
but i dont mean once or even twice i mean every day for me
so im on my knees theres gotta be a better way for me
open these windows and these doors but demons stay with me
and baby thats okay with me

lemme get far as fuck away from these niggas
fuck away from these hoes
where im at now its fuck music i dont wanna rap
i dont wanna perform or host
and my fathers sayin get it together and nothin matters but my health
hope heaven reserved a section for an addict like myself
watchin myself on tv see my knees shaking on that show
plus the way shortys life is now i bet shes rethinking that no
she thought she was only sayin no to marriage
but that no is to so much more now i cant wait to see what her path is
i guess being a wife aint sound as fun as bein a bad bitch
couldnt deal with my habits wasnt me though youd been catfish
were speakin a different language
showin you the signs in morse code
last time a nigga loved two bitches i lost em both
so she scared try not to get emotionally invested
i know god will find a way for those emotions to get tested
which is cool maybe not for me
front all you want in your heart somewhere
i know theres a spot for me
the sad part is when its vacant ill be gone
how i love you but i hate you
and all youre doing is being the person that i made you
from hateful to graceful
from rageful to grateful
then god came and snatched that space for you
i tried to save it boo
everything i caught myself building  to that point was made for two
writing out the script wish youd a told me the page was full
but fuck it he knows better than i
regretll subside lets sever the ties
after all its just one less goodbye

lemme get far as fuck away from these bitches
lemme get far as fuck away from my niggas
lemme get real close to my foes
they tellin me that i gotta act famous now etcetera
i been regular so i feel like an anus now
see all of this time ive just been treatin yall accordingly
on an even plane like no one is any less or more than me
but the lord agrees he said keep playin with fire if youre joseph youll get burned
i hate second guessing ill wait til the motives get confirmed
call from the shorty we off that bitch option time
models sport some
all these cities i got to tour one
all these bottles i got to pour one
all these hoes i got to call one
our situation is a tall one what you gonna do pour or run
so im spending forty thousand dollars on a time piece
help my self esteem and get this shit up off my mind please
anybody lookin for me yall know where to find me
i be right up steinway nigga i aint playing hide and seek
uhh uhh uhh
it go


i let the man have a talk with the beast in me
im holding onto my last bit of decency
i need a vacay a change of scenery
but mama said wherever ima go im taking me with me
i told her shit is on my mind and its been eating me
she got me pissing in a cup she dont believe in me
its not the drugs that got me out of my zone
going days without eating in a crowd i feel alone mama
then she ask why it seems i never sleep at night
i told her when i close my eyes my brain just keeps the fight
she said my friends wanna have an intervention with me
i speak to niggas daily that was never mentioned to me
she told me theres a higher power and a lower power
and that ill die if i dont find the strength to overpower
then i replied well arent we all
she said yeah but that should be on gods terms not yours

tryin to weather the storm
i thought that black cloud was gone
its been beside me all along not the song
i wanna sit in silence dont speak for a minute
tired of being strong please let me be weak for a minute
kinda thought that my disease tried to kill your man first
it was easy to get my hands on thirty milligram percs worse
cant be depression couldnt have it this long
so many secrets i only told to a glass of patron my nigga
guess im insanitys definition
trying to step over in sanitys repetition
but i cant it got me tripping
whatever love we had was dead that night
looking back we both needed cooler heads that night
was going off no sleep eyes red that night
while you was drunk texting me i hope i read that right
you was beefing bout giselle beefing bout alexa
suddenly you was jealous mustve thought that i had sexed her
i was laughing thought it was funny
giselles the homie alexas twenty
with hip withdrawals
nothing bout your story shoulda been sticking at all
i wouldnt dick her at all
im guessing maybe you were insecure and never knew me
was there for four months yet you said this was a new me
in your head guess the answer to this jealousy
was to turn around and try to make me jealous b
but the part that you neglect
was never mind jealousy this was bout respect
yall instagramming pictures trying to get me upset
you turned that into a night we both would never forget
we both said some things we both probably regret
you was lying to my face and them dots didnt connect but cool
only picked you up to try and talk sense into you
now im fucking homeboy up just off the principle
i guess he caught him self antagonizing me
but hes a young nigga thats no surprising me
shit i done fucked some of the baddest hoes
i left shorty weeks ago you can have this ho
i guess the part where i lose
is now they got my face plastered all over the news im being falsely accused
and i dont understand was this all part of a plan
i guess ill tell the whole truth when on the stand
how you go and tell the cops i had guns in my house
now they got a search warrant just to come to my house
question were your feelings worth taking my tomorrows kid
and you know jersey gun laws im talking hollow tips
so you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want
but you and i know whats going on
nigga that whole night just replays in my mind
your face is fine this is a big waste of time
lets get back to that jealousy
now you got a nigga facing three felonies
all for what cause we were no longer dealing
you attack me but im the villain over a fucking iphone and feelings
check you never see me act like a jerk
i know women will provoke you and get mad when it works
rather reserved and that always makes matters the worst
cause i go on about my business and not act like it hurts but wait
so now the whole world is watching me get burned here
which is fine theres a lesson to be learned here
which is only fuck with strippers and the bartenders
anytime theres a pole in the bar centered
so even though its from afar now
i still wish you the best i know your hearts tender
im sorry all i just got my own scars to tend to
signing off truly yours with love gods sinner


it go off with my sabbatical
took a few years cause slaughters what i had to do
which only brings me to now and i oughta be erratical
i say that cause my autobiographical is more so just a graph of you
i aint mad you did more than what i asked of you
as for me i did less than what i couldve
so though we were a hit had to cancel that show
and now my standards so low i be amped when she not a hoe
but what you doing right now is real commendable takes strength to do
cause between us theres some deep roots there
i gave you the best dick you ever got in your life
and stupid me thought it would be enough to keep you there
i thought you loved football i was running through the hole with the stiff arm
but got disarmed guess it was just harm
i aint need to fuck i was looking for a peer
they say once you stop looking what you looking for appears
you were stronger than i pictured you much stronger than me
and almost just as strong as john
and john oh thats just a friend of my moms
with tubes coming out his nose but shit i never knew why
but he was born with his heart on the right side of his chest
no for real his hearts in the right side of his chest
doctors confused aint much that they can do
but impute and say it aint on the right side of his chest
scared he might die in his sleep deep
every time he cough wonders if its a cough or its a symptom
us well get better later
he gon live his whole life waking up every morning to a respirator
so i dont never say what i cant do
if he can be happy with life than nigga i can too
while josé wanna die
aint tell nobody but eyeing his eyes feel i should probably identify
said everyday he lives with pain and wanna end it
somethings wired wrong in your brain you gotta mend it


look the text read at my place you wanna meet
her mouth saying hello her legs were saying peace
her alarm in the morning when she wake up to the d
and now half of the bed wet as she lay naked on the sheets
biting down on the pillows swear she take it like a g
when we finish its to the mission gotta make it through the streets
yeah i be out late tryna get it but you wait up for me
miss dinner cause im eating tell em put a plate up for me
they be coming sideways you gon get that straight up from me
its always get your weight up not your hate up from me
it came to me from finessing baby
by they time it get to you its just a blessing baby
they tried to overlook me underestimate me
shining like a diamond i guess i been under pressure lately
makeup off and she still pretty
im on my way and im still litty
i like her cause she needs no practice
dont wear panties i like easy access
know her role like shes an actress
laid up with your boy gs in the mattress
fouram flexing on them lonely hoes
sipping bobby brown tenderoni flows
my heart belongs to a roni
shes my only lover shes my only love
shes my only lover shes my only love hey


faces be looking familiar sometimes its hard to know
ive been in a whole lot of places ive met a lot of folks
aint had a window to open needed a pot to throw
in my hood the story of mouse is one you gotta know
could ask ma to push the ieight beamer
cant remember where i seen her i think it was la marina
singing all the words to trina
whole demeanor said freak like old pictures of adina
but now all these broads shaped the same and waist trained
im on my third passport i cant remember these niggas
like all the faces is blurred of most these industry niggas
mean game somewhile for an inkling of the fame
and i can spot them from their accents when im thinking of their name
ive seen dames sip pink champagne
and do drugs thatll put charlie sheen to shame
off my penis until i came
the drugs over these years made its way to my mental
pardon if i dont remember when you gave me a demo
or that one night we met up in aces
when it count em an accountant im just better with faces
so its regular joe a regular wherever if ima go
thats since forever ago so its however it could go joey


man yall done gone and did it well come on with it
the fifth got a kick but wont slip i rubber gripped it
wrap you in them sheets on christmas im double gifted
double barrel shotty you double jointed when you flippin
ask about your boy theyll tell you im not the fella
tomato sauce whoever tryna shred up my mozzarella
i guess its in my genes no prints if i got the poke out
man let these niggas reach im iverson with the blow out
sometimes you gotta show out just to show em what joe bout
give em the green light well fuck it where we even goin now
got shooters on the scanner you never know what we spoke bout
picture tony montana with hammers runnin in sos house
ghost town
no matter where they from i disappeared and dump
no choice but to swear they dumb but were not dumb
im on my luke skywalker get your jedi spun
im on my dmc i hear them things rev yall run
guess its begun get the private jet pilot set
alibi in check to the island head make sure its no survivors left
round up all the hostages bum stiggity bum stiggity bum
hey i mean a lot of them shit be soundin like das efx
i pay no mind to the talkin til its a heightened threat
never baby niggas with envy to give me my respect
i eject bullets from rifles wearin a sniper vest
find your body otc youre like a prilosec
yall wont even hear me comin michael myers steps
hear that thing ch ch choppin til no tires left
bulldogs bark fours roars like a lions breath
i love new toys so i invest


let me tell you how i pictured this
a few houses a couple businesses
striving for greatness we would be each others witnesses
and during beef we both would put aside our differences
where i aint flinch a bit making you insignificant
maybe kids and shit perfect arithmetic
meaning we could build our own world and co exist in it
she a synergy sharing energy
let our souls mate in the air if you remember me
now heres what i did with it
went out my way to fuck these stripper chicks
lost good girls making them mistresses
just savages missed marriages
they all was my babies i needed those miscarriages
my worthless self when joe felt hurt
i went out and targeted women who had no self worth
i relate to praying nightly feeling no spell work
when you can do it but a stranger gotta go help first
i called moms on the phone heres what i told her real quick
i said my twentys flew by with no control of the shit
her next sentence swear that ill forever hold with a grip
she said it go by even faster as the older you get
i wanna never dumb down id have to lower my wit
aint gotta post this on the gram for you to know what it is
a partner to trust im thinking even bigger for us
mom shouldve told me this when we had shit to discuss
now neither one of us is how we figured wed be
sometimes the thought of what if still lives here with me
i always pictured wed be

look look
a love thats tideful never prideful
if youre truly better without me how can i spite you
as i yearn for the greatest love i ever had
pardon me kid im still learning how to be a dad
we be in spots you shouldnt be in till you grown
i was absent so long im just not leaving you home
so nah too much to learn too much world out there
let me teach you about these hoes too many girls out there
i respect your moms tutelage
but thats my weird and my brain whats she gon do with this
watch and learn foolish kid
eyes light up with surprise youre just like i am
i think that youre enjoying this ride just like i am
look same pedigree theoretically
cut from a cloth that was gone thats just genetically
one job in life to make you a much better me
greater feeling than i imagine this shit would ever be
you be feeling strong when you diss me in songs
i did the same my whole career would never tell you its wrong
whatever works out whatever the price get that embedded
even if at my expense ill pay it you take the credit
had a power struggle when i thought your mom abused it
my hands were in bondage useless
beyond the excuses calm through it
its crazy our bond music
and we do it beautifully for our beautiful conduit
so right now i stand in a place i never stood before
finally filled the void in my life i wasnt good before
fucking with these hoes that energy i was putting forth
god this is more like the fucking love i was looking for
now its better than we pictured itd be
and the supervised visits well never have to relive it
little nigga well be ha tah


yeah up top whats popping with it
whatever we doing we doing it with a lot of bitches
nigga i mean a whole lot of bitches
outside of my normal some even hotter bitches
yeah shorty say all thats her own body
chances are she already in the phone probably
ass fat enough to buy that bitch her own property
thats my definition of a home body
got a rollie in her wrist and her tone cocky
nonetheless i only check her cause her dome sloppy
gave her all that she could handle though
she put her mouth around the wiz something amber rose
get her naked and she look like amber rose
i was taping the whole thing til the camera froze
to this day her and i remain amicable
she even let me bust first she so mannerable hey

been thinking about you for quite some time
and you aint seen crazy quite like mine
nah ive been occupied sike im lying
you know how the saying go out of sight out of mind
just kidding could tell i like you
she just moved to queens
hella prideful everything i buy two
everything hishers jemele and michael
shouldve been left but im still in here
last place shed expect to see a millionaire go
on and on and on and
please baby no tweets put away your phone and
ride and moaning to five in the morning
had to uber on the way right at you yawning
coma zone joe cologne jo malone
or the creed bottle same color as provolone
if its on don corleone go with the throne
still im the best kept secret though im ultra known
in the focus homes
and that much real estate like the focus homes
when the clothes is gone
how he gon bag that whole approach is wrong
and she aint the type of lady to sit in coach for long
with me as high king she take her liking
to trim and piping when the kitchen viking
quite surprising the pulse of my dreams
if father stretch appears like ultralight beams
surmised by the size of her thighs it might seem
dreamy eyes get wide with the life of my stream hey
getting all up in her guts with it
gotta bust multiple nuts with it
thats how it sound when we together
she my queen with her crown and she down for whatever come on


look the text read at my place you wanna meet
her mouth saying hello her legs were saying peace
her alarm in the morning when she wake up to the d
and now half of the bed wet as she lay naked on the sheets
biting down on the pillows swear she take it like a g
when we finish its to the mission gotta make it through the streets
yeah i be out late tryna get it but you wait up for me
miss dinner cause im eating tell em put a plate up for me
they be coming sideways you gon get that straight up from me

it came to me from finessing baby
by they time it get to you its just a blessing baby
they tried to overlook me underestimate me
shining like a diamond i guess i been under pressure lately
makeup off and she still pretty
im on my way and im still litty
i like her cause she needs no practice
dont wear panties i like easy access
know her role like shes an actress
laid up with your boy gs in the mattress
fouram flexing on them lonely hoes
sipping bobby brown tenderoni flows
my heart belongs to a roni
shes my only lover shes my only love
shes my only lover shes my only love hey


look long live your idols may they never be your rivals
rakim was like jesus chuck d wrote the bible
g rap was god i learned to punch from kane
lived in queens so on farmers we would see todd james
remember the cover of black panther with the fat gold chains
then slick rick had a million of em so i wanted a million of em
yeah back in my first days
when we aint know who was the nicest nigga in threerd base
which emcee was the worst before my emcee search
some niggas thought pete nice me i thought mc serch
this before i ever met em way before hammer dance
this when i was asking carrie anne to make me hammer pants
smooth b was dope greg nice had character
before i ever knew image would even matter bruh
ice cube raised me gotta mention gang starr
me and premier tight right now we in the same squad
always tell me stories on the game and how it changed yall
life dont always come full circle i cant explain god
teacher to student
the overlap and the generational gap im seeing is prudent
so when i speak of pursuing
what we deemed as mere dreams and illusions albeit a nuisance
im brewing from eyes that have seen through it
its no time for even a body to be reclusive
execsll feed you excuses and if its seasoned you chew it
we got old ideologies i think we should renew it
the psychology for some of that reasonings even stupid
for me its deeper than music much deeper than music
they stole our musical freedom up next its freedom of music
as a tenth grade drop out im watching the aftermath
of everything streaming and doing the extremist
this is true shit dont take a genius to see the genius is stewing
aint got the reach to do it so let me reach who can do it
it go

look look
if you live long you see your idols be your rivals
hov was like the goat congratulations on tidal
salute you broke through many barriers for us
when we couldnt move the needle you carried us for us
look forward maybe in thirty years theyll implore us
push to the back of the red ignore us
i think we nearing that border
mr carter who gon fare for the authors
they only there to extort us
who gon be there to record us nigga
even deeper who gon care for our daughters
and our sons just the vultures
we keep handing them the culture
and the hip hop that raised this kid is one that spoke up
im pessimistic i wont even get my hopes up
but if its gon all implode before it blow up
need more than overcharging for what they did to the cold crush
just a psa in lieu of the movement
cant get a quarter back now what about future music
really

so if im gone when tomorrow come
the mission for my only born when tomorrow come
how will we receive songs when tomorrow come
heres my study for understudies to borrow from
new rage  machine nigga we got this
is what you hear when label ideas meet a plot twist
used to be faded from the killer talk
now we suffocating from the pillow talk
they offered me fame as a man i chose dignity uh
guess everything aint for everybody
maybe everybody aint for everything
it aint a thing im looking through my career
im more the long game dude on how i choose to prepare
not the richest just the sickest ask the dudes in your tier
knew if i made it to the top id hate the views from up there
we dont value the same shit i spoke through a despair
stood out before it was cool to be weird
my nigga you just appear
before these niggas hit puberty
i was online talking like its just you and me
the foolery but since we hopping like rabbits
calling everything thats dropping a classic
with all this modern day practice
tactics that should rot in the ashes
some are cut from the same cloth
some have forgotten the fabric listen
raised a nigga that you rather leave at bay
she aint walking in naked she aint fashionably late
have her bring your good shoes
so you can dodge around the rumors
in a suit that light the room up like robert downey jrs
fifth to the court tell i did this before
without a baron ask karen nothing civil in war
its civil war to judging off the shit that i saw
im trying to leave it so our kidsll have more
tomorrow is bigger than all


see im somethin like a phenomenon
go ahead and judge me i aint gotta honor yall
shit i told the judge ill sit never mind the bond
nigga i wont budge in this bitch its like im a don
you cant con a con
left from the long arm of the law
actin right as if my momma involved
my monologue say im back at it
one life so son live it
im committed never did it and wish that i undid it
young kiddies listen the one talkin aint really with it
just forget it would they be talkin if they was really with it
come visit and see that the loudest one aint the one with it
and the one with it is the last one you want with it
been stabbed and jumped slitted
bad then son ascended
and i pum chika chika chika pum pum ch pum chika
never worry or doubt me if you heard about me
awake with nightmares grew with murder around me
im still hitting my shmoney  shmurda and rowdy
ayye calling a bluff
im grown so i never think anythings more than it was like horrible bud
never beefin over these bitches cause its more that i love
i aint warring with cuz over what shes offering but
she got my hammer on rock im like thor in the club
while she semi off the remy bitch got my dick all the way up

look what the lords been agin
straight from the horses jaws of hay
with an enormous rage weighin
unfortunate we dont know the origin but its important is all they sayin
this a formal statement
the airports are delaying got reporters waiting
live from a caucus in a secaucus basement
for rage to leave the cage like a lawless agent
a psycho ward patient thats often pacing
was rage dragging a corpse like a dog with steak umms
for the organizations inauguration
i got shooters on call with the fours just aching
in the four door explorer with the awful gray tints
notes over ya head this a orchestration
how it is when the author give the authorization
imploring you all to ignore the baiting
you gon give ya opinion they gon call it hatin
by law
yeah nigga i know
still gotta ride though i know
look now the side show i dont play it
i might have my nigga tory

i used to drive around the tunnel in the lexus with the snub
same way you know when you up you better know when you slip
studies based of years hanging with the boa constricts
im from an era where we aint deal with all the trolling and shit
when we see you we just go in your shit
its repercussions for actions we demanded more

staring at you new niggas still from an older state

and i dont count her if she aint alter my weekly budget

they say if you aint down to bust then never say its tough
got a black bitch with a body name her nina skill
dont do the back and forth racket but serena will
theres some couple rules imma share with you two
know niggas gon hate you for whatever you do
to let it off you gon need a right hand and the right wrist
and using the beam mean there was a chance that you might miss
a nigga wanna send me a message have it delivered to me
ticket on the coupe sheriff aint even give it to me
they want me killed im ready for it
means ive written my will so im ready for it
but im real so be ready for it
cans and desis for sport
camouflagin the cameras and battery ramming doors
we aint amateurs at all
i flew but sent my mans in the accord
thats a plan moving forward
do i learn to get these hammers on board dawg

tell them bitches they can all come
three aint mind sharing as long as i get them all to cum
one was an alcoholic i swear she was drinking all the rum
two live together uptown but be on fordham some


microphone check its something new yall rage
these views only prelude from the dude on stage
im old school so my mind is in a new york state
still feel like im the best rapper in the new york state
though im a jersey city product we like two doors away
maybe im just the best rapper whipping new york plates
indeed it be the god
if fetty is the face of new jerz then you see how badly we needed i
young doing it my way thats frank sinatra
i might hang with you bloggers but i bang with the mobsters
see me right in hells kitchen having drinks over pasta
need the fake to love the real so let me thank you impostors bicoastal early yall hit the daytons and impalas
started buzzing around the time sporty thievz kept saying nada
emcees aint even bother and i dont know whats truly worse
them wanting my spot or not knowing they gotta move me first

few years weights up still sleep wake up
bitches know the stakes up since i beat my case up
hip hop shit list look at these bastard men dress
im just taking back whats owed and adding interest
maybe just my love died loud lit above high
slugs fly eyes scrubbed dry still a thug cries
all this paraphilia versus my necrophilia
how are they record dealing ya i wasnt ever feeling ya
this feeling equates professional weapon cant seal it bruh
deuce deuce three point zero a chopper beretta millia
hov said thirty is the new twenty me i feel like thirty is the new forty
i bought thirty new fortys
a bitch moving pills get thirtys to move off me
just watch how you moving in jersey its too costly
and memory with candles is where the energy laying you
protect me from my loved ones enemies i can handle
if you talking slaughterhouse please refer to slaughtermouse
think twice before you blink twice you gotta roll with mouth
got you birds popping its korver or kurt warner mouse
and i be dolo nobody gotta come warn the mouse
used to take drives through the tunnel we getting offers now


yo yo please lord somethin gotta give
they say for every negative theres a positive
but i aint positive for every buck deposited
we still in the hood livin like hostages and never mind colleges
school of hard knocks scholarship dealin with politics
i would just sell success in the store if i could bottle it
but i aint a millionaire wont see me in forbes son
life is like a  when you can afford one
ruger loaded just in case the war come
might as well everything is comin to the forefront
need a clear head just to think
and fuck a  nigga im two steps from a drink
the pressure either bust pipes or it make diamonds
no matter how high up the mountain i stay climbin
freedom i keep chancin
so if i fall like beyonce i just get back up and keep dancin


uh let me talk to em real quick la look look
im chasin after pies with bags under my eyes
you lookin at my representative mask its a disguise
and i dont do things like i used to
the past is the past  im presently thinkin about the future
certain niggas bettin i fall
im speed joggin through the quicksand im jugglin three medicine balls
see im comin up used to share a room with two cellmates
now i tower over the devil but this aint hell date
long way to go i see my feet gettin blisters
i dare em talk to me like mike richards
or play don imus and think its cool to disrespect our sisters
i guess we got a while fore they actually get the picture
i think about virginia tech think about katrina
niggas that caught sean bell slippin with the nina
a day before the wedding safety off the weapon
though all these things play in my head i keep steppin


my path for tomorrow is relaxing at full throttle
born to be a leader but a tough act to follow
bet on me at all costs in spite of my cash
so if i cant afford the waldorf i can afford to fall off
stories over greatness no stopping my zone
im bumping romans revenge but im plotting my own
like a prophecy in case niggas havent learned not to bother me
fore you send your shots just check my return policy
could do without the leeches shoes without the creases
miami heat hater but i do the south beaches
for any drama i be calling up monsters
i aint gilbert i never met a wall i cant conquer
ruger aimed if im who you try and belittle
i learned its hard to get justice when you try and be civil
whatever the future holds i can live with the day
some niggas will sell their soul but some will give it away
and thats the devil in disguise they window of opportunity is minimized
simplified check what i exemplify
bitch nigga heres something for you to generalize
estate out by tenafly pool houses winterized
play in that water you bound to get your feet wet
only rapper with nuttin to hide me and g dep
my shorty might disagree with that sentiment
if i keep something from you i promise its all innocent
bitches gon get you with that fake out beat
i wont let them media takeout me a made nigga
gotta know when dealing with me you gon put up with a lot of hate
before you say you love me how much of it can you tolerate
you cant talk about marriage and giving birth
if you hit the dirt anytime you think i lift a skirt
it grows tiresome every time you get berserk
plus if you abandon home over what was just a flirt
without a care i just chuck deuces
my skinll turn numb and youll be stuck with what your truth is
then youll feel a way thinking i should have resisted
then youll start to see a side of me you never knew existed
cause you never seen me act like a jerk
i know women will provoke you and get mad when it works
rather reserved and that always makes matters the worst
cause i go on about my business and not act like it hurts
but wait its to the point i gotta ask myself
why the fuck is it so easy to detach myself
maybe it aint you just something i lack myself
but if these wounds are self inflicted i can patch myself
now listen i could give a fuck bout how them other niggas treated you
if your ass was that perfect they would be with you
i dont care if you dimed out
youll say youre the best ill ever have and ill say im willing to find out
wait im thinking bout our bond and what happened to it
if you aint lifting the burden you probably adding to it
she say my logics wild and its sick to her
she say im all for self and dont consider her
she feel like she dont have a voice in this relationship
im thinking boo you got a choice so why you taking it
certain shit i wouldnt stand for
im giving her my all but she demands more
i wish she would understand more
certain shit you couldnt plan for
im guessing if i love you and youre worth it
i should take some time out and figure if you deserve this
but you just think that im full of it
we both come from backgrounds of bullshit
im fortunate that aint what you see in me
ill stop lying to you once you start believing me

but im always who you wanna bring the questions to
its less about me hiding shit and more about protecting you
its totally different the way our minds are made up


they say the worlds coming to an end homie i dont care
bullet proof in my closet that i dont wear
niggas talk behind my back as if i wont hear
back against the ropes like i wont dare
bitch i dont tear
i know too many niggas facing twentyfive to life
i know too many aint make to twentyfive in life
too many look up to me im who they idolize
no soap opera i aint your guiding light
worry bout my car and the kit what up michael knight
i bared my all you would think im bout to die tonight
im trying not to get stuck lifestyle of a trojan
it mean im tryna not to get fucked what up

they say the worlds coming to an end i find it funny
cause mine is just beginning
mine is full of women
mines like a roller coaster
but i slow up the ride
then they get sick to they stomach
but all they could throw up is pride
you talking bout a recession that i cordially ignore
fuck a dollar if you morally poor
r r r all yall adore and see is royalty
nevermind income spoil me with loyalty
its too many fake niggas not enough real
theres too many emcees not enough deals
too many broke when theres too many bills
too many ways to attain wealth
fuck a poor economy blame yourself
guess we cant all leave the hood just rapping
they say society is twisted like it just happened
nigga i call bogusness
so if you fucked up probably cause you just noticed it

they say the worlds coming to an end
now everybody got a complaint
everybody trying live like they some kind type of saint
only nigga not trying to be something i aint
that aint the picture i paint
and if i did itd be stained
lifes a bitch im fully ready to meet her
ill be in my best fit ima have the fresh caesar
since im eager be in the room dusting off the heater
have a fully loaded forty pointed at her when i meet her
take her to the hood gunpoint bitch dont tempt me
force her eyes open look at lives vacant empty
no wonder that they shower me with hatred and envy
ive picked the wrong nigga couldnt make it against me
fuck your healthcare health scare
even though im well aware
counting down till i pull the trigger like hell yeah
i be the last time you impose
legs crossed with my cig lit
now watch it all implode


my path for tomorrow is relaxing at full throttle
born to be a leader but a tough act to follow
bet on me at all costs in spite of my cash
so if i cant afford the waldorf i can afford to fall off
stories over greatness no stopping my zone
im bumping romans revenge but im plotting my own

its less about me hiding shit and more about protecting you
its totally different the way our minds are made up


last thing im tryna be is the good guy now
i aint never gave a fuck why should i now
this shit im talking bout right here
let me tell you niggas something
you can be anything in this world that you want
except for my downfall

im a victim of society circumstance or just feelings
was a nigga victimized or just willing
no blinds no bags just dealing
no foundation or floor plan just building
check it nights bright but the days dark
covered in tattoos but hate art
these eggshells i walk on are razor sharp
staring at the finish line looking for a way to start
ive been called everything an extremist
is that a bad thing or what they really mean is
anything a nigga do a nigga mean it
and i wont let a person place or thing come between it
an opportunist is how they paint me
but if the nigga only knocks once can you blame me
still i feel like my problems are great
shit if i dont never solve em im straight
on the bright side god choose me to put a lot on my plate
so he had to figure i wouldnt be bothered by the weight
im trying to change the pattern but its on loop
even an outcast in my own group
whats it mean when eybody standing next to you expects of you
everything that comes wit a spectacle
if everywhere i go i just leave behind residue
tell me trust me i wont think nothing less of you

no moment of clarity
the next fight showing is a rarity
severity in me against my growin popularity
rappers wont rap im forced to believe they scared of me
but can no longer use the scape goat they not aware of me
so yall can go and throw your little pot shots
some dudes dissed me and temporarily got hot
im getting my head right recollecting
yall looking for some website resurrection
being that i got too much to lose
or maybe a slight chance that a nigga guilty of all that im accused
no longer amused affected my loved ones
now they startin to bruise
and i dont want no parts of that abuse
wouldnt wish upon my worst foe a day in my shoes
thatll just eliminate any excuse
and why entertain em
old me woulda lost my senses yall just helping the new me regain em
been punched in the face
it was either feed my family or hunt wit the thirtyeight
i aint want brunch to wait
ive out grown hip hop it turned into a day care
so next time some shit is on my mind itll stay there
im staring at the man in the mirror
but it aint helping see the man any clearer
so i get mia from around yall
till god stops answering these prayers for my downfall

tell me what am i to do
if i aint have a soul a nigga always had you pardon due
but i gotta speak candidly
how the fuck could you abandon me
wit five years of blood sweat and tears
but it was obviously a disconnect
we turned that into a disrespect
said she been holding it inside for years shes unhappy
so the girl i wan marry was afraid to come and tap me
so i went away on tour and you went on one of your own
but while you was on the horn all day wit ol boy
did you ever think about what it would do to your home
whats his name wheres he live
what is it he offers whats he got to give
and i love you so much that when i caught on to your fibs
i hit you like a man you wore it in your ribs
i was heated
but had to be strong enough to remove the infidelity and see whats underneath it
come to find out you felt lied to and cheated
mistreated and kept it a big secret
or are you just loose
and im so naive im tryna give you an excuse
now that i refuse to believe we life partners
holy water on whatever devil come and try to part us
cant use anything i ever gave you to bury me
you supposed to be the one to bury me
you wan leave then goodbye
think the grass look greener on the other side but its dye


look we gon need more than a block we monopolizing
nah im not rapping im prophesying
quite simply seat back diamond white bentley
approach it i might empty since i never gave a fluck
aint nothing you can say that might offend me
not when only reason shortys in the ride is to karrine me
when you do a little better they begin to hate ya
so i keep animals with me its just in my nature
if you dont wanna hear the real then i aint finna make ya
you just keep hearing whats coming from them incinerators
but when they show the hatred is when you know you made it
me i been to hell and back the shit is over rated
but every day could be your last so if trouble met me
hell be with a few of viagras and a couple beckys
you want a crash course know the damages
i promise yall that if i got high id smoke canibus
from best to worst from legend to barely here
since they repod your prime this shit aint really fair
losing his mind somebody better set him straight
lost buckingham palace now its section eight
in zero point two why rep that hard
and who the fluck dug him up from wyclefs backyard
but off him not a part of you is trife
and you cant afford the drama when your arsonals a knife
no heart in you to survive nigga living like an orphan
beefing bout new jersey but you living in new orleans
i aint even got to stab you far from a threat
i dont get why a hitman felt he needed to holla at you
come to rapper shit you real bad at matching wits
im better with a badder bitch how im not the catalyst
when the shots finish flying i bury the biscuit
i fall off the same day tyler perryll miss it
but what stifles me is how you sit back and idly
call this a rivalry when your idols me
how you throw a shot at everything you try to be
sad part is nothing in your life coincides with me
now tell me thats your strategy son
the clips extended they looking like natalie nunn
sayin we can blow the shotties how is he supposed to stop me
as a hobby i get high inhaling decomposing bodies
and if you decide to cross joe ill be waiting with a crossbow
and feed his torso to my baby cane corso
shit has gone far enough its time to finish this
should stop starting chess matches gainst the limitless
friends with my foes so my peers are annoyed
everyday they just watch me cry tears of joy
i dont care for the ploy came up from being hella broke
you think the fans are buying music im selling hope
heres some insight homie fuck making a friend
my funeral gon be by invite only
by chance im going to hell maybe for selling dope
i want my own table sectioned off with a velvet rope
might want to see heaven might need a telescope
a girl to restock anytime the wine cellars low
bottle service maybe a couple whores
high ceilings flat screens and double doors
im not a cult member im not a worshipper
just a jers nigga trying to have a couple words with her
strollin through the hood til she seem outta place
used to niggas blowing her up thatll cling to her waist
me ive never been a nigga that a fiend had to chase
ask for gucci all you gon get is cream to the face
so i put my g stacks up against your little weed stash
a one time only event wont get a recap
aim it at his knee caps have niggas in your crib
when you get home your lil girl in the back they think its tcap
so yall can put all the blaming on me
but keep in mind this is training for me tah


closer than close well
closer than most
i just see so much in you
and i want a better view
i want to look deeper into you yeah

see god built everybody differently ya mean
ready for the hard part
everybody aint got the same makeup
we aint all built alike
only thing is when you put in that spot
you can ask yourself what are you built for

uh im getting ready for the hard part
this the first time me and you have been this far apart
uh not the first time that you packed
but the first time that you left first time that i just stood and watched
more like stood there shocked look at what ive done
the first time that i conceded and pride won
that was our first time in court together but not really
cuz i wasnt allowed to even look your way
thats that paper work you filed right
cant communicate with the woman bearing my child right
we both lost it shit was a wild night
unfortunately we didnt go down without a fight
always said that i wouldnt know what to do without you
loved what i knew about you not what was new about you
you step back and notice shit got realer
cuz yall are closer than most but still aint looking familiar

well fuck it this what we all wanted
so i figured fuck it i can use another crack at
so what i ran from for eight years im right back at
fucking with a major now i got my group with me
good cuz the scrutiny usually has me acting stupidly
and even though they all think that im a weirdo
when i look to my left and my right they right there though
they was naive when they said that we was all through
all walk a same path feel like we the lords group
the industry dont know the type of damage we gon cause you
same one yall called flukes is looking like war troops
at the point where even legends give respect
went from outside of the game to getting lead in by the best
cause yeah wont stop till our title they cant argue
though we closer than most still i gotta thank marshall

closer to family closer to my regime
closer to goapele i mean closer to my dreams
i was closer to the block was closer to them fiends
so nah i aint from the streets but we closer than we seem
check it closer to comfort closer to wealth
but not closer than you can afford you gotta know yourself
closer to a lead so its murder in the booth
say they closer to the real but thats further from the truth
and im closer than the people thats wishing for my demise
fuck me worry bout that sickness you got inside
figure im just a reflection of your miserable life
since you less fortunate you wanna picture him deprived
why i stay to myself and get closer to rap
cuz getting closer to you will be getting closer to that
and since thats a little ways im kinda closer to fruition
i just kick my feet back and got a chauffeur for the distance

ha joey ya mean yall throw that shit my way
right field center field left field
im a golden glove winner try it
yall throw that shit my way im totally built for this
are you though


yea
its that on top muzik
yea wait a minute

yo i left the jumpsuit on a park bench
slept there smellin like the park stench
freezin covered with a dark trench
that room more like the kryptonite to my clark kent
tired of all the iq tests and all the arguments
nurses light the candles with the calm scents
i aint been calm since they actin like i aint got any common sense
too much time spent for a godsend
so i left on my own recognizance handful of klonopins
lookin for a car jack vict preferably dark tints
seems you got to eat to get even and my odds slim
they say im a animal cannibal hannibal
lookin at my past i see how thats understandable
so you god damn right im unmanageable
everything im lookin at is a fuckin intangible
my reality is reality
they reality is all perception
in my reality thats an infection
my reality dont want no part of that detection
so i pick it up and move it to another section
they reality you would think is full of perfection
correction they reality is all deception
in reality only few will make that connection
but if you like me you know not to take that direction
if reality is dead im the resurrection
nominate myself so lets skip over the election
theyll say im the wrong selection
dont meet they expectance
but i aint lookin for motherfuckin acceptance
fuck yall expect shit the mud on ya white glove
reality is full of rules im full of objections
they reality is a big misconception
so i left just to lose my recollection but still
realestate

yo they say money makes the world go round
but it really doesnt
did i think i was in a room when i really wasnt
i thought i was on the move wasnt really budging
but you aint never wore my shoes who you really judging
some people are so judgmental ill allow that
you can judge anything but my mental
he dont know what i been through
from results of the pencil
cuts from being resentful
dont cover much of the stencil
when i couldnt walk they aint have a crutch to lend dude
so i say what i feel fuck if i offend you
some fail maybe some of succeeded
some need to be wanted some wanna be needed
i scream and yell they dont hear my call
and it seems much as i fell dont know where i fall
not at all im just actin out fate
but aint much change since i escaped all i know is


check out your man who came up around the dope boys and backstabbers
a dropout whom some referred to as a backpacker
dude they used to laugh at member him
bad rapper exactly why being on the cover of that mag matters
i chop it up with some artists i used to beef with
glad we all grew to see how played out beef is
besides that aint something were all willing to afford
when your talented you try to get a million out of more
made a killing on tour so while im wheelin that azure
im wishing all my black youths could know the feeling i endure
for some folks my ceiling is their floor
wondering where id be if i aint feel like persevering anymore
look what time does need a reality check
itll remind us you cant run from it itll always find us
and thats the game i respect it
rockin a different watch but it gives the same message

look i used to see her on the tv
now she textin how she miss me and she need me
its funny i remember when she couldnt take it
now when she get naked
look at ya man washed up
lookin like he needs to wash up
fell off now he just watch us
was playin ball something happened to the weight
tried the dope boy shit but i guess the same applied
had a short fall from grace how the fucks you a critic
damn near thirtyfive how the fucks you in a civic
rimmed up tryna stunt lookin ridiculous
and he be dead sober with them drunk lookin bitches
frail ass nigga life movin slow snail ass nigga
in the club before twelve ass nigga
and the nigga used to knock me now his shit is just sloppy
catch him in some jeans shorts issey miyake
smoked out son you aint get the memo
still believing your own hype still making demos
no grind which lead to a short prime
but homie aint got a watch how he gon know the time


i finally found a passion i lacked before
cant believe i didnt catch ya under the act before
i mean i voiced my complaints that went ignored
a few things you felt that you was too attractive for
cause eerything out your mouth said that you aint wanna hurt
love the lifestyle we lived but you aint wanna work
so id sit you down and say its getting outta hand
while you shoot down eery idea busy worried about a brand
when ya baby dad said all that shit that was trife
how you was married requesting dick pics from lyfe
though it all seemed shady maybe i was crazy
i ignored my gut feelin nah not my baby
accusing me but pretending yourself
i couldnt catch it too busy defending myself
or was i wrong not seeing a life without you
or taking eerything that you said at face value
you packed up and left dude i was so glad
shouldve questioned how you easily became a nomad
if i could do it all again it wouldntve happened so fast
and it burns with every line jotted in this notepad
cause at first you resembled my twin
fast forward you gave me identical twins
but then you lost it honestly that murked my soul
cause though we wadnt tryna have one we got off the birth control
and we was right back at it fucking like addicts
while you was disrupting what was seeming like a marriage
you never got embarrassed interrogating me but that was just yaris
yeah we beef and i dragged you off the bed
i swear to this day i re enact it in my head
so i hemmed you up wasnt what i aimed to do
i aint attack you bitch i was restraining you
but you was wifey though i understand that its not a game
can you imagine my surprise when the cops came
handcuffed me you pressed charges
but i made bail its just heartless
you cant smash my laptop on the wall
and then think i wasnt gonna react scratch that
i mean you cant call my mom like can i crash at your spot whattup
when im her son and you just locked me up
but wait this is when it really gets deep
judge says she get control of the house for a week
filed a restraining order so she couldnt come near me
the fuck else i do but go right back to tahiry
im sleeping on her couch not discussing shit
staring at the fattest ass not fuckin it
i guess despite everything that she showed me
it felt good to be around a broad that really knows me
i missed all our arguin and yappin
percocets and muscle relaxers in a napkin
cant believe that it happened
i lost my unborn daughter when we fought
im thinking i killed aspen
and thats when i thought that wed be dead awhile
but we decided to reconcile
so hungover from love and what not
how could you not expect us to take another shot
but during all this time we dont live together
stupid me thought youd go get your shit together
you know get a job or if actings your career
seems youve pursued the shit for a year from right here
and it appears along with all the yelling and the screaming
we both at the table but my side is leaning
but rather than end it we tried to mend it
fuck bein a couple lets work on a friendship
but then it got weird i was stunned from that
you took it to a place where there was no coming back


check it
more questions more answers
more ci smoke and more cancer
more arguing more resistance
its seems like the closer we get its more distance
more angles a million different looks
was on the same page just in different books
theres so much i want to say but i got no ground
how we go from thoughts of marriage
thoughts of me copping karats
talks of what wed name her while shopping for a carriage
but when the dream stopped who knew youd see me like a savage
that you dreamt of vacations but only woke up with baggage
all you ever did was love me and look at where it got you
and when you wanted more all i did was say im not you
im selfish not selfless and i say that with love
so in essence youre asking for what im incapable of
so now i find im going over choices i aint even made yet
were we clouded by good times or great sex
running fast towards an unknown fate
you cant see how you ever began to like a liar
you lost track of all the little things that i admired
but when the peace left i knew we might retire
thinking man i live upstairs im something like somaya
got memories but at what point are they lost
you say we could work through it at what point is it forced
we shoulda never rushed
cause its like now we at a point where you wont never trust
and for me i cant believe thats all we ever was
the highs gone need a better buzz
cause we sleep in the same bed but we never touch
my solution to every beef is to revisit
though well have the same emotions we wont be so livid
wont be so vivid
i think your girl secretly applauded our drama
we dont need those critics
we owe it to go over our foundation with a keen eye
sad part to say you never have the same dream twice


look standing in the cypher rocking
to driving some of the hottest cars new jerseys ever seen
to dropping some of the dopest mixtapes that you ever heard
and its all courtesy of weed a couple of percs and lean baby
i wish you niggas that would owe me
some breadll come and drop it off
i wish she start tongueing a girl but she wont pop it off
wish i knew you wasnt with the shit so what you hopping for
when pussys thrown your way every nanosecond its not an option yall
normally a sponge but this some shit i just cannot absorb
why yall are dressed like metro boomin i wish you would knock it off
wish the best mc didnt mean who is more popular
but i just booked my next nine months ready to lock in more

i hear they thinkin bout speakin my name
bet if they could im takin bets
money on my hood money on me im good
money on the wood money on wishin that money would
thats him against the wild life
and i got money on the woods baby
two bitches threes company how i half with her
this hennessy dont do the trick then watch the jack trip her
im tryna buy a compound i need the pad bigger
thats seven bed rooms eight and half baths i figure
bad strippers and fraudulent hourglass figures
got every bartender thinkin shell get a glass slipper
you see a line of bottles comin guess who orderin em
im pointin at one they all coming in
every rapper in the world my crew is slaughtering them
put vegetables in your house nobody walking again
what time you get off im showing up there
nine in one hand fortyfive in the other round quarter to ten

how many mcs must get dissed
in the great words of buckshot my answers why the fuck not
come to bars im the same nigga that love to club hop
dont be the guy to  get your entire team in a rough spot
we the og thorough niggas huggin the block
way down to the crooked businessman thats fudgin them docs
the early teams in the hoods out there fuckin with cops
know they fuck with us back now especially if you black now
its joe


i broke down a while ago finally picking up the pieces
memoirs on how the undefeated can feel depleted
i dont talk to god as a matter of fact i plead with
at times i hate my reflection and others im conceited
half the time im arrogant other times im vengeful
at times its to convince me at times its to convince you
done a lot of wrong but i aint never felt resentful
its been so many times i lost track of who to repent to
half the time im in the cut dont want you to notice me
grow with me and youll see that im only awkward socially
half the time im spiteful double barrel rifle
i owe so many payback i feel like i got a right to
so if you need a case in point you can refer to budden
and itll prove the painkillers never murdered nothin
all it did was make me succumb put ice in me make me numb
when i revisit the places it takes me from im sprung

listen up as a sinner reports my inner thoughts like an inner war
headaches act as a tremblin force on my mental ward
mentals distraught every word from this sinister boss
is brought to you by the people like your ministers porsche
tight ropin on dental floss before the haters begin to get lost
coke and weed got my temperament off
but why would my temper get lost when as soon as the temperature frost
im probably havin intercourse in a resort
criminal report pricey condos at a minimal cost
my train of thought aint as simple as yours
so if our paths happen to incidentally cross
i pray that you can overlook all my miniature flaws
until then lets let the bass kick
take a shot straight i dont see a need to chase it
tryin to fight the urge til theres somethin to replace it
i welcome yall to be my co pilots on this spaceship

yo me and the gang would get so blunted
wed order take out from the chinese stores
say make sure you bring change for a hundred rob him safety on the metals off
figured if we beat the brakes off him
then how the fuck was he gonna pedal off
some live and die by the high i was born by it
since pop gave my mom the needle like go on try it
got me feeling like aint a nigga could harm me
so i go and scoop a mami that wanna come join the army
she was so militant disciplined diligent
so i whispered to her bet you wouldnt mind chillin and
i got to know her on my sofa
i gave her my honorable discharge and she took it like a soldier
see she the type you gotta watch when she come around
really she only get high so she can come down
lost her when i said she aint gotta settle
once you start ahead in life youll be on the same level i bet you

when i was five this what my father said
i should have pulled you out and left you on your mamas water bed
you ask me my papas dead
alcoholic genes from him since a toddler bottle fed
put me in your stainless im brainless im a hollow head
 surprised im even walkin
can you blame me if im  but i aint stephen hawkins
i know god is in my  i can see him often
in the face of an innocent baby but not when preachers talkin


yo i seen shorty on the staircase in front of an empty beer case
weird face almost like he was scared straight
like he aint have a care in life  wipin tears from his eyes
that already appeared to have been dried
we chopped it said he was adopted
and theres a lot of shit he just tucks in his closet
real calm said hed always feel harm
and all he want to do is meet his real dad and real mom
all the nice home and clothes do is remind me
in all these years they aint even tried to find me
never mind love i feel like they never liked me
if i thought there was a god i would ask the nigga why me
but some things you better off havin never knew
maybe they wanted better for you than they could ever do
you got a family i see that you dont care for them
but love gon always be love no matter where its from
what if i said your moms couldnt give birth
contemplated leavin earth til you brought her life worth
whatever you goin through could always be much worse
dont make a mistake mistakin your blessings for a curse
so told dude you in the right place right here
cant run to your corner when life dont wanna fight fair
thingsll become quite clear
when you decide to wake up and stop havin fantasies about a nightmare  yeah

yeah you damn right she on her high horse
she say dont worry bout hers nigga ride yours
before you talk clean your own backyard
souped up and sought after by the athletes and rap stars
developin a name creepin to fame
she quick to trade her vagina for a seat at the game
and its so foul she dont see the shame
in the act or the fact that she view it as an equal exchange
but she stay with the newest on louboutins
buyin groceries with coupons sleepin on a futon
no self esteem to cover her lack of confidence
she get on twitter retweetin all the compliments
pretty face nice strut with a nice butt
disguise of a slut only tryin to get wifed up
but when its party time she wont be a second late
once she leaves vip its back home to section eight
what confused me
is niggas tried to kick it but she come across bougie in her best friends jewelry
part time mother  but somethin real shady when her
two year old daughter much closer to the babysitter
cry when she alone product of a broke down home
wont change cause she already grown
already set in her ways no need in tryin to help
so shed rather find wealth before she can find herself  yeah


now if it goes to the wire
i will never fall i got the soul of a fighter
walk barefoot over the coal through the fire
i thought the toll would be lighter but make sure that blunts rolled a little tighter
i tell em im just lookin for some peace of mind
but they say im only working with a piece of mine
if ima do itll be of my own accord no crush
swear to god i never called upon the lord so much
play the corner of the club laughin at the wannabes
its ironic cause they erything i wanna be
would light a ton of reef
but thats gon unleash everything im tryna hide underneath
uh then id lose all ive earned
uh and if theres two things that ive learned
is im the only thing at stake
and when you the only thing real really you the only thing fake
uh must be time to escape from that
and fuck rhymes might be time to escape from rap
why should i be the only nigga to escape from the act
so i lie since everybody just escape from fact
yo that sucker shit niggas be on i cant dig it
joe wont lose even if you plan to rig it
yeah nuttin to prove with no fear of how im depicted
im here wont move i dont care to be evicted
you dont like how i move
well i aint gon keep still any nigga want me killed
wanna leave me in the streets peeled
well if it happens it happens i believe in free will
just know that aint how we built
ill call niggas that will dead you for a cheap thrill
when the clips empty they gon try and refill
and ima be the dude to try stop em like please chill
yall know what im about
they keep puttin up roadblocks i keep findin alternate routes
now success seems likely everybody wanna try me
im all for it cant trip me up wont fall for it
im just a man without a care
neighbor to heartache roommate with despair
reminded my past is darker
cause when am died  i was starin at travis barker
wishin there was something i could say to make him cheer up
and so i prayed and he teared up
i aint wanna see him go through that
the same shit that i feel i just never show you that
guess its none of nobody business
and it just makes you look weaker every joke is just smoke
gotta look deeper never mind dont bother
cause some of yall are smart enough and got sense
that if you try harder youll get a glimpse of everything
that i harbor we all aint got the strength to be a martyr
so to anyone who ever loved me
i apologize and im sorry
whole heartedly cant change
its just part of me its not music shits art to me
too fucked up to drive heres the car key
i dont care where we go just get it far from me
choices i dont wanna make but i know i have to
worlds goin faster since my ride or die chose the latter
lookin for a rush out of habit
proof theres a such thing as too much for a addict
aint the nigga im belittled as riddled ass
nigga come from middle class when you speak to me show a little class
dropped out of school cause a nigga couldnt sit through class
learnt to fall asleep through the sound of a pistols blast
i come from where dad taught mom to get high
but she strong so we still got by
when i picked up the drug why the fuck was they surprised
if it wasnt for your genes i wouldnt lust the supply
i come from a whole hood tellin me that im next
handin me a mag mustve noticed i was complex
they say that you a wild individual
you just not gettin my style you too typical
erybody got a word for me
shit yall deem important aint pertinent to me nigga
put your opinion with a feather and balance that
grab medicine when the success and the talent match


look look look shout to all my fans glad i can inspire yall
got a couple haters still tryin to acquire more
youre prayin to a higher power hopin i should fall
but even my writers block ends in a firewall
everybody acts reckless judgin by they past efforts
if they ran shit why it wont show up on they track records
how could the critics ever hear me and say im a suffer
how when they play with words and i make em play with each other
choppers over the booth ready for prime time
become one with his thoughts intertwine with his mind
go toe to toe blow for blow or do it rhyme for rhyme
be competitive coke heads and go line for line
honestly that crap of yours you should raffle off
with me they gettin genius bars without the apple store
under the microscope i rebut the scrutiny
if im to be compared its only to who i used to be
take a closer look at rappers and you might discover
these faggots talking boxing avoid the mike buffers
now you the type to cuff her me i get tired of her
see you the type get hyped to hug her but wont try to fuck her
them pencil thin bitches me that aint the style he dates
mine sit on the bed and leave an imprint of a smiley face
check it check check it let me change pace
the alternate routes a long one but youll ultimately end up in the same place
so i tell aspiring artists think beyond greater
i know some niggas with platinum plaques and bronze paper
but better livin should be earned never fed or givin
so i traded my recognition instead for a vision
they always told me that id end up dead or in prison
who ever thought that same dude gettin head while he whippin
that the chicks would hang up on give em the dial tone
now buyin wild homes straight cash without loans
i always managed to do better when theres doubt shown
ill teach you how to turn them diamonds into milestones
class is in session and look whos come to tutor
they passin the fake off as real like brian pumpers jeweler
where im from niggas with fear gettin slumped by shooters
but my equal to dumpin rugers is done by computers
give em substance but they treat every word like its a hollow
my niggas off parole im tryin to give em somethin pure to follow
cause he aint have a pot to piss in just a urine bottle
i come from where so many people were raised with neglect
cops tryin to meet they quota thirsty to make an arrest
all my wrongdoings did was put my faith to a test
which made me much stronger guess my mistakes were correct

ta ha
ta ha 


they say the worlds coming to an end homie i dont care
bullet proof in my closet that i dont wear
niggas talk behind my back as if i wont hear
back against the ropes like i wont dare
bitch i dont tear
i know too many niggas facing twentyfive to life
i know too many aint make to twentyfive in life
too many look up to me im who they idolize
no soap opera i aint your guiding light
worry bout my car and the kit what up michael knight
i bared my all you would think im bout to die tonight
im trying not to get stuck lifestyle of a trojan
it mean im tryna not to get fucked what up

they say the worlds coming to an end i find it funny
cause mine is just beginning
mine is full of women
mines like a roller coaster
but i slow up the ride
then they get sick to they stomach
but all they could throw up is pride
you talking bout a recession that i cordially ignore
fuck a dollar if you morally poor
r r r all yall adore and see is royalty
nevermind income spoil me with loyalty
its too many fake niggas not enough real
theres too many emcees not enough deals
too many broke when theres too many bills
too many ways to attain wealth
fuck a poor economy blame yourself
guess we cant all leave the hood just rapping
they say society is twisted like it just happened
nigga i call bogusness
so if you fucked up probably cause you just noticed it

they say the worlds coming to an end
now everybody got a complaint
everybody trying live like they some kind type of saint
only nigga not trying to be something i aint
that aint the picture i paint
and if i did itd be stained
lifes a bitch im fully ready to meet her
ill be in my best fit ima have the fresh caesar
since im eager be in the room dusting off the heater
have a fully loaded forty pointed at her when i meet her
take her to the hood gunpoint bitch dont tempt me
force her eyes open look at lives vacant empty
no wonder that they shower me with hatred and envy
ive picked the wrong nigga couldnt make it against me
fuck your healthcare health scare
even though im well aware
counting down till i pull the trigger like hell yeah
i be the last time you impose
legs crossed with my cig lit
now watch it all implode


something mustve changed me niggas might defame me
but things that used to taint me no longer seem to restrain me
strangely im no longer sad mad or angry
shame ably it pains me feeling like it just aint me
mainly what do i tell all the people that thank me
namely those who ordain me aside from can you blame me
motivation the game was supplying me its no longer providing me
jason williams something killed whatever was driving me
worrying less about the past more about the now
less about what im going through more about the how
its for certain spent thirty years being fit for hurdling
now im a different person with nothin to overcome and i miss the burden
for certain got six figures in my sock drawer
and honestly this year i expect to make a lot more
its hard to live without a budget when life is corrupted
in a house thats so peaceful that im trying to disrupt it
scream fuck it not because i have to but because i love it
which makes me as fake as the puppets that i speak of disgusted
without a paddle up shits creek
dig deep and see it aint life its just me
so be warned as im putting on like im reformed
only so yall can accept it as being my norm
maybe i quit working on me maybe i given up
maybe i been lying to myself maybe i give a fuck

i say it loud hoping someone can hear me clearly
trying to make my girl get it she dont know that its very scary
but shes a nympho she can be barely near me
she still want the god in her think she mary mary
the prettiest bitches just want to service me
while niggas prettiest bitches wouldnt get a word from me
some of you havent heard from me some of you wouldnt mind murking me
find that news funny likes its straight from ron burgundy
these niggas aint never seen dough
they can dream though i bump into em in between shows
people say im emo what that really mean though
is though the song cant breathe i actually make it seem so
i lost loved ones because they couldnt deal with me
cherish whoever still with me though the merits been killed in me
normally its just me and my lonely mind
everyone storm is different so this forecast is only mine
fans recognize my misery uplifted me
shifted me to my epitome guess the curse is a gift to me
maybe its serendipity maybe its weighing on me physically
maybe i should man up and tell god not to solicit me
been medicated meditated sedated hated
character assassinated all theses years i masqueraded
hard headed if it was on my mind i had to say it
tongue on the devils pitchfork to see how disaster tasted
rap is fabricated rappers are so exaggerated
wouldnt be scared of the truth if they werent castrated
grab a mag spray it surrounded by people that shoot it before me
thatll unconditionally love my beautiful ugly
now lemme speak to who i cater to
would you love me the same if all my weeks were not favorable
promised to maintain being unique but relate able
all while suffering from a disease that can do away with you


now we were once two niggas of the same kind
went to holla at a hoochie with the same line
sorta honestly ill never guessed you were a hoarder
and all that would manifest cause of what we both thought of her
so im like how could you get mad of what she thought of me
i found out seasons dont only change quarterly
cause you got bitter it was real fickle
with me saying girls are a dime a dozen to a nigga with a nickel
i guess nobody told him that gossip and slander is not the answer
wish ida known that she woulda flipped out of propaganda
ice in my veins some people are less skilled
and he brought me up on charges when his ego got killed
when my friends in doubt they learned a valuable lesson bout
in thirty years i aint reckon how to reconcile
what hurts more the act of getting cut off
or realizing that your two cents wasnt worth more

nothing could help somebody switch up more then thirst can
i seen the ill effect that fame can have first hand
am i to blame for the person that you became
were youre already on that path its so hard for me to explain
look some indicate that im watching who i never met
i see some things happening now that you would never let
if you were in your right mind
were you showing me the right person at the right time
or were you trying to make it easy
did it really please you to please me
did that make you change everything about you to appease me
my prides in shambles wondering why and when did you decide to gamble
or are you competing with mya campbell
when did that become suitable
how could you make something so ugly out of what was once beautiful
next time beautys headed towards me i plan to dodge
until i see its not just being used as a camouflage

only reason i continue to antagonize
just my way of bringing truth into a pack of lies
reveals peoples true colors removes a bad disguise
even though its something i predicted i just act surprised
that way the armor never chinks on me
drunk mouth sober tongue homie drinks on me
that way im protected yall got no choice but to respect it
seen too many come and go to be affected
and how is it not expected
im hip to what its bound to be
and them relationships combined aint weigh a pound to me
and so the bullshit make sure its tasteful when its done
you can keep your one point zero faces but try being faithful to one


come along c come come along
but i dont trust niggas so make sure you come alone
i hand picked you you think sensibly
they friends with you dont need em to be friends with me
come along im a take you to some spots that you might like
but bring shades you gonna need em for the bright lights
grab a drink invite dykes that like vics
we always end up fightin cause thats my vice
and youll see how it feels when you sittin on the throne
when you so much better but they act like it aint known
so if somebody else is on it its a temporarily loan
hard to compete when there aint no competition
if everybodys the best why i feel like comp is missin
forced to find inspiration when i never had to
so i go against myself its a better battle
now come along c come come along
turned up the volume on her favorite song
we got so much in common
except when it comes to rhymin
she feel like lyrics are so intrusive
but i feel about her the way she feels about music
shes cute
she dont like the words she just like the beat and im thinkin me too

check it come along c come come along
and watch these niggas thats doin it all wrong
throwback swag nigga still doin rims
still doin throwbacks you still doin timbs
lookin for a way to save you aint earnin no cake
moved back in with moms she wont turn you away
then you all on the blogs showin off a cl
when its followed by the k gotta know its a mistake
benefit of the doubt homie if that aint your daughters car
i suggest you stop rappin about a audemars
cause in return im a just call a fraud
every time i hear a bar about the baller you are
now listen come along c come come along
she gonna probably drop her drawers if she step into my home
she gonna probably be on cock
its big enough to get lost in without jack or john locke
on the water like an island thinkin she on the dock
so she puttin in work im thinkin she on the clock
uh slow down baby girl what you tryin to prove
when you live like me its funny what one night can do

is you niggas out your mind
is it hard to recognize when you out your prime
maybe they cant imagine livin life without that shine
walk around hollywood like you so in demand
but when the labels stop backin nigga so do the fans
nigga you aint a superstar no allure about you
and when you talk about me it says more about you
wonder why when i aint around niggas change they tone
thats the way it looks
do they really think whatever they say behind my backll manage to stay put
we know the same people go the same places
from the same hood can only be so evasive
when youre from where im from youre gonna probably need the chrome
it aint just me its like that where we all from
thought some of them niggas just do it out of boredom
some just preppin for the day they see a war come
hangin in the wrong place if you never saw one
i dont know who you done dealt with in the past
better be self sufficient ma you dont get a pass
cause your thighs a little thick and you got a little ass
you lookin for a sugar daddy then go for it
twenty somethin years old with nothin to show for it
talkin about she was raised different
well get your own pockets bitch  so was i
now really come along c come come along
similar to scriptures similar to pictures
you can stick to rap what we doins much bigger


last thing im tryna be is the good guy now
i aint never gave a fuck why should i now
this shit im talking bout right here
let me tell you niggas something
you can be anything in this world that you want
except for my downfall

im a victim of society circumstance or just feelings
was a nigga victimized or just willing
no blinds no bags just dealing
no foundation or floor plan just building
check it nights bright but the days dark
covered in tattoos but hate art
these eggshells i walk on are razor sharp
staring at the finish line looking for a way to start
ive been called everything an extremist
is that a bad thing or what they really mean is
anything a nigga do a nigga mean it
and i wont let a person place or thing come between it
an opportunist is how they paint me
but if the nigga only knocks once can you blame me
still i feel like my problems are great
shit if i dont never solve em im straight
on the bright side god choose me to put a lot on my plate
so he had to figure i wouldnt be bothered by the weight
im trying to change the pattern but its on loop
even an outcast in my own group
whats it mean when eybody standing next to you expects of you
everything that comes wit a spectacle
if everywhere i go i just leave behind residue
tell me trust me i wont think nothing less of you

no moment of clarity
the next fight showing is a rarity
severity in me against my growin popularity
rappers wont rap im forced to believe they scared of me
but can no longer use the scape goat they not aware of me
so yall can go and throw your little pot shots
some dudes dissed me and temporarily got hot
im getting my head right recollecting
yall looking for some website resurrection
being that i got too much to lose
or maybe a slight chance that a nigga guilty of all that im accused
no longer amused affected my loved ones
now they startin to bruise
and i dont want no parts of that abuse
wouldnt wish upon my worst foe a day in my shoes
thatll just eliminate any excuse
and why entertain em
old me woulda lost my senses yall just helping the new me regain em
been punched in the face
it was either feed my family or hunt wit the thirtyeight
i aint want brunch to wait
ive out grown hip hop it turned into a day care
so next time some shit is on my mind itll stay there
im staring at the man in the mirror
but it aint helping see the man any clearer
so i get mia from around yall
till god stops answering these prayers for my downfall

tell me what am i to do
if i aint have a soul a nigga always had you pardon due
but i gotta speak candidly
how the fuck could you abandon me
wit five years of blood sweat and tears
but it was obviously a disconnect
we turned that into a disrespect
said she been holding it inside for years shes unhappy
so the girl i wan marry was afraid to come and tap me
so i went away on tour and you went on one of your own
but while you was on the horn all day wit ol boy
did you ever think about what it would do to your home
whats his name wheres he live
what is it he offers whats he got to give
and i love you so much that when i caught on to your fibs
i hit you like a man you wore it in your ribs
i was heated
but had to be strong enough to remove the infidelity and see whats underneath it
come to find out you felt lied to and cheated
mistreated and kept it a big secret
or are you just loose
and im so naive im tryna give you an excuse
now that i refuse to believe we life partners
holy water on whatever devil come and try to part us
cant use anything i ever gave you to bury me
you supposed to be the one to bury me
you wan leave then goodbye
think the grass look greener on the other side but its dye


look we gon need more than a block we monopolizing
nah im not rapping im prophesying
quite simply seat back diamond white bentley
approach it i might empty since i never gave a fluck
aint nothing you can say that might offend me
not when only reason shortys in the ride is to karrine me
when you do a little better they begin to hate ya
so i keep animals with me its just in my nature
if you dont wanna hear the real then i aint finna make ya
you just keep hearing whats coming from them incinerators
but when they show the hatred is when you know you made it
me i been to hell and back the shit is over rated
but every day could be your last so if trouble met me
hell be with a few of viagras and a couple beckys
you want a crash course know the damages
i promise yall that if i got high id smoke canibus
from best to worst from legend to barely here
since they repod your prime this shit aint really fair
losing his mind somebody better set him straight
lost buckingham palace now its section eight
in zero point two why rep that hard
and who the fluck dug him up from wyclefs backyard
but off him not a part of you is trife
and you cant afford the drama when your arsonals a knife
no heart in you to survive nigga living like an orphan
beefing bout new jersey but you living in new orleans
i aint even got to stab you far from a threat
i dont get why a hitman felt he needed to holla at you
come to rapper shit you real bad at matching wits
im better with a badder bitch how im not the catalyst
when the shots finish flying i bury the biscuit
i fall off the same day tyler perryll miss it
but what stifles me is how you sit back and idly
call this a rivalry when your idols me
how you throw a shot at everything you try to be
sad part is nothing in your life coincides with me
now tell me thats your strategy son
the clips extended they looking like natalie nunn
sayin we can blow the shotties how is he supposed to stop me
as a hobby i get high inhaling decomposing bodies
and if you decide to cross joe ill be waiting with a crossbow
and feed his torso to my baby cane corso
shit has gone far enough its time to finish this
should stop starting chess matches gainst the limitless
friends with my foes so my peers are annoyed
everyday they just watch me cry tears of joy
i dont care for the ploy came up from being hella broke
you think the fans are buying music im selling hope
heres some insight homie fuck making a friend
my funeral gon be by invite only
by chance im going to hell maybe for selling dope
i want my own table sectioned off with a velvet rope
might want to see heaven might need a telescope
a girl to restock anytime the wine cellars low
bottle service maybe a couple whores
high ceilings flat screens and double doors
im not a cult member im not a worshipper
just a jers nigga trying to have a couple words with her
strollin through the hood til she seem outta place
used to niggas blowing her up thatll cling to her waist
me ive never been a nigga that a fiend had to chase
ask for gucci all you gon get is cream to the face
so i put my g stacks up against your little weed stash
a one time only event wont get a recap
aim it at his knee caps have niggas in your crib
when you get home your lil girl in the back they think its tcap
so yall can put all the blaming on me
but keep in mind this is training for me tah


check it when the night falls and the smoke clears
millions of miles away yet they so near
i remember memories so im never lead astray
when tomorrow comes i know its only due to yesterday
without a boundary  check my latitude
new attitude see im grateful for having gratitude
im not complacent  but got no regrets
few hating niggas wanna see me regress
deep breath life is too short for me to be stressed
interpret ice grilling as their way of saying hes blessed
you wanna hate i got my own show be my guest
remember doctors used to tell me i was depressed
at the time was dating a model with double d chest
i thought til she laughed that shit off and said theses fs
before i bought my first gun was already armed
teach you about couth little bit of class heavy charm
used to give my last for a nice chain heavy charm
high school dropout but went to every prom
now everyone i went to high school with
now they thirty years plus still on some high school shit
seems like all the fly niggas and bitches that was well off
is junk head high niggas all the bitches fell off
from surgery rapping for niggas that never heard of me
burglaries dapping up niggas that want to murder me
if you close minded i call that an emergency
blind fold yourself as if theres nothing more to further see
honestly thats absurd to me
if the sky is the limit then wheres the urgency
i embrace life  im so carefree
but i wont judge yall if you dont care to be
just know no matter who you are
the right system  turn a role player to a superstar
im talking rock bottom a whole nother tier
stuck in the moment made me move through a whole nother year
howd i become straight forward
no baggage yall can run from the past im a make my way towards it
like  nigga i remember stage fright
back when i aint know if i could rock the stage right
who knew id end up being the nicest
my point hard to come up short when shit is priceless
hard to come up short when shit is priceless

i say this with all certainty people wanting the worst for me
got to wait in a long line its not a first for me
most of my defects have been put in my past
if you only see what i have then you overlooking my path
if you knew about my hardships and the bloodshed
itll speak for itself  and thats enough said
i carry heavy weight who wanna try and bear it
hope to lessen it daily if you wonder why i share it
being stuck in that moment never appealed to me
you aint live my life so you cant imagine how real it be
im talking about the long haul
put me on a high pedestal  better be prepared to watch a long fall
so the trampoline i adore
got so much to say to the people i ignore
dog some moments you rather forget because they scare you
i lock onto them shits like a pit they just prepare you
photographic memory of deja vu
the way i do whatever i say i do
nigga built ford tough show facades what talent is
get a different v you aint got to dodge challenges
emotional roller coaster vivian green
every event led to living a dream  or do i live in a dream
where theres no such thing as a crisis
my point cant come up short when shit is priceless


closer than close well
closer than most
i just see so much in you
and i want a better view
i want to look deeper into you yeah

see god built everybody differently ya mean
ready for the hard part
everybody aint got the same makeup
we aint all built alike
only thing is when you put in that spot
you can ask yourself what are you built for

uh im getting ready for the hard part
this the first time me and you have been this far apart
uh not the first time that you packed
but the first time that you left first time that i just stood and watched
more like stood there shocked look at what ive done
the first time that i conceded and pride won
that was our first time in court together but not really
cuz i wasnt allowed to even look your way
thats that paper work you filed right
cant communicate with the woman bearing my child right
we both lost it shit was a wild night
unfortunately we didnt go down without a fight
always said that i wouldnt know what to do without you
loved what i knew about you not what was new about you
you step back and notice shit got realer
cuz yall are closer than most but still aint looking familiar

well fuck it this what we all wanted
so i figured fuck it i can use another crack at
so what i ran from for eight years im right back at
fucking with a major now i got my group with me
good cuz the scrutiny usually has me acting stupidly
and even though they all think that im a weirdo
when i look to my left and my right they right there though
they was naive when they said that we was all through
all walk a same path feel like we the lords group
the industry dont know the type of damage we gon cause you
same one yall called flukes is looking like war troops
at the point where even legends give respect
went from outside of the game to getting lead in by the best
cause yeah wont stop till our title they cant argue
though we closer than most still i gotta thank marshall

closer to family closer to my regime
closer to goapele i mean closer to my dreams
i was closer to the block was closer to them fiends
so nah i aint from the streets but we closer than we seem
check it closer to comfort closer to wealth
but not closer than you can afford you gotta know yourself
closer to a lead so its murder in the booth
say they closer to the real but thats further from the truth
and im closer than the people thats wishing for my demise
fuck me worry bout that sickness you got inside
figure im just a reflection of your miserable life
since you less fortunate you wanna picture him deprived
why i stay to myself and get closer to rap
cuz getting closer to you will be getting closer to that
and since thats a little ways im kinda closer to fruition
i just kick my feet back and got a chauffeur for the distance

ha joey ya mean yall throw that shit my way
right field center field left field
im a golden glove winner try it
yall throw that shit my way im totally built for this
are you though


yea
its that on top muzik
yea wait a minute

yo i left the jumpsuit on a park bench
slept there smellin like the park stench
freezin covered with a dark trench
that room more like the kryptonite to my clark kent
tired of all the iq tests and all the arguments
nurses light the candles with the calm scents
i aint been calm since they actin like i aint got any common sense
too much time spent for a godsend
so i left on my own recognizance handful of klonopins
lookin for a car jack vict preferably dark tints
seems you got to eat to get even and my odds slim
they say im a animal cannibal hannibal
lookin at my past i see how thats understandable
so you god damn right im unmanageable
everything im lookin at is a fuckin intangible
my reality is reality
they reality is all perception
in my reality thats an infection
my reality dont want no part of that detection
so i pick it up and move it to another section
they reality you would think is full of perfection
correction they reality is all deception
in reality only few will make that connection
but if you like me you know not to take that direction
if reality is dead im the resurrection
nominate myself so lets skip over the election
theyll say im the wrong selection
dont meet they expectance
but i aint lookin for motherfuckin acceptance
fuck yall expect shit the mud on ya white glove
reality is full of rules im full of objections
they reality is a big misconception
so i left just to lose my recollection but still
realestate

yo they say money makes the world go round
but it really doesnt
did i think i was in a room when i really wasnt
i thought i was on the move wasnt really budging
but you aint never wore my shoes who you really judging
some people are so judgmental ill allow that
you can judge anything but my mental
he dont know what i been through
from results of the pencil
cuts from being resentful
dont cover much of the stencil
when i couldnt walk they aint have a crutch to lend dude
so i say what i feel fuck if i offend you
some fail maybe some of succeeded
some need to be wanted some wanna be needed
i scream and yell they dont hear my call
and it seems much as i fell dont know where i fall
not at all im just actin out fate
but aint much change since i escaped all i know is


check it  if all else fails i get back to what i know
ratchet for my foes  watchin for informants take a stab at it with snow
long john jacket for the cold some habits are hard to outgrow
i work so hard you think the studios my lodge inn
if all else fails
i dont have a doubt that id be back in that studio apartment
gettin it in closet size living room and the kitchens my den
playin lotto hopin numbersll save the day
back to price checking back to layaways
since i aint never hit nothin like a bad fadeaway
back to the corner takin a bag of haze to face
basic flow when i tried to get my cake to grow
i hit the pawn shop and turn into trader joe
sheisty kid yack ya jewels while they glistenin
snatch the hearing aid from a senior while they listenin
if all else fail dont know where id be
scratch that probably at home nowhere to be
or probably fuckin a broad that i treat like a floor mat
ugly enough to cover her face when a gauze pad
and thats a step down from my new york rat
that ride it like a horse back  with the horse back
but it wont fail so if you try to rob the kid
banana clips by the bedll put a stop to it
nevermind that first you gotta beat the guard
i can change the channel on my tv and see the yard
if it all failed im ready for the scam
forgin fake checks screamin catch me if you can
if all else fails id be out pullin jerz capers
knowin me id be best friends with my worst haters
uh id be dustin off the ar or be behind state bars for jackin a bait car
if all failed id be right back in them block cyphers
just to show these local niggas im a lot nicer
cause the less you succeed the more you loved for it
while the more you achieve the more you snubbed for it
if all else failed and my pockets were empty
everything i despised id probably envy
ignorant shit rappers floss that offends me
cause i wouldnt be able to attain it it would tempt me
frontin in my mans maserati
i might bag somethin with a modest body from a college party
next morning hungover so she cant remember
i would deck my whole crib out from rent a center


uh i got bitches on my dick i dont want em near
closet full of brand names i dont wanna wear
everybody got advice that i dont wanna hear
world in your palm but you dont wanna share
still im followin you   are you leadin me with a weapon drawn
co dependent on her but got me in bed alone
you say if you love it let it go nothin set in stone
plus every rock they throw i use as a stepping stone
got questions say the answers better left unknown
though i may not never see you i should know you never gone
you sayin follow my lead follow follow my lead
brought me to my knees he must wanna holla at me
when the world feel like swallowin me
when every decision costly and i aint got a dollar on me
check it i dont wanna pretend i dont wanna live a lie
i dont wanna be judged dont wanna be criticized
i dont wanna talk theres nothin i wanna say
the more i let em get to know me the more they just run away
and that must be your way of sayin we should stay together
i know how to fuck it up more than i can make it better
i figured folk around me would learn to take it better
instead of tryin change me ive been this way forever
time will reveal more will be shown
you pushed it i thought the door closed on its own
but uh nevermind what caused it
livin a dream nothin in this world powerful enough to pause it sing

hes sayin follow my lead follow follow my lead
cig in my mouth prescription bottle by me
and even when i think you might be makin a mistake
i may not know the destination but i make it there safe
check it when i feel like i cant get weaker uh
you always come and make a cameo or feature
im good with my insanity and fevers
cause pacs lookin from heaven sayin they aint understand me neither
a lot of times you leave me exposed
and laugh at me still thinkin i could be in control
help me weather the storm altogether i aint know him
cause i always disagree though you aint never been wrong
listen i was feelin nearly unstoppable
and now im facin what appeared to be impossible
feelin unimportant enough to have to bother you
but im down here alone nigga all i got is you

check it  i cant fit it all in a sixteen
the night that i was tipsy and all them bullets just missed me
the day they rushed the block i was strapped but they didnt frisk me
why i aint fuck that stripper dont ask and now shes sick b
the drop on that jewelry store for fifty
and i backed out last minute like nah this shit look risky
one of my mans dead the other one in poughkeepsie
another one in the feds hell be there until hes sixty
i want to thank you for the blessings and the gifts
and the lessons and the messages they left i get the drift
fuck the cheddar or whatever it dont measure up to this
i mean never did i ever not remember you exist
when i hop up out my bed hands together and i wish
swear to you its from the heart inside my chest you let it tick
i love you from the soul with every spiritual molecule
fuck twitter all a nigga gotta do is follow you


look i was always told you cant make it make sense dont trust it
so ill be out the country with the phone on fuck it
grown from when i was dusted
but took something away out of every moment i suffered
so yall can go on and judge it
theres a reason that im tellin baby girl she gotta practice patience
i plan on changing my ways im just procrastinating
putting it off like ill never be in a casket layin
with both my parents going crazy as the pastors praying
prideful i dont even succumb when im defeated
all it do is get me mad and im comfortable heated
i come from a family of drunks im the one that succeeded
so nowadays i talk to god when nothing is needed
im sorry i dont speak the language of
rappers in the closet but they wont hang it up
im only trying to build what they attempt to destroy
we had a perfect game until it was jim joyced
check it what was once so majestic
is now only adored by epileptics
i record to resurrect it by my own accord i cant accept it
but when something gives you nightmares can you afford to recollect it
if you can just know them odds stacked
airplanes aint shooting stars you cant bob that
i found out when discussing paper
some will sell their soul and deal with the repercussions later

so sick its livid all pics are vivid
a stip of being gifted gotta be equipped to live with
his critics misquote him and miss tidbits
so hes mislabeled misunderstood misfitd
anytime i was misinformed or misguided
i went and got advice from a dude that wouldnt apply it
and hell give out that lesson for free
without a grudge but i keep the past present with me
so every morning on the wake up as shes applying make up
how can the fans think us rappers are invincible
cant find anything about that logic thats sensible
im thinkin they should know better off of principle
to them were action heroes to labels were expendables
my whole approach was apprehensible
some started thinkin their fifteen minutes of fame was extendable
they dont cherish the moment like they probably should
once they stars submitted they act hollywood
gwapped up stacks to grip
now youre being chauffeured in the back of whips life styles immaculate
out of touch with reality ill help you get a grasp of it
success breeds change but so does a lack of it
the homies sending out subliminals
since you a failed rapper failed criminal four bars is the minimal
since you aint from the streets ill help and tell you the way it works
say a nigga snitching im saying show me the paper work
i dont get why the inferior bother to diss me
heart of my city when i go take a part of it with me
i think god will understand that was part of my misery
so instead of father forgive me its father ya dig me
spectated just to see if id get checkmated
less progress brings less hatred which would segue way it
i learned the hard way somethings are better kept sacred
fail at given em your all youll just be left naked


if i had a choice i rather my higher power decide to take me first
i think the other way around would only make me worse
rarely was i ever trusted without the suspicions
and very few could ever love me without some conditions
those the ones i care to treasure ones i wouldnt dare sever
a bunch of my peers efforts been fair weather
if the deaf got great vision and a blind man could hear better
figured since i lost all my senses that i would fair better
im not the social type nothin about him socialite
designed the prototype how to unlove overnight
flip side i die for my niggas put it the simplest
you give me your all and im a send it back with interest
this for my niggas thatll help me before i suggest it
im just tryin to send the flowers before you congested
the man in fact that ive become yall had a hand in that
and ill give yall the world but im sure that yall would hand it back

i meanshe was on the phone tryin to sound relaxed
but the words comin out her mouth aint have the sound to match
voice tremblin as if you were barely holdin on
meanwhile tryin to be strong to protect your second born
shit was scary to me
if somethin happened to you itll happen to us like im livin vicariously
i seen your life flash right past my reaction buried deep inside
if you go theyll have to bury me alive
how would i survive fuck a mom you meant more
life coach and mentor just a grim thought makes my skin crawl
single mother held it down when my pop was locked away
cried every time i gave my mom a gift on fathers day
but ill be there for you like you was there for yours
as she was layin decayin all her days spent prayin
gospel music playin
a few days from death but always felt us on our way in we was like her safe haven
you always thought you were her least favorite child
only sibling that showed up to at least make her smile
at least make her proud not an obstacle thats too hard
true stars strive to be half of the person you are
aint never neglect so ill forever respect
i more than owe my life to you im forever in debt check
i mean my mother got cancer in her neck
but ill be right behind you every step what the fuck did you expect

im like damn how you always know better than me
amazes me when you show me what i never could see


check out your man who came up around the dope boys and backstabbers
a dropout whom some referred to as a backpacker
dude they used to laugh at member him
bad rapper exactly why being on the cover of that mag matters
i chop it up with some artists i used to beef with
glad we all grew to see how played out beef is
besides that aint something were all willing to afford
when your talented you try to get a million out of more
made a killing on tour so while im wheelin that azure
im wishing all my black youths could know the feeling i endure
for some folks my ceiling is their floor
wondering where id be if i aint feel like persevering anymore
look what time does need a reality check
itll remind us you cant run from it itll always find us
and thats the game i respect it
rockin a different watch but it gives the same message

look i used to see her on the tv
now she textin how she miss me and she need me
its funny i remember when she couldnt take it
now when she get naked
look at ya man washed up
lookin like he needs to wash up
fell off now he just watch us
was playin ball something happened to the weight
tried the dope boy shit but i guess the same applied
had a short fall from grace how the fucks you a critic
damn near thirtyfive how the fucks you in a civic
rimmed up tryna stunt lookin ridiculous
and he be dead sober with them drunk lookin bitches
frail ass nigga life movin slow snail ass nigga
in the club before twelve ass nigga
and the nigga used to knock me now his shit is just sloppy
catch him in some jeans shorts issey miyake
smoked out son you aint get the memo
still believing your own hype still making demos
no grind which lead to a short prime
but homie aint got a watch how he gon know the time


joey talk to em
hoping my true motherfucker know this be the realest shit i ever wrote
its its that on top muzik
i be at the mall walk up in the store
glance up at the wall pick out a few kicks
i need elevens in these
matter of fact while you at it bring em in a size six
i take shortys shoes off
like here try on these js make sure them shits fit
but in my head it gets thick sayin
joey fall back cause thats not your kid
i dont know you lil nigga and plus i got a son of my own
but hes at home and the ways hes being raised i dont really condone
naw cause his pops been gone fuck it
ill explain it to him later when hes grown
old enough to have a phone
askin why mommy hate me
and he got the sneak to call me whenever hes alone so
you wouldnt know it but i got a soft spot for you
see we would shared the same obstacles
looking from the outside may seem like you neglect him
but when he slips up and calls me dad i correct him
i protect him when baby girl start ventin about you i say respect him
and though it seems out of order
my own mistakes have turned me into your biggest supporter
fast forward you wouldnt believe
how i could love like mine what i didnt conceive
tryin to help him reach shit what i never achieved
am i doin it for him or is it my own greed cause see
me and my baby moms we dont do the conversations
son cramped in the back two bedroom shack
with seven people livin there just congregatin
so when your child with me im over compensatin
im talkin eight bedrooms seven baths
my son thinkin thats the shit that only heaven has
mines gotta keep it cool yours get to see the view
white marble around the ground heated pool
mines got to go to the y
shit yours just got to walk outside
and the irony of it all and its just sad
is you walked away yet im the step dad
and then you get on skype sayin how you being whats the word
and i be on the background listenin like
this motherfucker here got some nerve
he says bye daddy i love you
i be wantin to snuff you but wouldnt want him thinkin less of you
but hes perceptive and this shits wild
he picks up on everything and hes just a child
so through all my resistance
im afraid this two year old can already see the difference
he sees you dont provide when youre capable
why we never fix things while were still able too
so youre annoyed it kinda of hampers me
get my boy i always wanted a family
just to greet when i get to the door
you gon have to take the l i cant give you yours
ill do all the work you aint gotta be bothered
you can be his dad ill be his father
i relate though so i know it hurts


check it
more questions more answers
more ci smoke and more cancer
more arguing more resistance
its seems like the closer we get its more distance
more angles a million different looks
was on the same page just in different books
theres so much i want to say but i got no ground
how we go from thoughts of marriage
thoughts of me copping karats
talks of what wed name her while shopping for a carriage
but when the dream stopped who knew youd see me like a savage
that you dreamt of vacations but only woke up with baggage
all you ever did was love me and look at where it got you
and when you wanted more all i did was say im not you
im selfish not selfless and i say that with love
so in essence youre asking for what im incapable of
so now i find im going over choices i aint even made yet
were we clouded by good times or great sex
running fast towards an unknown fate
you cant see how you ever began to like a liar
you lost track of all the little things that i admired
but when the peace left i knew we might retire
thinking man i live upstairs im something like somaya
got memories but at what point are they lost
you say we could work through it at what point is it forced
we shoulda never rushed
cause its like now we at a point where you wont never trust
and for me i cant believe thats all we ever was
the highs gone need a better buzz
cause we sleep in the same bed but we never touch
my solution to every beef is to revisit
though well have the same emotions we wont be so livid
wont be so vivid
i think your girl secretly applauded our drama
we dont need those critics
we owe it to go over our foundation with a keen eye
sad part to say you never have the same dream twice


yeah yeah
these niggas losing their minds you find that theres no reward
they say they already home its really clear they abroad
they sound like they boxed in its not just where they record
theres a cost to be a boss they cant clearly afford
swear to the lord theres guns like a audience
you put on a show my forty clearly applauds
sitting fifth row i might appear to be bored
plotting on a kanye but screaming wheres my award
balling out of control never won an espy
bout to buy a black ghost and name that shit sp
flow outta this world im coming for my moon man
you niggas slide back like that walking on the moon dance
no glitter glean handgun with a beam
have some boys follow you street fam twitter team
like you could fuck with me oh did it seem
dr king and def jam aint the only ones with a dream
im a grown ass man this kid a teen
youre a spoof of me like if hip hop did a scream
audi coupe looking good so i went and copped it
got that tt popping like a trending topic
my rides matte black my pride is that jacked
it might get ya dog shot even a cat smacked
anyway though styles dont apply to me
jeff goldblum couldnt be more fly than me
shorty say right after the suck fuck poof
you hit it on the head girl duck duck goose
you shoulda got the message that i chuck up deuce
reporting live from the beacon booth tired from the beating
had foreplay all day prepping the beat and the mic for a threesome
with my vocal bi coastal speeding til the rides totaled
mr wi fi out a franchise go to magic standby locals
watch the track bust once i show my dick size to the pro tools
i teach you how to have models screaming get behind me
e pills and maybachs aint gon matter if your tip is tiny
never mind me we could get knee deep in the beef
seek me with the heat but youll need more to keep me on a leash
heres a cc for the peeps that wanna see me in the streets
invest in rockports and be easy on your feet
give a few hammers a few semis and a few snubs
to a few crips couple vampires and true bloods
gambling in casinos have a honey handing me my c notes
the modern day gambino im careful every step i take
you the nigga walk up in a shootout with some pepper spray
thatd be the last mistake you ever made
me i chop his head off from a rooftop
and race it downstairs just to see if i can catch his fade
like groceries when im shooting at fags
make sure the breads separated and put the fruits in a bag
withstand the hatred dudes is fallin off doin all they can to save it
but everybodys run stops ask brandon jacobs
what yall call swag to me is all faggotry
fours want blast at me thatd equal more casualties
abort the strategy or get attacked with that duracell
they put in your back now thats assault and battery
you can keep the bitching to yourself
theres beams on every burner these lasers a petition wouldnt help
what good is having shooters if they the type that miss
where im from better be careful where you drive that whip
niggas put they life at risk for pies they flip
in my town ben affleck wouldnt try that shit
and if he did hed get turned around burnt down
tell the new jacks itll be a while fore they eligible to earn the crown

acid out the baggie this is more than dope flawless flow
fucking off a sign every horoscope done wore my robes
strapping up the corner cold critical
unquestioned my opponents know
i shoot like kapono watch me own the show
comatose toasted getting money while i roam the coast
stones and boats mansion homes and hoes
i deserve em both overdose
time to earn my votes watch me turn the volts
voltage through a meter this electric chair danger
yeah i see ya now make way fore it turn to diarrhea
hear a microphone will give you three of everything i wear yeah
models by the pair swear bottles private lear steer
style thats outta here rare thousands by the chair square
sleep with me you came here war with me is scary
get beat silly trying to lamp here better bring your fury heat
i got a drop damp here niggas try me barely
no one breathes i need an ants ear pressures necessary
got my mind on the cheddar kill my haters together
bury em in abundance and starve their families stomachs
paper come in my thumbage brand new fifties and hundreds
on point just like the drum is im warning them baby mothers
got the hunger of a broke rapper
kill you while im rolling up then smoke after
catch you at your show snatch ya empty out the dough faster
bentley off the scene magnum mo splasher four packer
southside nigga spitting coke at ya

nickel this is for the fronters and the naysayers
im about to scare away the drummers and the bass players
they say im out of my league on this one so when i get done
i want you to cut your fuckin ears off and twitpic em
lord i want you to leave this vicinity
you gon be around here bout long as justin biebers virginity
this is jesus identity mixed with weed hennessy kennedy king
mixed with a kill or be killed killer regime illest you seen switch
yall write all that hard shit then you fall right off its horrible
my oracle is all i offer so before i borrow your
wont be here tomorrow flow sorry i will proby
adiós my body wit somebody toast this shit just practice
sickest rapping baptist kill your pastor
steal your chapstick after that make you kiss a cactus
then take your ho make the ho give the whole clique fellatio
everyone that wasnt the whole entourage on hbo
then after that i tell her i cant do much with you shawty
i just found out i could fly to dubai and hire buffie the body
dont call us if the bitches aint flawless
if they are then we can hang like aretha franklin bra less
the drunk me can box like a sober you
the sober me be more nervous than waka flocka in the voting booth
we beef like being deep and dumping ks
you beef like lady gaga and her stylist
yall get together to look good in front of a bunch of gays
my feng shui is a pump in the desert
youll come up shorter than an asian jumping out of a trunk in the desert
while my wolfpack looks for strippers and cocaine
niggas snitching its a shame we call em male tattlers
fiends touching they noses more than url battlers
its hard to spit saliva when you spit fire so ill just
pour sugar in your gas tank put a banana in your tailpipe
ah ha so the car can fit the driver


i can take you all over the world though
even tell you pack light
the last slide couldnt even get a cab ride
she dont do the blogs but if she did shed be on mad sites
ass so mean that im always on her bad side
uh now she dont ever stress me bout my whereabouts
never seems concerned
with other birds that she may hear about
she mind hers since mines hers
that shit she barely care about
look amazing on me why im always tryna wear her out
she dont ride like you no she dont taste like that
not with a waist like that do i let her go to waste like that
she a mix between kama sutra yoga and porno flicks
funny how her breath get shorter when i give her long dick
uh and im telling yall straight up
might think i imagined shorty even when she not made up
she kill em in levis see why it aint even fair
look good in whatever she wear
how could other women compare they cant

i can see the stars in the day time
bitch i miss you like a deadline
and the girl im with is just the girl im with
i mean its working out so were staying fit
but you know love is nothing ask stan smith
but i gotta keep a bad bitch like brad pitt
remember our first kiss or our last kiss
i used to go dummy in that pussy crash test
you be fuckin that nigga like you was fucking me
ha fuck that nigga he cant fuck with me
im tunechi bitch and you know that
and that pussy throw back
but any given night id still pop that ass like a prozac
girl you know you got that murder a beast in that la perla
and every time we cut i used to shred her ninja turtles
and i know you still love me and i know you still for me
thats why we still fuckin
cause she dont put it down like you

love being around mine no downtime
still nothing else even matters
cant even walk slow through that mall
cause paparazzi running after
baby girl working it like a pro slow it down or move it faster
whether them lights on or them lights off
like im sleeping with the clapper
say she watching what she eat yet that ass keep getting fatter
how im sexing her
makes that ex of hers no longer be a factor
plus her and i already know you done turn them all to casper
climb with the former rather latter
you already know which one id rather cum on


i mean we started with love the beginning was magical
then it ended abrupt hows it us that this happened to
was it all just a lie how was none of it factual
even in our demise it seems im always attached to you
they said if you let it go if its real it comes back to you
she just called me a thief i took it never gave back to you
after all that ive done figured youd have some gratitude
look how far we fell off we cant even be casual
guess we both had times we were being irrational
we both out of our minds how are we not compatible
say i pushed you out the door and you did what you had to do
now you play the victim like i wasnt impacted too
should be a movie star ma you so good at acting new
you like us as strangers me i think its impractical

i mean we started with love then we ended with hatred
the whole world in our business clearly nothing was sacred
i know you down to your core unless for years you just faked it
i know all of your flaws see your soul when you naked
now you got a new squad all them bitches is basic
and even if they aint it aint hard to mistake it
i think you running from love with me you gotta face it
are you guarding your heart


last word check it unbeatable force insurmountable object
bull shouldve known better than counting me out im from the projects
so if i ever do it for greed indeed something is wrong
prepare for the future remember i used to get heat from the oven on
they wanted to see budden gone fiendd out on sour
but nobody helped put budden on had to bring my own power so
im having a private party that only myself attends
and if the dj plays the song to my soul itll give itself a cleanse
they telling me all the pain i ever felt was self infringed
but i had help from friends one even held the syringe
architect of my own path id like to think its designed the best
defied the odds i never aged while giving time a test
no niggas on house arrest im on a minor rest
you trying to call me or text me dont even bother
im trying to give mind a rest
i got a treasure but its content is invisible
was filled before with shit that i thought i treasured but made me miserable
my affairs together here forever yeah im back to work
learned in order to lose love probably gotta have it first

my lifes a crap shoot my dice are loaded aint no stopping me
most interesting man a hard place is between a rock and me
im torn within and my eyes are heavy
im born again just means i died already
means i survived already so fuck they want with me
world been against me so long misery hates my company
isolated my whole life not many know who joseph is
in order to reciprocate love you gotta notice it
gotta recognize it gotta feel it first
gotta be let inside it feel its hurt and then kneel to its worst
if you contain it dont hide it gotta reveal it first
and when you think you hit rock bottom gotta feel it worse
or my rule book is just dated
and for you to truly appreciate it you gotta at least be hated
mama i made it if anyone know my way was hard
they prayed for my downfall on deaf ears i was praying to god
so god i loved love till it resented me
and if its still a stranger then i love who it pretends to be


i said all that ill say so i stand with no apologies
ive popped all that i popped wasnt too recently that it got to me
those of yall that love joe gotta admit the shit was a lot to see
today i take all of the credit like i did away with modesty
i lost weight lost faith i got caught up in that vacuum
my stomach turned and my eyes burned and i became best friends with the bathroom
today it takes all the strength i have inside for me to avoid the rush
face pokered over the toilet all you hear is a royal flush
was under the control though they warned me about addiction
mine manifested again in the form of a prescription
and its funny what the effects of that little pillll do
funny shit that keeps you alive can also kill you
but its my life guess im stuck in it
sometimes i wanna just be normal like them other kids
the demon i battle with every night is simply drugs and shit
but ill runaway from it all if god deems that ive had enough of it

uh it go
how come they can roll yall tell me how come they can smoke they can drink
they get to do whatever they want and it dont interrupt the way they think
they all get to be regular why is it only me this odd
me who cant even stand up straight me who cant even keep a job
maybe im asking for too much a tiny piece of normalcy
or an answer to any one of my fucking prayers thats asking whats wrong with me
maybe im tired of being unique tired of being that outcast
im tired of me being the only one so tired of you all not knowing about that
im tired of it all want me to fall a spectacle for the crowd to see
or being the only one with faith im tired of everybody doubting me
im tired of responding to grown ass folks that think so motha fuckin childishly
aches wish i could take my parents genes the fuck up out of me
tired of wanting to run somewhere tired of having to bare it all
tired of you fucks constantly taking from me and im willing to share it all
tired of being objective im tired of having to hear it all
but being alone is the only way i know to never be near it all


feel like i have dated every woman in the world
most were beautiful
some were corporate
worked in a little cubicle
i done some shit to some that i would never do to you
cause some were tailor made but still wasnt suitable
come to yours i see why you be elusive
some took advantage off you some were intrusive
some put they hands on you some were abusive
most cheated on you must they think you were exclusive
aint gotta say a word i already know it
even if you scared to death its ill that you never show it
i go to sleep with fear of losing you dont wanna blow it
and i wouldnt be surprised if i did thats typical joe shit
i lie forever
not only do she trust me her body is a work of art
theres a beauty in every ugly
so for me as a friend though our past is so horrible
together well never have to see em again
i love you

ive been with every woman in this world except a virgin chick
some kept my soul alive just so they can murder it
were both broken pieces both been hurt and shit
both took a chance on each other and it was worth the risk
she low maintenance but she deserves a grip
give her the best of me cause she endured the worst of it
she been through so much still she carry on
so if she comes with baggage its a carry on
so in life without i couldnt conceive
i tried to dump her one time but she wouldnt leave
and i aint want her to so that was good to see
soon as i uttered the word i damn near couldnt breathe
been trough the run around took her off the carousel
still in shock that her passions unparalleled
i know some exes must be mad as hell
but we were so broken down we had to gel

ive been with every type of woman some of the baddest ones
some were cougars but still they acted young
some were gossip queens but i aint mad at them
you make bittersweet today that shit matters none
some i knew wouldnt last when that crash begun
some played it cool but wasnt half as fun
some aint over me they just blame away
some i ruined myself others came that way
some were modelesque left started gaining weight
other waited to gain but met the same fate
some moved to the city for a change of pace
some i never broke up with just let it fade away
some never witnessed love dont know what we see in it
was a stranger for you so its ill how you believe in it
cause you done dated a few
if imma take a chance on love i thank god he let me take it with you

the time is now zoom get close
the ego is gone the room is for growth
but talent is there the feeling is new
i mean bottom is gone but the ceiling is too
i was higher than whitney headed toward the top again
everything i write crack like its with a bobby pen
but its more than what you hear in a song
the wings are extended the fear is gone
hold up the clips are loaded safety is off
the business is in the black i aint taking a loss
hold up standards are high hoes never hold out
the touring is cool the shows always sold out
the foes are mad but fuck it no one else cares
the kicks are custom youll never see em elsewhere
the stakes are high the risk is crucial
and they love to hate me but i love it when they do too

look ive been hurt i could pull up scars
now the earth is my pull up bar
the journey was long the roads were slim
though i thank god today i probably owe it to sin
streets were hungry i was torn apart
even though them jails were cold they warmed my heart
was living the worst but prayed for the best
aint have a thing given to me had to rape success
had to be used for approval had to use whatever was useful
had to act old even when youthful
money dont make me that aint what i kill for
cause i was richer than id ever been and was still poor
some never thought he would propel
some talked to me just to speak to themselves
some broke their arm all while reaching for wealth
so when you come into the game make sure you leave with yourself
joey

we all got demons a few i rivaled
looked em in the eye and they became suicidal
they thought it couldnt happen they were too prideful
his heads an ornament on the wall as proof i survived you
bills were high money was low
strip club was popping wasnt money to go
going nowhere fast but drugs was a one stop
couldnt shine selling that tan i had my son blocked
now im on acres in a house with a loft
the women are foreign their blouses are off
its a whole new me i redefined my style
and since yesterdays gone i guess the time is now


you can tell him that we best of friends or we just met
tell him that you hate my guts that was just sex
can say we never kissed those were just pecks
tell him put your phone down that was just a text
or tell him you cherish our bond on the weekly
or how you jump in my arms when you see me
tell him i threw on the charm it was easy
its to the point now where your mom wanna meet me
tell him i think youre beautiful
tell him all the wild shit that i do to you
would he approve of that or would his world be shattered
and if you didnt care would it really matter
wait could say it aint the ride or the whips
but tell him the size of the ship
or just tell him you were tired of his shit
and i reminded you of how live it gets

tell him you dont feel appreciated
tell him with me its alleviated
incomparable
how i do things that he wouldnt dare to do
or act like i dont care to take it there with you
wait as a matter a fact
tell him he could be mad at the fact
you finally met a nigga that aint mad at your past
or tell him he can be mad at the past


ghetto burbs im from the ghetto of jerz
from where the peddlers serve use hand gestures for words
big up to la they was ahead of the curve
my hood we gangbang you can get left on the curb
yep i was raised here but im tryin to export
police is crooked the strippers is escorts
like my homie layla really i cant knock her
cause she gettin paper month ago she was knocked up
baby daddy a dope boy fresh home he was locked up
but he on the same shit fucked around and got shot up
in my same mind im like why he even bother
at the same time dont know what he was a part of
layla over the casket tears coming harder
the hood wins again another son with no father
gotta take it in stride round here thats the usual
but i aint accustomed that shit i cant get used to
im trying to survive

from where the ghettos disturbed you can be dead in a hearse
say a prayer daily and end it with better or worse
i lost faith but grandma still keep her head up in church
murder rate sky high employment is real low
little kid try to rap but will he get a deal no
cause poverty kills slow belief is beyond you
seven out of ever ten bitches here got the monster
like my little homie tanya i met her at freaknik
freak shit the same bitch them niggas be all out in the street with
open in love with the service
but she got resentments you wont see from the surface
feel like so many women look great so she worship
caught aids from rape thought her whole life was worthless
ho couldnt know how gorgeous her curves is
she fucking em raw and hope to catch it on purpose
you better survive

i aint tryin to act like my part of the ghettos the worst
niggas is tricks here theyll buy stilettos for birds
how did i get here they act like the metal dont hurt
you just getting high guess they trying to escape it
or commit suicide assuming they couldnt take it
the streets is cold still we run around naked
success is a void and we replace it with hatred
thats your homie from way back from so many years old
but friends turn green even that acted weird old
you think he cared no yall used to share clothes
now you struggle for rent and he got ice in his earlobes
your man wont even extend a hand meeting all his career goals
you need a whole nother plan your careers froze
valuables are more valuable
than everything even value to dude
cause you gotta survive


i can take you all over the world though
even tell you pack light
the last slide couldnt even get a cab ride
she dont do the blogs but if she did shed be on mad sites
ass so mean that im always on her bad side
uh now she dont ever stress me bout my whereabouts
never seems concerned
with other birds that she may hear about
she mind hers since mines hers
that shit she barely care about
look amazing on me why im always tryna wear her out
she dont ride like you no she dont taste like that
not with a waist like that do i let her go to waste like that
she a mix between kama sutra yoga and porno flicks
funny how her breath get shorter when i give her long dick
uh and im telling yall straight up
might think i imagined shorty even when she not made up
she kill em in levis see why it aint even fair
look good in whatever she wear
how could other women compare they cant

i can see the stars in the day time
bitch i miss you like a deadline
and the girl im with is just the girl im with
i mean its working out so were staying fit
but you know love is nothing ask stan smith
but i gotta keep a bad bitch like brad pitt

i used to go dummy in that pussy crash test

ha fuck that nigga he cant fuck with me
im tunechi bitch and you know that
and that pussy throw back
but any given night id still pop that ass like a prozac
girl you know you got that murder a beast in that la perla
and every time we cut i used to shred her ninja turtles
and i know you still love me and i know you still for me
thats why we still fuckin
cause she dont put it down like you

love being around mine no downtime
still nothing else even matters
cant even walk slow through that mall
cause paparazzi running after
baby girl working it like a pro slow it down or move it faster
whether them lights on or them lights off
like im sleeping with the clapper
say she watching what she eat yet that ass keep getting fatter
how im sexing her
makes that ex of hers no longer be a factor
plus her and i already know you done turn them all to casper
climb with the former rather latter
you already know which one id rather cum on


shoulda never put me on this beat
okay yeah normal baller
we back on tizzy on top
jump off dub b jersey

jump off you rap guys is a joke
im here to take the scoring title without the green light from my coach
man dont make me have to smack your lineup
im michael jordan yall harold minors that rap vagina
all black ski mask gloves tuck the thing
drive slow lights out like i love this game
i live this yall paint that pic
and like magic im starting to believe yall dudes aint that sick
might see ya boy scooping up a bird to get knowledge
number one draft pick and i skipped college
snakes in the trenches i peep those get injured
end up like grant hill on the bench in your street clothes
talk about he real how he quick with a glock
but like kurt thomas he aint good for shit on the block
see the gleam from the shoes
man i dont mean to seem rude
gunshots do you like vancouver make your team move

cant treat me like a sucka
gather up your five man meet me at the rucker
put the heat to you fuckers
half man half amazing with a clip in my boot
my four point five will make you skip to my lou think about it
understand when i was younger i was all on my own
so when i said three point two i wasnt calling a zone
nice truck nice house and chain
i car jacked you like shaq shooting a three man get outta your range
this is regular hood shit
i put don cheaney under the arm and show him how to make a good nick
if you wack you need to probably write
either that or quit it throw in the chair like you bobby knight
i work damn hard
but dont think i cant rob
cant pitch i still handle the rock like shammgod
still hurt you cowards
still see me merking them prowlers
and know they still call me dirk in dallas
im that nigga

man i kill lame queers
it still aint clear
never saving the tech like bill laimbeer
i got tools for rilly
with shells that make your temple hot and i aint talking bout a school in philly
i aint a selfish player
man i help your weight up
cuz only riders in this game now is myself and isaiah
listen you gettin dissed
while im screwing these misss
im on cruise control you still moving your pivot
but ill show you how mean this crook be
you and your dogs like the houston comets a team fulla pussys
creep
it aint a game no more its a sport
if you aint got heart to play then stay off the court

game over


you can catch me in a strip club stacked up i dont keep em visible
wont see a man get thirsty cause im known to keep a bitch or two
probably both be bisexual i tell them chill and kick it boo
and never get uncomfortable these waitresses start kissing you
yall would call it birthday sex i call it a ritual
if you seen it like me then i already know why yall be miserable
you dont really want no problems cause those shooters theyre hospitable
and they gon grab them blockas while you try and keep it physical
pool house or that guest house it dont matter where it goes down
driveway is cobblestone garage is like a ghost town
i aint even touch em yet they feel like theyve been hosed down
if you real then you gotta respect this shit gs up hoes down

hold up lets get back to my loved ones those of yall that been with me
helped me to exorcise my demons brought them to the gym with me
probably why she text me to death like joe i got a friend wit me
and id love to eat her out while you on top putting a limb in me
lets get back to them things i like lets get back to that stripper pole
lets get back to her popping that i aint even really gotta tip her though
its bonjour while im on tour i mean every night different show
and if you a little bit too sober just tell me your favorite liquor ho
wait tell me your favorite then lick a ho
we them dudes you wanna get to know cameras up no pictures though
looking for them broke niggas    dont aim at me there aint none
to respect my position gotta respect where a nigga came from

she know i like it when her hair curled sun dress little bit of make up on
turnpike parkway either way wont take us long
hit the club twenty minutes deuces either way im gone
be a fool if i stayed there wit an ass bouncing in my favorite thong
i came from nothing like my father was a deadbeat
wasnt for that i dont know if id say success is sweet
top of the world lets let how i sustain maintain my legacy
taking a bit of my soul but wont let it consume the rest of me
now lets get back to this paper though every day same shit
screaming rns for life some of yall dont know that language
living for you never for them best way to explain it is
i want the most because i had the least thats why im on my game biotch


our first again


our first again our first again
our first again our first again our first again

grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change
the courage to change the things i can
and the wisdom to know the difference
give me the strength to be myself
and with that well be on top of the world


my castle started shrinking somethings gotta give
ended up being the smallest place that i had ever lived
one of the reasons i would do away with fame to say the least
dont know who these people are their names aint on the lease
its a different type of monster entertainment is a beast
was supposed to eat together then i became the main feast
if you preying on my kindness taking advantage of joes cool
id have to ask whats your definition of soul food
i bust my ass for my whole life and i worked hard for my profit
and envy i know cuts like a knife so you probably work hard to stop it
if you know me like you claim then how could you disregard my logic
you know i cut my arm short and put my heart in my pocket
a pretty good judge of character maybe i mistaked a few
cut some people off but had no choice its what they made me do
why would you take advantage when its something id have gave to you
and in the long run it doesnt take from me it takes from you
youll probably tell me im a fucked up nigga
you got it wrong i just wont be fucked up with you
which forces me get distant and i never want to act a way with you
but passion and desire never blends with lackadaisical
no longer enable you thats no longer favorable
but pride is on your sleeve so youll just act like nothing phases you
which can never equal good in fact
so love cant be lost i know exactly where i put it at

my castle started shrinking i tried my best to fight it
dont know how it happened dont know how they got invited
was good with cabin fever and maybe that helped create the space
fuck your good intentions more concerned with whats taking place
but everyone feels entitled made up their mind they got a right to
my peers transforming right before my eyes into my rivals
yall can have the cars yall can have the clothes take all that shit that i dont love
im learning fast that recognition is its own drug
and whats worse than some of your actions being feminine
is i got no way of knowing if your moves are really genuine
you there when its bright better be there when its dark
you wasnt there for the ride dont be there when i park
figure i love niggas enough to let the world come and stay with me
and ill stay trapped in this room to keep yall away from me
whats supposed to happen when im not hot anymore
your job rely on me being crazy but what if im not anymore
the funny shit them mollys were cool when we all were doing em
but nobody recalled when i was the only one they were ruining
i learned a long time ago in life that not much is fair
so no love lost but not much is there
deja vu this happened rapidly before
every days a constant struggle and youre a casualty of war
which could only equal good in fact
so love isnt lost i know exactly where i put it at


these niggas lied to me way back
said this was where my buck stop
ridin right by in my fly shit
these niggas still at that bus stop
youll never see these jeans sag
you would think so with this tucked glock
and any nigga wanna go bar for bar
know im always with that club hop
this your shit yall dont know shit
them hoes you with is just average
this four spittin that whole clip and my alibi is my bad bitch
so dont be the first to get it
my life is like a movie and your bitch deserve the credit
i just stood there and directed
she just did what i expected
doin me but youd do me too
ill be me my nigga you be you
i guess that men can be groupies too
recognize a winner  live like a born sinner
catered dinners finna have a pool party in the winter
finna skinny dip bitch fuck them drawers
her brains are killer and i love em all
said my head got a price on it
she come through and just suck it off
so if you scared get a weapon
every day a nigga live like he prepared for armagedon

club like its my last day
ride like its my last day
fry like its my last day
fuck like its my last day
fuck boys wanna blast me
this might be your last day
but it wont be my last day

just sex me

full course meal now the dinner gone
closet full of clothes still nothing but the skin is on
dont matter if its your place or my place
but if mine the patio got a fireplace
trust me you aint seen shit just yet
not compared to how shit can get
me on top of you dripping sweat
and that dont matter you drippin wet
your turn on top
and you can crash here just promise me you wont stop

two rounds might lead to four
all depending on how you feel though
we suckin on you all while you bitin on that pillow
same time next week but i asked her how she feel first
said she wanted some days off since she needed to heal first
she told me smack her ass like she was actin up
i told her put it down but she backed it up
our turn one forever
arrive separate but come together


i look over my shoulder not knowing where its coming from
but knowing that its coming i was bugging as a youngin
now im runnin from something thatll even out my dumb decisions
the night i shot and had him bleeding out his lungs and spitting
do any sins go unforgiven i hope not
cause most of mine were hunger driven nothing in my mothers kitchen
stomach sounds like the clouds ignited and the thunder hitting
so the well screwed kid ended up with more than a couple missing
so not a chef but now the cocaine forever cooking
i love kids but now im selling to a pregnant woman
stumbling through the projects in the am with a cup in my hand
gun on my waist and i dont give a fuck is my plan
youll never understand my palm sweat
followed by shortness of breath then my heart jets and i aint find a calm yet
go on let shorty sing
cause aint no way in hell this aint joell thats brave enough to tell you everything

fuck all that rapping imma let the conversation rock
i got skeletons in my closet
the living dead live in a nigga head behind a combination lock
when will the occupation stop and make it a vacant lot
the black mamba when i crack vodka imma take a shot
and hope them stowaways go away before the anchor drop
yeah thanks a lot im a bottle drinking nutcase
cover of xxl behind em i had the drunk face
i steadily dream about cleaning these demons out
in order to clean them out you gotta scream and shout
all of your secrets out loud
it started as a kid at my school desk
aced every quiz but i wanted to pass the cool test
aint nothing cool about school shopping at the thrift store
and living in an abandoned station wagon because you was piss poor
so i started stealing all of the clothes that the other kids wore
thats when the skeletons moved into my mind on the sixth floor
and more came through crooked is youth
i slowly started moving them out my closet into this mic booth
for real bro

see the problem is i know it all
or maybe the problem is that i just show it all
maybe they that thinking i should be ashamed of my actions but really theres no remorse
maybe the lord will decide that i suffered enough and let me live with no withdrawals
then again all it would mean is he deemed im much too important to focus on
we could talk about pain twentyfour point seven dog thats my department
inter city blues cruise and im blasting that marvin
skeletons aint in my closet thats my apartment
and they like to hide behind thousand dollar fabrics and garments
its all bleak to me
tell my pop i aint bothered when he dont speak to me
i love you but its weak to me
on one hand life is short and theres no excuse to do it
but you was missing half my life dog im kind of used to it
modern day son of sam judge but you dont understand
me against the world i plan on winning know im undermanned
want to see through the eyes of a monster look through my glasses tint
my roommates can stay here just take care of half the rent


maybe it started with slaughterhouse or was it tour life
maybe it wouldnt had started at all if i had your life
maybe it was needed or was i thinkin immorally
if i wasnt myself could i say i gave the fans all of me
cant decide if im more ashamed of what they saw of me
than i am of ignorin all the lessons that was taught to me
headed up field but couldnt dodge the last tackler
how could a forward thinker move so ass backwards
how could a dude with no regrets at all willin to bet it all
not realize that quicker demise how could i neglect it all
im so seasonal some of yall knew id spring back
with a heart this cold howd yall think id be receptive to fall
im plenty comfortable when dangers around
and even more so when strangers around
and the bigger picture is sicker
dont know my triggers or know the alarm it forces
dont know a nigga
dont know my bouts with drugs and liquor or the harm it causes
life or death i tried to lynch myself
thought i could keep it all a secret i convinced myself
but really the folk that loved me they could tell i was locin
i couldnt see him cry me a river cause it fell in the ocean
numb to my words now maybe felt i was open
i cut so many people loose do i need help with devotion
thats just some of the things i ask my lord and savior
and when he calls for me will he have done us all a favor

im lookin around like this cant be happenin
round of applause for the angry rappers
lord my girl cried me a flood then me a river
thats love dependin on me when im independent on liquor
im up in the shoe store she got no love to show
you ever look at a bitch you was fuckin behind your bitch back
like fuck i was fuckin you for
im an artist so im intelligent
i would tell you to do some soul searching
but its hangin up in my closet with your skeleton
its gotta be a gods work
even a diamond gotta be polished first
a quarters on the loose
and i aint been out here gettin my dollars worth
i had to remove the goggles first
to see through the sippin patrón
and fifty phoners for i need to go get me a kidney donor
guru nate dogg go ahead blink an eye
your doctor told me you close go head drink and die
buried under the stone where the patrón fifth sits by
that reads here lies somebody who never wanted to be this guy

they say knowledge is power  great cause every day i learn
as of late been havin revelations bout this hate term
hate the way they judge me til i got the case adjourned
hated the belly of the beast til i became its tapeworm
when i said id stop gettin high tried to say it stern
now im the type to walk through the fire to check the way it burn
they say my brain is off  i say how can it be
if im out my mind how can i be in sanity
the people used to say that i was scared of progress
they dont know how hard a nigga tried to advance
but i dont know whos more to blame
is it them for really not knowin me
or is it me for never really givin them a chance
get too close be too big of a threat
now its been little to no time thinkin why i aint get rid of you yet
gotta recognize my maturity gotta see im grown
let all my skeletons out the closet just so id never be alone
since i got trust issues i wont discuss with you
besides god tell me who the fucks supposed to save you
pop wont have a man to man was gone half my life
so somewhere in his head probably feel it aint his place to
plus more people will see me soon
i mean ill be on national tv soon
so when i ask if people i have around are a cancer for me
thats four million more that might be able to answer for me


yeah yeah
these niggas losing their minds you find that theres no reward
they say they already home its really clear they abroad
they sound like they boxed in its not just where they record
theres a cost to be a boss they cant clearly afford
swear to the lord theres guns like a audience
you put on a show my forty clearly applauds
sitting fifth row i might appear to be bored
plotting on a kanye but screaming wheres my award
balling out of control never won an espy
bout to buy a black ghost and name that shit sp
flow outta this world im coming for my moon man
you niggas slide back like that walking on the moon dance
no glitter glean handgun with a beam
have some boys follow you street fam twitter team
like you could fuck with me oh did it seem
dr king and def jam aint the only ones with a dream
im a grown ass man this kid a teen
youre a spoof of me like if hip hop did a scream
audi coupe looking good so i went and copped it
got that tt popping like a trending topic
my rides matte black my pride is that jacked
it might get ya dog shot even a cat smacked
anyway though styles dont apply to me
jeff goldblum couldnt be more fly than me
shorty say right after the suck fuck poof
you hit it on the head girl duck duck goose
you shoulda got the message that i chuck up deuce
reporting live from the beacon booth tired from the beating
had foreplay all day prepping the beat and the mic for a threesome
with my vocal bi coastal speeding til the rides totaled
mr wi fi out a franchise go to magic standby locals
watch the track bust once i show my dick size to the pro tools
i teach you how to have models screaming get behind me
e pills and maybachs aint gon matter if your tip is tiny
never mind me we could get knee deep in the beef
seek me with the heat but youll need more to keep me on a leash
heres a cc for the peeps that wanna see me in the streets
invest in rockports and be easy on your feet
give a few hammers a few semis and a few snubs
to a few crips couple vampires and true bloods
gambling in casinos have a honey handing me my c notes
the modern day gambino im careful every step i take
you the nigga walk up in a shootout with some pepper spray
thatd be the last mistake you ever made
me i chop his head off from a rooftop
and race it downstairs just to see if i can catch his fade
like groceries when im shooting at fags
make sure the breads separated and put the fruits in a bag
withstand the hatred dudes is fallin off doin all they can to save it
but everybodys run stops ask brandon jacobs
what yall call swag to me is all faggotry
fours want blast at me thatd equal more casualties
abort the strategy or get attacked with that duracell
they put in your back now thats assault and battery
you can keep the bitching to yourself
theres beams on every burner these lasers a petition wouldnt help
what good is having shooters if they the type that miss
where im from better be careful where you drive that whip
niggas put they life at risk for pies they flip
in my town ben affleck wouldnt try that shit
and if he did hed get turned around burnt down
tell the new jacks itll be a while fore they eligible to earn the crown

acid out the baggie this is more than dope flawless flow
fucking off a sign every horoscope done wore my robes
strapping up the corner cold critical
unquestioned my opponents know
i shoot like kapono watch me own the show
comatose toasted getting money while i roam the coast
stones and boats mansion homes and hoes
i deserve em both overdose
time to earn my votes watch me turn the volts
voltage through a meter this electric chair danger
yeah i see ya now make way fore it turn to diarrhea
hear a microphone will give you three of everything i wear yeah
models by the pair swear bottles private lear steer
style thats outta here rare thousands by the chair square
sleep with me you came here war with me is scary
get beat silly trying to lamp here better bring your fury heat
i got a drop damp here niggas try me barely
no one breathes i need an ants ear pressures necessary
got my mind on the cheddar kill my haters together
bury em in abundance and starve their families stomachs
paper come in my thumbage brand new fifties and hundreds
on point just like the drum is im warning them baby mothers
got the hunger of a broke rapper
kill you while im rolling up then smoke after
catch you at your show snatch ya empty out the dough faster
bentley off the scene magnum mo splasher four packer
southside nigga spitting coke at ya

im about to scare away the drummers and the bass players
they say im out of my league on this one so when i get done
i want you to cut your fuckin ears off and twitpic em
lord i want you to leave this vicinity

then after that i tell her i cant do much with you shawty
i just found out i could fly to dubai and hire buffie the body
dont call us if the bitches aint flawless
if they are then we can hang like aretha franklin bra less
the drunk me can box like a sober you
the sober me be more nervous than waka flocka in the voting booth
we beef like being deep and dumping ks
you beef like lady gaga and her stylist
yall get together to look good in front of a bunch of gays
my feng shui is a pump in the desert
youll come up shorter than an asian jumping out of a trunk in the desert
while my wolfpack looks for strippers and cocaine
niggas snitching its a shame we call em male tattlers
fiends touching they noses more than url battlers
its hard to spit saliva when you spit fire so ill just
pour sugar in your gas tank put a banana in your tailpipe
ah ha so the car can fit the driver


if you feel like i feel its all love what up
now throw ya motherfuckin fingers in the air  yeah
mr on fact here to do it like on fact this aint about rap
if you aint come to feel good we gonna do it without you
too low turn the music louder yeah
turn the music loud in here
you understand that what yall about to hear
feelin myself homie what

nah see they wont slow me down wont slow me up
skys the limit til i die and im in it
but thats not the case tonight
pop a case tonight
like whatever you want do its okay tonight

i write mood muzik know a lot of you aint used to
jot my life on wax im puttin you through it

fans wanted the real i went and gave it to em
im not a street nigga nah just relate to em
i just relay through em
show the way to em never fake to em that aint
dont be afraid show the world who you are
go and show the world you a star
reach to the stars go ahead show the world that its ours
and then the worldll know that its
forty acres and a mule to forty ks on the mueller
see im just thinkin of ways to get my dudes up
they use to say we was losers
i beg to differ that aint me now

they say if you dont stand for nothin youll fall for anything
cause of that there i see the whole game on the ground
watchin what works we all chasin a hit
instead of takin a risk so we changin our sound now
now we all chase jewels big trucks and income
all that and then some chase whatever trend come
at least til the trends done
but that dont change within none
and im not sayin to not have a benz son
rings that shiny whatever things timely
those things help to unwind me
but naw those things dont help define me
aim at the basics aim you can make it
cause even when the whole game seems tainted
im a star without the chains and the bracelets
cause that fly shit is


two years waits up still sleep wake up
dawg so lemme help niggas understand mouse
dawg why try to fit in when you a stand out
its no album but the money never ran out
aside from rap im kinda focused on land now
cause i dont know whurr the game is
i know we jus been attacked by a hurricane chris
some niggas cant fathom what money and fame is
or some niggas get it by usin they stainless
or some niggas get it but they cant sustain it
me im regular joe i dont let it change shit


some niggas wanted to kill me got locked up and never found me
so my goal is to catch a charge in that same county
picture me gettin bumped for a silly hand off
the bullpens fucked up just ask willie randolph
see i could pop a few nickel plated glocks too
its easier to kill niggas than it is not to
i let the pot brew then the plot grew
it the labels job to label you dont fit it and theyll drop you
finally made a move on something i been saw
sometimes you got to lose the fight
if you tryin to win the war im focused on tomorrow
im done seein my friends in the rearview thinkin we really closer than we are
fuck the record label
no relation or correlation all my admiration just turned aggravation they say
how you sit so long when you spew classics
i tell niggas i cant understand thats that blue magic
the rap game as is either you on some snap shit
or plan ol stuck in a different decade like the brat is
i hear niggas joints and take it personal why
now everybody want to spit about their personal lives
before that was non existent
me im an addict with an addition for anything that seems to cause friction
maybe im in a relationship with bad karma
what her past the somber maybe i attract drama yeah
undoubtedly my life is on some vhone shit
just adding some salt and pepper to reality while
other artists is obsessed with more toys
like lex coup beemers and benzes    theyre lost boys
un i kept brushing off my shoulder till the chip was going
left the benz at the dealers till the kit was on
i dont feel niggas songs
so while yall at the awards
im loading up on ratches thats the tip im on
flow is on acid i swear i would have the game mastered
if i wasnt so busy carrying baggage
calling god a bastard
calvin look way different in person
then they had him looking in his casket
im looking in his casket like he had no face
i was at a lost for words like fiasco gate
so i figured i say a prayer for em got on my knees quick
and realized i dont ever pray until i need shit
my soul achin trying to stay low maintenance
im stuck in hell waiting on
blessing with no patience
i done made the ave hot
been had to stab shot
waiting on my jackpot
always been a have not
always been an under dog little guy still try
cause i think im a cash cow they treat me like im milk dry
juggling nickels and dime im walking a fine line
sometimes you got to just breath maybe give time time
give me a sign kind of shock he wont
see i want another baby but my pockets dont
normally that wouldnt bother me
till i wake up and get the paper and
read that some rich nigga won the lottery
young black and shameless
shorty keep beefing about the same shit
almost like yelling her second language
why do i entertain it
listen we been arguing about everything for ages do it ever change shit
wind up igging each other for the whole week
its a lot of men in this world baby you chose me like i chose you
we been rocking for years you signed up
you not a victim you a volunteer its weird
im not a cheater on occasion still fuck a bitch
who knows why maybe just to feel coveted
im me shes her we both had enough of it
but wont leave we the only ones who put up with it
in all areas its like my stocks crashing

look what up ray was speechless i aint know what to say
got the call like at eight am with nate saying
you had passed away im like why niggas stay playing
your myspace page playing it started my day aching
it hit me like a tumor felt like it was too soon to
thought it was a rumor until it wasnt a rumor
cant believe that its over
but if god called you i aint even mad at him he mustve needed a soldier
i was like your mentor you was like my friend nah
when i seen you i would treat you like my kin and more
we used to scream fuck these niggas like tim dog
you was the only rap nigga i would fend for
was fiending for beats stuck between your dream and the streets
you just wanted to be seen as elite
cause you loved far rock like i love jersey so i feel ya
but love something too much guarantee itll kill ya
for real a

you nah mean i remember we
was in the studio doing doing you know whatll happen
it was me you and cau

i went ahead and gave em mad bars you was mad as fuck
you went and tried to stretch your shit out i wasnt having it though nigga

look riot squad keep your head up
remember we would diss each other on tracks laugh about it when we met up
im looking in your casket praying a nigga get up
for a minute i couldnt help but think that you was set up
no matter who you are you got to answer when the lord calling
i told you go and fuck with jimmy thats before ballin
go get your cash right hard to slow down livin the fast life
i just heard you on flex show last night
like was it old beef or was you gettin stuck up
a line outside your funeral ran was really fucked up
and i was too but the difference is
i was more in awe at the ignorant value of life that living gets
pulled the burner on you but you fought that dude
i read the paper it said the pigs caught that dude
its sad another black man taken by a black hand
was your last night in the club we could have saved your last dance
god damn

i remember like
i remember we was in cancun
that was my first time out there in cancun
me and you was rollin together

i keep telling em pac wanted to sign you and big wanted to see you
pun wanted to cypher
l wanted you to bring some of that good kush up and get a little higher
go and help jam master jay get the crowd hyper
or maybe freaky tah switched up and needed a writer
maybe aaliyah single up there and need a rider
know you and rick james would set the studio on fire

you could be the gorgeous gangster and niggas wont hate
some niggas tapped the bottle pour out a little hennessy

and you had some bitch in your car and your car broke down

are you in that mood yet one mo gain
are you in that mood yet
look they say tomorrows not promised but if it was i wouldnt get open
wouldnt get souped them shits was made to be broken
member comin up dudes talkin bout hoes boastin
i was just a juvenile movin in slow motion
i dropped outta school to be a dude with mad jewelry
once i got it shit wasnt even cool to me
i dreamt of condos and video vixens
until i learned most girls in videos is pidgeons
i just wanted the world to see that i was for real with it
wanted a deal i got it and couldnt deal with it
i want me and my old homeboys to still kick it
i wish they saw me as mouse and not a meal ticket
let the beat play i wish i could see a day wit no he say she say just wanna see trey
wanna play the hood and not fuck with the toasters
middle child wish me and my brother was closer
i wanna scream at her catch myself before i start to
and then remember it takes two people to argue
all she do is provoke me all i do is diss her
all i did was shake her she say that i hit her
she just takin everythin i say out of context
im tryin not to black im like a nigga with a complex
was mad as a fuck didnt even show it
yesterday was better off didnt even know it
complete role reversal so its useless these days
tv got real music went fake please help her for gods sake
when i proposed to the game i figured life was merry
five years later im feelin like tyler perry
maybe im exhausted maybe i just lost it
maybe i should pick up a pen and try n force it
same old story guts and no glory they tryna low ball me do him like joe torre
why am i meeting so many back stabbers
why when im about to crash i go faster past is a disaster
when your house is see through learn to close your eyes
in case the glass shatters
just sayin its always a million more pages when my stupid ass keep
thinkin im on the last chapter
no tit for tat i aint equipped for that
back in new york chit chat with a midget mack
as i get olderi keep gettin sick of rap
wanna call it quits but a nigga cant picture that


look im on a war path
tell the opposition
naw keep it to your self im my only competition
but keep the hate coming
i love the criticism
but understand im successful by my own admission
i never had shit
but a bad bitch
naw let me stop lying mostly they was average
if youd say my voice would be heard by the masses
a dust head nigga from jerz i wouldnt grasp it
questions you can ask it
teamed up with the klasix
working on a classic smash hits and thats it
maybe niggas thought my knees gonna buckle
newport in my mouth with two gs on the buckle
got more now than them few gs when i hustle
spanish broad with them two ds like i love you
but sexy lady it was nice to know you gotta move on
they cant chink my armor a nigga to strong
i think niggas is shady but the proofs gone
i put the jewls on case fools thought it was gone youve been warned

i tried to told dudes way back in two
that eventually the game would go back to being soul food
i mean soulful while everything is woeful
i try to stay fresh like whole foods on the pro tool
but mista f a b wanna mention him

and that randy mossberg ya steve smith  wesson ya
the shoes pop up like instant messenger

and my mac you cant use for ichat
ive got that confused that with lie flat
and my gat is on leg like thigh tat

some broke niggas who tryna get some youtube views
so less you want a point blank boy youre too close
bails in pocket this is lawyer lou los
im pretty sure more hotties seen me in that four door ridey
double pipes like a sawed off shotty nigga

i flow sickly riding bumping old biggie
roll with me or lose weight nicole richie
fuck plat if i dont reach diamond fame
i treat a nigga face like that old simon game
figured out why men try us cause we od
on rims and thin tires for that we len bias
all it take is a punch he aint brave he a punk
ill put his family in boxes meet the brady bunch
how yall feel yourselves should kill yourselves
us cowboys dont need you you bill parcells
and you aint gotta empty your pockets when the ks out
whatever you holding is mine we my paypal
see i dont get how this guy is a threat
i make his life inept for a pie to the neck
ride or die i do both nigga ride to the death
i a cappella the whole left side of his chest
not retiring still got that pension pending
tryna pop the hood and see the engine missing
double barrelled shotgun how your men get missing
she got pretty brown eyes and she in mint condition
oh the cig in the car you dissin moi
take the ratchet go home and just chris benoit
tell a bird like it is you promise the broad
i one line her you isiah thomas the broad
i could send a clique cartridge at a nemesis target
and catch a ror on some jena six charges
nah ill put this thing away i dont even need a
whole hairdo to clip em all it take is one finger wave
been in the  for days show you how im real
come home to the truck with the optimus prime grill
handed out crack got the scene poppin off
they not sleepin on em the fiends is nodding off
all real tell me how you a thug and you superman
i just seen you in the club doing the superman
a bunch of clowns homes all i
need in this world is the pound chrome huxtable brown stone
major paper cake by the layers
if these dudes is live im the create a player
they callin em kings when they so so hot
somethings wrong with that picture must be photoshopped
i dont promote violence but when sparkin the flame blame
arms start waving like the carlton banks dance
when them tools go pop it move whole blocks
come around with your dog and get kujo shot
these mcs is lame i try to be a mc with brains
these niggas is mc brains
being nice rappers is far from being nice
im on the rooftop recording niggas is being sniped
its like


the soundtrack to my life is like cnn first shit
images like cnn but worse shit
i would down the whole pinot gris
but id see the group home without the primo beats
and it hurts my soul
im a warrior so though the odds is against a nigga dirk gon choke
some people confide in the person that they sleep with
ive learned theres no such thing as a secret
i cant describe the feeling i get
you was riding shotgun i was wheeling the whip
shit i even let you rock out being bill belichick
tapin from the sidelines stealin my shit
but dawg you was like a mini me mocked me envied me
turns out you was blowin hot air kenny g
but you was cool accepted you instantly
not a groupie but you had a few tendencies
and though we share a few memories
couple wrong turnsll turn a friend to an enemy
see phony people like phony people
even you could be mistaken if you phone these people look
when you invite the nerds to the cool table
and you a little smarter than the average dude
so it took a nigga just a little longer to see
they tried to warn me fought with my girl erry night about you
shit only hurts cause she was right about you

she run around wanting to shoot you the fair one
i keep telling her chill i dont care none
i got another side i never showed to you
the side where everybody is disposable
see relationships are never a threat
cause ill erase the history and act like we never met
become done giving a fuck and done calling
i got your e mail i was done way before then

dear diary i dont wanna keep shit inside of me
id rather just speak to you privately
maybe its my mood as far as i can see
theres really no point in having this guy with me

change from the days of us getting in your truck
its bigger than one song its bigger than a buck
its bigger than me bigger than buck
bigger than voodoo its bigger than luck shit its bigger than us

i always call niggas fools for wanting to learn the hard way
when im really the fool for tryna teach em
when the blinds leading the blind you cant reach em
if niggas aint as hungry as you then why feed em
niggas aint tryna be lead then why lead em
having big problems with your dogs why breed em
ill keep my part up keep my guard up
was like thundercats but changed faster than cheetara

this a small part of a larger issue
sometimes acceptance is so hard to get to
but we all equal no one lower or above me
i love my team just as much as they love me
if not more
if i turn the knob we all going through the door i aint coming back for yall
the whole crew feel the same as me
how could you ignore something so plain to see
im being ignant that get on my nerves every minute
whats plain to some is really burberry printed

being so real sometimes is a slow kill
we was one squad you broke out like mike schofield
i want fillet mignon you want oatmeal
add up our differences equals up to no meal
no mills yup no deal why you gotta chase sht
to know its no thrills for real

a nigga still beefin with his baby momma
only thing my baby aint a baby no more
hit her on myspace maybe she aint shady no more
sent old girl a message no reply but she read it
some things are so embedded and our heads is
looking for os but get xs dealing wit ya exes
i was one long line away from the tetris
she sent me the l that sent me to hell

to the point where im denied my son
i dont see him dont talk to him i dont greet him dont walk wit him
but i pay for him like hes an object
no matter how right i am in court i cant object
dear diary how could she deny me
how she go to bed without it fucking with her psyche
is she wrong using him so i can come back
am i wrong for wishing i could get my cum back
looking for sun all i see is the hail
how im gon trust all i see is betrayal
its like they keep trying more and more to subdue me
and only you understand signed by yours truly


how many mcs must get dissed
how niggas still think they can still fuck with the kid
i guess i moved up in the world duke is not happy
take it as my success throwing shots at me
gotta calm the lions tame shooters
gotta catch a new body with the same ruger
we dont spit the same mucas
im a boss and you not shit they even tried to kill frank lucas
so nigga if i die tomorrow you aint gotta ask why tomorrow
dog i done con the likes of niggas
you should neva con with
made bonds with niggas you shouldnt bond with
im sick world in my palm shit re peated convict
while the dogs trying to con vick shit
i guess what im tryin say is niggas die running like ryan shay
all the lean me niggas got high hopes call them dream team niggas
shit is in my blood its a keen gene nigga
i make you appear to be whatever i feel like green screen niggas
so go and get suped off words maybe do it for jerz
maybe dudes disturbed  maybe dudes no go maybe dudes bezerked
so when i pull up in a tank maybe you deserve
i get into dudes character defects before your deal you was a character reject
humble pie when you see a character regress
fuck ya tape homie i pass it up eject
time to seperate the real from the lies
the hills have eyes but when the hill of ya demise
i reveal at the skies in a hot ferrari
its a new joe in town and its not girardi
look turn pink her face getting her cam on
in the club man on freak gettin her jam on
hands on trying to put her hands on the ice
cause its saw part four dog big enough to stand on
when did rappers start acting this fly
say you top five theyll grab it and ride but im humble
so even though i am legend i can say will smiths the best rapper alive
when they tell you your doing ya thing
they taking your tampon out and pulling the string


youre now hearin hip hop at its finest
im just criminal minded
the ed hardy with the fine fit
track just started no need to rewind it

me im bringin fresh air back im raps heimlich
got em all sick is that vomit
ew you nasty
man ill smack your skin if you feel you past it

its like we lions against lassies
niggas aint nice they lyin the flow ass cheek
im on the beat like contra pow
steamroll over shit im in a tonka now
this aint about radio see im beyond the dial
but still strong arm a nigga e honda style

the inserts of your album put my ganja out
that sweeter than the lip gloss on rihannas mouth
yall sleepin in pajamas on your mommas couch
im freakin in the bahamas throwin condoms out

hold up dog these felons aint predicates hands castle delicate
metal spit leave em on the field like everett
i does my own stunts like the jackie chan movie
mismatch belt prada but the pants louie
if you aint fair to me then your whole camp sushi
rockin iceberg when niggas didnt understand snoopy
damn moolies chain of commands ran through me
you and your man uzi slow down like brand nubie
cant do me grant to me like a man groupie
if thats the number one pick then he sam bowie
and i hate to blow a homie on your mans
you aint kid rock cant box the tommy with your hands
motherfucker

i was really in the lobby with the grands tryna take guap
in the hallway all day is or it aint hot
listen to hot nine like what do they got
that i dont with a blindfold i see everyone they says hot
its too easy im feelin like im a cheater
the flow heavy yours light like a slice of pita
when moms was pregnant she was lightin reefer
thats why im nice in the middle of alaska ill write a heater
im just cool and rough hoody matchin my adidas
pants with the permanent wrinkles like i am ian eagle
i will make every last one of you guys believers
dudes is all lost thats my word im playin timers keeper

treat me like a big brother slash fifth tucker
let the cig snuff you you a kid fuck ya
cocked ak mayday listenin to dre day
cant call me dick in the mouth somethin like ray j
they like steve irwin up against the stringray
heat up like jean gray when somethin with the beans spray

uh take a sip of ej then a little puff or two
get some butt then kick out the slut yous a bugaboo
weak dressers in the ring im mr wonderful
paul orndorff man yall all soft and huggable
yall dealin with a pro here that dont care
yall stiff and worn out like a closet with old gear
and i aint goin nowhere
producers know im the best thing over those snares
but you speakers whack ortiz i overdose like the needles packed
i bes in a zone then i give the speakers back

hold up joell the ethers back
see im raps larry johnson redid my contract now the chief is back
so blame it on fatigue
have you like greg oden injured before your first game in the league
im spendin old faces niggas took my style
gotta steal my own shit back like oj did
might size you and your spouse have guys go in your house
with ridges on the nose of the rifle like alf
pow


when im alone in my room sometimes i stare at the wall
with the phone off now ill withdrawal
gotta paranoia problem so im known ta keep a trigger roun yall
big told me theyd be prayin for a nigga downfall
im vacationin on a beach wit no sand
trynna check the time on a clock wit no hands
feel like im gettin close but im nowhere near it
i touch it but dont feel listen but dont hear it
starin out a project window under mad stresses
me and my mental got two different addresses
ones national trump international rational  
one is still stuck on the avenue
if you dont understand fine
my bodys playin heinz wit the mind
trynna escape a landmine
revamped designs i search but cant find
recant times when the future was a tan line
damn shit was much brighter then
now its just vitamins mixed in with vicodin
if they gonna setchu up to lose why try ta win
cause a scar dont stop nuttin on a vikins skin
so niggas can come after me  
even intelligent hoodlums  become tragedies
i move in silence   the jadakiss of jers
so when it comes to benjamins i dont say a word ya heard

see i can can crawl into cufflinks
step out tear down a party in the club scene
but i think its obscene
the lifestyles of the rich and shameless
id pick anonymity over being famous
from the start even if they dont see it i play a part
rather than sell a record rather do it from the heart
id rather put me before yall
i know niggas might call it selfcentered  
i call that bein smart
so i stand behind mics
not even worried bout the lime light
thatll manifest when the times right
if i was kanye i wouldnt have these problems
but then id have kanyes problems
blessed wit aything they ever fronted on a planet
but lose the only thing i ever wanted on the planet
back on the canvas just lost my bandwidth
granted imma always counter grant it
i been where you trynna go the god said it
so iggin mes not strongminded its hardheaded
thought i was on the right route tacklin the game
till they handcuffed my mouth put the shackles on my brain
popular stranger gone but still here
handicap my career ill put it in a wheelchair
lets keep the deal fair nuttin but real here
amazed after all these years i still care its weird


they say hip hop is dead or on life support
maybe not that could be something i just thought
i just ought to jump in fighting the sport
how you expect to be heard when your mic is off
i would love to go and browse through the robb report
but aint a car in that motherfucker i can afford
see niggas trying to block the road
rather then my label drop the growth they should drop us both
see i could scream def jam and what they used to be
but that aint for me to say thats for you to see
if not method man or redman ghostface young gunz
need i say freeway the proof is me
still dont believe me then wheres peedi peedi
they aint really giving a fuck unless you jeezy
thats what my mind say
just know if you aint the president or kanye you wont see the time of day

im so thankful that
come around these parts
we dont crank or snap we aim and clap
used to try to take the average rap fan show em shit
but if they close minded who am i to open it
rather spend time with a bougie broad
mean an actress bad bitch movie star
shallow bitches only into jewelry cars
still fuck with us though that aint who we are
soon as my wife gone they jump on the python
they aint know im out to hit and run like saigon
putting back the ice on had it screwed up
finally figured out that hate is the new love
but i dont see how you get ahead that way
when you team up with envy like red cafe
and all that blame is yours
you trying to get a chain like floss
im trying to get a chain like stores
find me in jers line for squeeze work off safety
cant keep calm around these jerks think beyond these words
treat the hood like myspace either become friends with the tommy first
so get found on the back of an empty carton
spray semi larkins for the bread like remy martin
dont mind me last of a dying breed
wanna take rap and bring it back to the ninetys
juicy inspired me cream made me angry
the mediall say anything to get at you
niggas is transparent im lookin right past you
henny is a bad dude talkin bout he act rude
so my new tattoo is god with a gavel
told baby girl if you wanna seduce me
just know my brain works like a bonaduce
my girlfriend say i use my charm too loosely
i tell her im too fly to have to con for coochie
hella paper tell a hater crib got a elevator
on the waterfront so yeah i oughta front
still times i feel like carryin chrome
or cheatin the system like im marion jones
tryin to sing for the moment cant find the note
put the game in a choke hold cant find his throat
hang with the big dogs cant find the rope
they tell me its alive i cant find the pulse so my


now look im in that five point zero feelin like chuck liddell
aside from rampage jackson its fuck the world
my lean came so mean so fresh and so clean
like a sunday morning listenin to joel osteen
like my beat down low im rimmed up with the seat back
boo with the sweet back i definitely need that
even if her body make a nigga want eat that
bitch you dont make a nigga better better see fab
i know a bird named amy love to tea bag
set you up right for some loosies and a weed bag
alcoholic cute face but her weave bad
and she went to the winehouse straight from the rehab
the recap rappers and they g stacks
fixated on imaginary ice like freeze tag
i speed past ease past with my g swag
im at a level most niggas couldnt see past

whoa whoa some say skys the limit still im tryin to reach higher
so on my deathbed im figurin how to be fly
im talkin above heaven
but talkin about death is me beatin a dead horse and a nigga love slevin
im a eightys baby with a sixtys mind state yankee fitted backwards
lookin at whippersnappers
livin young and reckless never mind who the best is
they need to get rid of their style put it on craigslist
cause you aint crazy stop it
even if you was wild like randy moss start feelin patriotic
how im gon lose with tom brady in the pocket
beggin dude to come back like the yankees did the rocket
and just like clemens did
reappear to get the most wins it in damn dickheads is so sensitive
pussies get hemorrhages find a way to benefit
even when it seem the whole world is against the kid

its bedtime niggas weapon of mine niggas wesson or nine niggas
minority report im ahead of your mind niggas
you wanted to beef you got twenty with you i got a hundred with me
now this is somethin to see
boogieman your whole squad put you under some sheets
in that dodge richard reid had under the sheet


even though they hate em  even though when a nigga try to make a come up
 its another nigga waitin just to run up
though they sellin rocks for shorts
and every night around twelve you hear them shots go off
and know niggas is rats some boys is wired
and the food in the supermarkets all expired
every blocks a liquor store an abandoned building
drunk parents at the liquor store abandonin children
though the sky seems gray well get through the weather
and even though they fill our grade schools with metal detectors
some cops is crooked and police indecent
and you can catch a body up the street from the precinct
though we got a lot of shit wrong a lot of shit goin on
gotta love it this the place i was born so i sit here dedicatin this song
this is still my hood

you know they got them macs out until ya times up
and the barbersll fuck ya line up
hold up cause even though
you cant meet a girl aint fucked a nigga you know

they look at you like you young and you black
get the fuck out of dodge
get a gun get some crack feel like thats our only op
tell ourselves well fall back as soon as that money stop
they feast on ya watch
and dudes stand on the corner like if life passes us by at least we
wanna watch
clowns get extorted  gangstas get recorded
mami dont know if she should keep it or abort it
cops youll never will catch me im aware all my warrants
and im not goin down  naw thats not goin down
carjackings shootouts is imperial here
and i dare you find a ratchet with the serial yeah
though you might have to raise ya gun just to raise ya sums

dont take it personal its just the paper they after
so i keep mine on me just in case i might have to
and still no other place that id rather
gotta love my hood

systems fucked up the jails is overcrowded
murder rates is up and as a matter of fact
a couple of close friends of mine have added to that
and i rate nothin above it i know it seems odd but i hate it and i love it
naw i hate that i love it
the same things that seem to get me always pissed
as soon as i leave i always miss its always like this
so small everybody knows everybody
its body after body its robbery after robbery


yo yo please lord somethin gotta give
they say for every negative theres a positive
but i aint positive for every buck deposited
we still in the hood livin like hostages and never mind colleges
school of hard knocks scholarship dealin with politics
i would just sell success in the store if i could bottle it
but i aint a millionaire wont see me in forbes son
life is like a  when you can afford one
ruger loaded just in case the war come
might as well everything is comin to the forefront
need a clear head just to think
and fuck a  nigga im two steps from a drink
the pressure either bust pipes or it make diamonds
no matter how high up the mountain i stay climbin
freedom i keep chancin
so if i fall like beyonce i just get back up and keep dancin


uh let me talk to em real quick la look look

the past is the past  im presently thinkin about the future
certain niggas bettin i fall
im speed joggin through the quicksand im jugglin three medicine balls

long way to go i see my feet gettin blisters
i dare em talk to me like mike richards
or play don imus and think its cool to disrespect our sisters
i guess we got a while fore they actually get the picture

im here to take the scoring title without the green light from my coach
man dont make me have to smack your lineup
im michael jordan yall harold minors that rap vagina
all black ski mask gloves tuck the thing
drive slow lights out like i love this game
i live this yall paint that pic
and like magic im starting to believe yall dudes aint that sick
might see ya boy scooping up a bird to get knowledge
number one draft pick and i skipped college
snakes in the trenches i peep those get injured
end up like grant hill on the bench in your street clothes
talk about he real how he quick with a glock
but like kurt thomas he aint good for shit on the block
see the gleam from the shoes
man i dont mean to seem rude
gunshots do you like vancouver make your team move

cant treat me like a sucka
gather up your five man meet me at the rucker
put the heat to you fuckers
half man half amazing with a clip in my boot
my four point five will make you skip to my lou think about it
understand when i was younger i was all on my own
so when i said three point two i wasnt calling a zone
nice truck nice house and chain
i car jacked you like shaq shooting a three man get outta your range
this is regular hood shit
i put don cheaney under the arm and show him how to make a good nick
if you wack you need to probably write
either that or quit it throw in the chair like you bobby knight
i work damn hard
but dont think i cant rob
cant pitch i still handle the rock like shammgod
still hurt you cowards
still see me merking them prowlers
and know they still call me dirk in dallas
im that nigga

man i kill lame queers
it still aint clear
never saving the tech like bill laimbeer
i got tools for rilly
with shells that make your temple hot and i aint talking bout a school in philly
i aint a selfish player
man i help your weight up
cuz only riders in this game now is myself and isaiah
listen you gettin dissed
while im screwing these misss
im on cruise control you still moving your pivot
but ill show you how mean this crook be
you and your dogs like the houston comets a team fulla pussys
creep
it aint a game no more its a sport
if you aint got heart to play then stay off the court

game over


i broke down a while ago finally picking up the pieces
memoirs on how the undefeated can feel depleted
i dont talk to god as a matter of fact i plead with
at times i hate my reflection and others im conceited
half the time im arrogant other times im vengeful
at times its to convince me at times its to convince you
done a lot of wrong but i aint never felt resentful
its been so many times i lost track of who to repent to
half the time im in the cut dont want you to notice me
grow with me and youll see that im only awkward socially
half the time im spiteful double barrel rifle
i owe so many payback i feel like i got a right to
so if you need a case in point you can refer to budden
and itll prove the painkillers never murdered nothin
all it did was make me succumb put ice in me make me numb
when i revisit the places it takes me from im sprung

listen up as a sinner reports my inner thoughts like an inner war
headaches act as a tremblin force on my mental ward
mentals distraught every word from this sinister boss
is brought to you by the people like your ministers porsche
tight ropin on dental floss before the haters begin to get lost
coke and weed got my temperament off
but why would my temper get lost when as soon as the temperature frost
im probably havin intercourse in a resort
criminal report pricey condos at a minimal cost
my train of thought aint as simple as yours
so if our paths happen to incidentally cross
i pray that you can overlook all my miniature flaws
until then lets let the bass kick
take a shot straight i dont see a need to chase it
tryin to fight the urge til theres somethin to replace it
i welcome yall to be my co pilots on this spaceship

yo me and the gang would get so blunted
wed order take out from the chinese stores
say make sure you bring change for a hundred rob him safety on the metals off
figured if we beat the brakes off him
then how the fuck was he gonna pedal off
some live and die by the high i was born by it
since pop gave my mom the needle like go on try it
got me feeling like aint a nigga could harm me
so i go and scoop a mami that wanna come join the army
she was so militant disciplined diligent
so i whispered to her bet you wouldnt mind chillin and
i got to know her on my sofa
i gave her my honorable discharge and she took it like a soldier
see she the type you gotta watch when she come around
really she only get high so she can come down
lost her when i said she aint gotta settle
once you start ahead in life youll be on the same level i bet you

when i was five this what my father said
i should have pulled you out and left you on your mamas water bed
you ask me my papas dead
alcoholic genes from him since a toddler bottle fed
put me in your stainless im brainless im a hollow head
 surprised im even walkin
can you blame me if im  but i aint stephen hawkins
i know god is in my  i can see him often
in the face of an innocent baby but not when preachers talkin


now if it goes to the wire
i will never fall i got the soul of a fighter
walk barefoot over the coal through the fire
i thought the toll would be lighter but make sure that blunts rolled a little tighter
i tell em im just lookin for some peace of mind
but they say im only working with a piece of mine
if ima do itll be of my own accord no crush
swear to god i never called upon the lord so much
play the corner of the club laughin at the wannabes
its ironic cause they erything i wanna be
would light a ton of reef
but thats gon unleash everything im tryna hide underneath
uh then id lose all ive earned
uh and if theres two things that ive learned
is im the only thing at stake
and when you the only thing real really you the only thing fake
uh must be time to escape from that
and fuck rhymes might be time to escape from rap
why should i be the only nigga to escape from the act
so i lie since everybody just escape from fact
yo that sucker shit niggas be on i cant dig it
joe wont lose even if you plan to rig it
yeah nuttin to prove with no fear of how im depicted
im here wont move i dont care to be evicted
you dont like how i move
well i aint gon keep still any nigga want me killed
wanna leave me in the streets peeled
well if it happens it happens i believe in free will
just know that aint how we built
ill call niggas that will dead you for a cheap thrill
when the clips empty they gon try and refill
and ima be the dude to try stop em like please chill
yall know what im about
they keep puttin up roadblocks i keep findin alternate routes
now success seems likely everybody wanna try me
im all for it cant trip me up wont fall for it
im just a man without a care
neighbor to heartache roommate with despair
reminded my past is darker
cause when am died  i was starin at travis barker
wishin there was something i could say to make him cheer up
and so i prayed and he teared up
i aint wanna see him go through that
the same shit that i feel i just never show you that
guess its none of nobody business
and it just makes you look weaker every joke is just smoke
gotta look deeper never mind dont bother
cause some of yall are smart enough and got sense
that if you try harder youll get a glimpse of everything
that i harbor we all aint got the strength to be a martyr
so to anyone who ever loved me
i apologize and im sorry
whole heartedly cant change
its just part of me its not music shits art to me
too fucked up to drive heres the car key
i dont care where we go just get it far from me
choices i dont wanna make but i know i have to
worlds goin faster since my ride or die chose the latter
lookin for a rush out of habit
proof theres a such thing as too much for a addict
aint the nigga im belittled as riddled ass
nigga come from middle class when you speak to me show a little class
dropped out of school cause a nigga couldnt sit through class
learnt to fall asleep through the sound of a pistols blast
i come from where dad taught mom to get high
but she strong so we still got by
when i picked up the drug why the fuck was they surprised
if it wasnt for your genes i wouldnt lust the supply
i come from a whole hood tellin me that im next
handin me a mag mustve noticed i was complex
they say that you a wild individual
you just not gettin my style you too typical
erybody got a word for me
shit yall deem important aint pertinent to me nigga
put your opinion with a feather and balance that
grab medicine when the success and the talent match


check it
no regrets nigga no regards
i know the bar raise mine yall can lower yalls
what i lack in talent i normally show in heart
prolly why they want the encore before the show can start
so if you in my life know ya part
thats the best way for us to never grow apart
even through the mid life crisis yall know who the nicest is
always tell it like it is in spite of it
dudes frontin quite a bit know ive grown tired of it
sometimes youd rather just watch the movie than write the script
authentic called cynic raw scented
more vintage yall mimic all gimmick
i ridicule whats been done
see i aint fooled by whats spewed bout they income
lose some you win some
perception shitll give you grey hairs and then some
inception are you living a dream or livin in one
haters see me get to thinking that it cant be all good
so i just kill them with the car brandy norwood
and keep chasin success that yall scared of
done carryin dead weight im no longer the pallbearer
check im too grown for all the games i dont play with suckers
im on the sideline just watchin the dave  busters
but when you think of joe this is unrefutable
the painters fucked up but the picture gon be beautiful

what throne are you an heir to
how can i be compared to nigga you fallin off with a parachute
your stack short got some earnin to do
youre new school just means you got some learnin to do
i dont care to argue  you to easy to tear apart through
what i hear is partial that whole project is sarah marshall
and i dont know what type of shit you on
i tried to make you get the point but you was chris duhon
so wheres ray felton when you need im
when niggas show you who they really are you should believe em
catch me with the top down turnpike speedin
bout to have jersey on fire like cleveland
with my back in the wall i aint never got slayed shit
lebron was king until that pressure got wadeweighed
so if you marry the game ill be at the alter waitin
with some niggas i dont call till its an altercation
less bail money less court cases
more mile high more vacation
more of my back rubbed more of my feet massaged
had me thinkin she invented face time steve jobs
they cant stay afloat they prolly need a mention
we in two different boats but yours need an engine
nerve of you niggas i earth you niggas
took the meringue out of shorty birth you niggas
dog i hear everything you say
you steve irwin to a upset stingray
a lighter to a upset jean grey
now whos hotta you notta
true scholar new prada a few dollars
niggas want to hit em with the chrome like blaka
im waiting for them when they get home like posada
how did he compare a stove to hells kitchen
that just make a man real mad mel gibson
so death to all the bullshit by any means
kill em all hang em from the ceilin using skinny jeans
for aspiring rappers that want to pop a can
for the families of sean bell oscar grant
nigga ya heat wave is almost up
playing for keepsake you almost fucked
so when you talk about joe
when you done being critical
say the painter was wild
but he made sure the portrait was original


something mustve changed me niggas might defame me
but things that used to taint me no longer seem to restrain me
strangely im no longer sad mad or angry
shame ably it pains me feeling like it just aint me
mainly what do i tell all the people that thank me
namely those who ordain me aside from can you blame me
motivation the game was supplying me its no longer providing me
jason williams something killed whatever was driving me
worrying less about the past more about the now
less about what im going through more about the how
its for certain spent thirty years being fit for hurdling
now im a different person with nothin to overcome and i miss the burden
for certain got six figures in my sock drawer
and honestly this year i expect to make a lot more
its hard to live without a budget when life is corrupted
in a house thats so peaceful that im trying to disrupt it
scream fuck it not because i have to but because i love it
which makes me as fake as the puppets that i speak of disgusted
without a paddle up shits creek
dig deep and see it aint life its just me
so be warned as im putting on like im reformed
only so yall can accept it as being my norm
maybe i quit working on me maybe i given up
maybe i been lying to myself maybe i give a fuck

i say it loud hoping someone can hear me clearly
trying to make my girl get it she dont know that its very scary
but shes a nympho she can be barely near me
she still want the god in her think she mary mary
the prettiest bitches just want to service me
while niggas prettiest bitches wouldnt get a word from me
some of you havent heard from me some of you wouldnt mind murking me
find that news funny likes its straight from ron burgundy
these niggas aint never seen dough
they can dream though i bump into em in between shows
people say im emo what that really mean though
is though the song cant breathe i actually make it seem so
i lost loved ones because they couldnt deal with me
cherish whoever still with me though the merits been killed in me
normally its just me and my lonely mind
everyone storm is different so this forecast is only mine
fans recognize my misery uplifted me
shifted me to my epitome guess the curse is a gift to me
maybe its serendipity maybe its weighing on me physically
maybe i should man up and tell god not to solicit me
been medicated meditated sedated hated
character assassinated all theses years i masqueraded
hard headed if it was on my mind i had to say it
tongue on the devils pitchfork to see how disaster tasted
rap is fabricated rappers are so exaggerated
wouldnt be scared of the truth if they werent castrated
grab a mag spray it surrounded by people that shoot it before me
thatll unconditionally love my beautiful ugly
now lemme speak to who i cater to
would you love me the same if all my weeks were not favorable
promised to maintain being unique but relate able
all while suffering from a disease that can do away with you


come along c come come along
but i dont trust niggas so make sure you come alone
i hand picked you you think sensibly
they friends with you dont need em to be friends with me
come along im a take you to some spots that you might like
but bring shades you gonna need em for the bright lights
grab a drink invite dykes that like vics
we always end up fightin cause thats my vice
and youll see how it feels when you sittin on the throne
when you so much better but they act like it aint known
so if somebody else is on it its a temporarily loan
hard to compete when there aint no competition
if everybodys the best why i feel like comp is missin
forced to find inspiration when i never had to
so i go against myself its a better battle
now come along c come come along
turned up the volume on her favorite song
we got so much in common
except when it comes to rhymin
she feel like lyrics are so intrusive
but i feel about her the way she feels about music
shes cute
she dont like the words she just like the beat and im thinkin me too

check it come along c come come along
and watch these niggas thats doin it all wrong
throwback swag nigga still doin rims
still doin throwbacks you still doin timbs
lookin for a way to save you aint earnin no cake
moved back in with moms she wont turn you away
then you all on the blogs showin off a cl
when its followed by the k gotta know its a mistake
benefit of the doubt homie if that aint your daughters car
i suggest you stop rappin about a audemars
cause in return im a just call a fraud
every time i hear a bar about the baller you are
now listen come along c come come along
she gonna probably drop her drawers if she step into my home
she gonna probably be on cock
its big enough to get lost in without jack or john locke
on the water like an island thinkin she on the dock
so she puttin in work im thinkin she on the clock
uh slow down baby girl what you tryin to prove
when you live like me its funny what one night can do

is you niggas out your mind
is it hard to recognize when you out your prime
maybe they cant imagine livin life without that shine
walk around hollywood like you so in demand
but when the labels stop backin nigga so do the fans
nigga you aint a superstar no allure about you
and when you talk about me it says more about you
wonder why when i aint around niggas change they tone
thats the way it looks
do they really think whatever they say behind my backll manage to stay put
we know the same people go the same places
from the same hood can only be so evasive
when youre from where im from youre gonna probably need the chrome
it aint just me its like that where we all from
thought some of them niggas just do it out of boredom
some just preppin for the day they see a war come
hangin in the wrong place if you never saw one
i dont know who you done dealt with in the past
better be self sufficient ma you dont get a pass
cause your thighs a little thick and you got a little ass
you lookin for a sugar daddy then go for it
twenty somethin years old with nothin to show for it
talkin about she was raised different
well get your own pockets bitch  so was i
now really come along c come come along
similar to scriptures similar to pictures
you can stick to rap what we doins much bigger


check
its time to educate a lurcher if youre featherweight by nurture
looking for a fix im here to medicate and nurse ya
was putting this shit off and know i hesitated further
even me thinking bout it is premeditated murder
so if when i levitate it disturbs ya
you brothers   i tried to see shit in all shades
so im prepped when they finally show they true colors
aint gotta worry about who im trying to appeal to
if all i do is keep it in fiveth what up philip hughes
public enemy im just missing terminator x
now who am i gonna terminate next
hearing all sorts of fables probly
who if you choose to believe will have you thinking im unstable
contrary to belief i weighed all i brought to the table
and decided that relationship wasnt worth being faithful
words from the wise when you lie make sure the trail is gone
and dont expect a happy ending less you in a nail salon
a matter of time before the jerksll start
it makes sense im being framed im a work of art
but if you broke dog
dont blame the economy
dont come with a handout
dont try to e honda me
see i never ask niggas to come and be fond of me
you met your match now what up eharmony


been in this game eight years aint fell off no bragging
its just been a lot of john doe and toe taggin
the jeans taverniti footwear is old fashioned
barkleys jordans maybe do some bo jacksons
all im hearing is coke rapping with no passion
from dudes getting fucked like something chris stokes imagined
black benz fuck an r class no wagon
way im on that turn pike you will think the pope passing
if you got an assessment of what i represent
its more then likely negligent if we was never friends
popping shit online havent even met me
yous a pussy and a bush kardashian and reggie
hello expectations i should look familiar
every time we meet you tell me aint nobody realer
whatever you expect from me i always go beyond that
and you be looking shocked as if you thought we lost contact
so if you knew me you would get why my manners are drastic
strong minded a lot of people cant handle that tactic
to keep it real politics always hamper the masses
and i rebel cause all i wanna do is hand them a classic
boo body gotta be right just to lamp on the mattress
till my accountant pull the trigger ill hamper they asses
im into fine linen ma lay a hand on my fabric
bad bitches fast cars no danica patrick
audience is die hard so if my fans spazzin
you might see the first drive by from a bandwagon
im not a role model i never claim to be   the
world would be fucked up   if
yall was the same as me   im
not to be copied off of
not to be emulated
this music aint the club more
so to be stimulated
a nigga far from perfect when you hear my pencil state it
that i would try to be yours
that i would demonstrate it
the naysayers talking
it seems i been degraded
and tho i hear their words
none of em penetrated
so when its cold out   i
maker sure im insulated
a little food for thought
hope your mental can take it


check it when the night falls and the smoke clears
millions of miles away yet they so near
i remember memories so im never lead astray
when tomorrow comes i know its only due to yesterday
without a boundary  check my latitude
new attitude see im grateful for having gratitude
im not complacent  but got no regrets
few hating niggas wanna see me regress
deep breath life is too short for me to be stressed
interpret ice grilling as their way of saying hes blessed
you wanna hate i got my own show be my guest
remember doctors used to tell me i was depressed
at the time was dating a model with double d chest
i thought til she laughed that shit off and said theses fs
before i bought my first gun was already armed
teach you about couth little bit of class heavy charm
used to give my last for a nice chain heavy charm
high school dropout but went to every prom
now everyone i went to high school with
now they thirty years plus still on some high school shit
seems like all the fly niggas and bitches that was well off
is junk head high niggas all the bitches fell off
from surgery rapping for niggas that never heard of me
burglaries dapping up niggas that want to murder me
if you close minded i call that an emergency
blind fold yourself as if theres nothing more to further see
honestly thats absurd to me
if the sky is the limit then wheres the urgency
i embrace life  im so carefree
but i wont judge yall if you dont care to be
just know no matter who you are
the right system  turn a role player to a superstar
im talking rock bottom a whole nother tier
stuck in the moment made me move through a whole nother year
howd i become straight forward
no baggage yall can run from the past im a make my way towards it
like  nigga i remember stage fright
back when i aint know if i could rock the stage right
who knew id end up being the nicest
my point hard to come up short when shit is priceless
hard to come up short when shit is priceless

i say this with all certainty people wanting the worst for me
got to wait in a long line its not a first for me
most of my defects have been put in my past
if you only see what i have then you overlooking my path
if you knew about my hardships and the bloodshed
itll speak for itself  and thats enough said
i carry heavy weight who wanna try and bear it
hope to lessen it daily if you wonder why i share it
being stuck in that moment never appealed to me
you aint live my life so you cant imagine how real it be
im talking about the long haul
put me on a high pedestal  better be prepared to watch a long fall
so the trampoline i adore
got so much to say to the people i ignore
dog some moments you rather forget because they scare you
i lock onto them shits like a pit they just prepare you
photographic memory of deja vu
the way i do whatever i say i do
nigga built ford tough show facades what talent is
get a different v you aint got to dodge challenges
emotional roller coaster vivian green
every event led to living a dream  or do i live in a dream
where theres no such thing as a crisis
my point cant come up short when shit is priceless


uh i got bitches on my dick i dont want em near
closet full of brand names i dont wanna wear
everybody got advice that i dont wanna hear
world in your palm but you dont wanna share
still im followin you   are you leadin me with a weapon drawn
co dependent on her but got me in bed alone
you say if you love it let it go nothin set in stone
plus every rock they throw i use as a stepping stone
got questions say the answers better left unknown
though i may not never see you i should know you never gone
you sayin follow my lead follow follow my lead
brought me to my knees he must wanna holla at me
when the world feel like swallowin me
when every decision costly and i aint got a dollar on me
check it i dont wanna pretend i dont wanna live a lie
i dont wanna be judged dont wanna be criticized
i dont wanna talk theres nothin i wanna say
the more i let em get to know me the more they just run away
and that must be your way of sayin we should stay together
i know how to fuck it up more than i can make it better
i figured folk around me would learn to take it better
instead of tryin change me ive been this way forever
time will reveal more will be shown
you pushed it i thought the door closed on its own
but uh nevermind what caused it
livin a dream nothin in this world powerful enough to pause it sing

hes sayin follow my lead follow follow my lead
cig in my mouth prescription bottle by me
and even when i think you might be makin a mistake
i may not know the destination but i make it there safe
check it when i feel like i cant get weaker uh
you always come and make a cameo or feature
im good with my insanity and fevers
cause pacs lookin from heaven sayin they aint understand me neither
a lot of times you leave me exposed
and laugh at me still thinkin i could be in control
help me weather the storm altogether i aint know him
cause i always disagree though you aint never been wrong
listen i was feelin nearly unstoppable
and now im facin what appeared to be impossible
feelin unimportant enough to have to bother you
but im down here alone nigga all i got is you

check it  i cant fit it all in a sixteen
the night that i was tipsy and all them bullets just missed me
the day they rushed the block i was strapped but they didnt frisk me
why i aint fuck that stripper dont ask and now shes sick b
the drop on that jewelry store for fifty
and i backed out last minute like nah this shit look risky
one of my mans dead the other one in poughkeepsie
another one in the feds hell be there until hes sixty
i want to thank you for the blessings and the gifts
and the lessons and the messages they left i get the drift
fuck the cheddar or whatever it dont measure up to this
i mean never did i ever not remember you exist
when i hop up out my bed hands together and i wish
swear to you its from the heart inside my chest you let it tick
i love you from the soul with every spiritual molecule
fuck twitter all a nigga gotta do is follow you


joey talk to em
hoping my true motherfucker know this be the realest shit i ever wrote
its its that on top muzik
i be at the mall walk up in the store
glance up at the wall pick out a few kicks
i need elevens in these
matter of fact while you at it bring em in a size six
i take shortys shoes off
like here try on these js make sure them shits fit
but in my head it gets thick sayin
joey fall back cause thats not your kid
i dont know you lil nigga and plus i got a son of my own
but hes at home and the ways hes being raised i dont really condone
naw cause his pops been gone fuck it
ill explain it to him later when hes grown
old enough to have a phone
askin why mommy hate me
and he got the sneak to call me whenever hes alone so
you wouldnt know it but i got a soft spot for you
see we would shared the same obstacles
looking from the outside may seem like you neglect him
but when he slips up and calls me dad i correct him
i protect him when baby girl start ventin about you i say respect him
and though it seems out of order
my own mistakes have turned me into your biggest supporter
fast forward you wouldnt believe
how i could love like mine what i didnt conceive
tryin to help him reach shit what i never achieved
am i doin it for him or is it my own greed cause see
me and my baby moms we dont do the conversations
son cramped in the back two bedroom shack
with seven people livin there just congregatin
so when your child with me im over compensatin
im talkin eight bedrooms seven baths
my son thinkin thats the shit that only heaven has
mines gotta keep it cool yours get to see the view
white marble around the ground heated pool
mines got to go to the y
shit yours just got to walk outside
and the irony of it all and its just sad
is you walked away yet im the step dad
and then you get on skype sayin how you being whats the word
and i be on the background listenin like
this motherfucker here got some nerve
he says bye daddy i love you
i be wantin to snuff you but wouldnt want him thinkin less of you
but hes perceptive and this shits wild
he picks up on everything and hes just a child
so through all my resistance
im afraid this two year old can already see the difference
he sees you dont provide when youre capable
why we never fix things while were still able too
so youre annoyed it kinda of hampers me
get my boy i always wanted a family
just to greet when i get to the door
you gon have to take the l i cant give you yours
ill do all the work you aint gotta be bothered
you can be his dad ill be his father
i relate though so i know it hurts


yeah yeah
these niggas losing their minds you find that theres no reward
they say they already home its really clear they abroad
they sound like they boxed in its not just where they record
theres a cost to be a boss they cant clearly afford
swear to the lord theres guns like a audience
you put on a show my forty clearly applauds
sitting fifth row i might appear to be bored
plotting on a kanye but screaming wheres my award
balling out of control never won an espy
bout to buy a black ghost and name that shit sp
flow outta this world im coming for my moon man
you niggas slide back like that walking on the moon dance
no glitter glean handgun with a beam
have some boys follow you street fam twitter team
like you could fuck with me oh did it seem
dr king and def jam aint the only ones with a dream
im a grown ass man this kid a teen
youre a spoof of me like if hip hop did a scream
audi coupe looking good so i went and copped it
got that tt popping like a trending topic
my rides matte black my pride is that jacked
it might get ya dog shot even a cat smacked
anyway though styles dont apply to me
jeff goldblum couldnt be more fly than me
shorty say right after the suck fuck poof
you hit it on the head girl duck duck goose
you shoulda got the message that i chuck up deuce
reporting live from the beacon booth tired from the beating
had foreplay all day prepping the beat and the mic for a threesome
with my vocal bi coastal speeding til the rides totaled
mr wi fi out a franchise go to magic standby locals
watch the track bust once i show my dick size to the pro tools
i teach you how to have models screaming get behind me
e pills and maybachs aint gon matter if your tip is tiny
never mind me we could get knee deep in the beef
seek me with the heat but youll need more to keep me on a leash
heres a cc for the peeps that wanna see me in the streets
invest in rockports and be easy on your feet
give a few hammers a few semis and a few snubs
to a few crips couple vampires and true bloods
gambling in casinos have a honey handing me my c notes
the modern day gambino im careful every step i take
you the nigga walk up in a shootout with some pepper spray
thatd be the last mistake you ever made
me i chop his head off from a rooftop
and race it downstairs just to see if i can catch his fade
like groceries when im shooting at fags
make sure the breads separated and put the fruits in a bag
withstand the hatred dudes is fallin off doin all they can to save it
but everybodys run stops ask brandon jacobs
what yall call swag to me is all faggotry
fours want blast at me thatd equal more casualties
abort the strategy or get attacked with that duracell
they put in your back now thats assault and battery
you can keep the bitching to yourself
theres beams on every burner these lasers a petition wouldnt help
what good is having shooters if they the type that miss
where im from better be careful where you drive that whip
niggas put they life at risk for pies they flip
in my town ben affleck wouldnt try that shit
and if he did hed get turned around burnt down
tell the new jacks itll be a while fore they eligible to earn the crown

acid out the baggie this is more than dope flawless flow
fucking off a sign every horoscope done wore my robes
strapping up the corner cold critical
unquestioned my opponents know
i shoot like kapono watch me own the show
comatose toasted getting money while i roam the coast
stones and boats mansion homes and hoes
i deserve em both overdose
time to earn my votes watch me turn the volts
voltage through a meter this electric chair danger
yeah i see ya now make way fore it turn to diarrhea
hear a microphone will give you three of everything i wear yeah
models by the pair swear bottles private lear steer
style thats outta here rare thousands by the chair square
sleep with me you came here war with me is scary
get beat silly trying to lamp here better bring your fury heat
i got a drop damp here niggas try me barely
no one breathes i need an ants ear pressures necessary
got my mind on the cheddar kill my haters together
bury em in abundance and starve their families stomachs
paper come in my thumbage brand new fifties and hundreds
on point just like the drum is im warning them baby mothers
got the hunger of a broke rapper

bentley off the scene magnum mo splasher four packer
southside nigga spitting coke at ya

we beef like being deep and dumping ks
you beef like lady gaga and her stylist
yall get together to look good in front of a bunch of gays
my feng shui is a pump in the desert
youll come up shorter than an asian jumping out of a trunk in the desert
while my wolfpack looks for strippers and cocaine
niggas snitching its a shame we call em male tattlers
fiends touching they noses more than url battlers
its hard to spit saliva when you spit fire so ill just
pour sugar in your gas tank put a banana in your tailpipe
ah ha so the car can fit the driver


please lord have mercy jesus christ
hes just nice he just right   just tell my side of the story
look at the bullshit i been through
next generation of rap lets continue
might not understand now cause the picture is tainted
ima take the time out for yall to try to explain it
i was a kid in jerse no name no stage
listen close while i get everybody on the same page
me and dub made music  the times was hard
and we really couldnt pursue it cause we both had jobs
bryce said we could get straight cream
rap over other niggas beats and i aint know about the mixtape scene
so we did that goin off my godbrothers promise
i spit a hundred bars over nastradamus
and bryce knew cut so i had hope all along
next c tape was two freestyles and a song  lets go
he gave c said its the go i bet you
c said hes all right but whats so special
held onto it and it mustve been luck
because some nigga named webb went in the back of his truck
and found my shit listened and the rhythm was ill
said this kids all right and watch me get him a deal
on top met me and dubb and we liked him
gave us ten gs
started makin music loosely
but djs was hesitant to play em because nobody knew me
i guess joe budden was new
i needed some help so fab came through and we did coming for you
did another joint later on with tah murdah and black child
the streets finally started to react now
made some songs it was such a long process
stopped by to check progress
steady bangin clue who was still ignorin
cutmaster and envy were still supportin
then clue got with it cause my man called hype
tellin me im on the clue tapes spittin and lets get it 
people started to really see what was what now
your boy got a lil bit of buzz now
everything was so timely
cause game went up there and told kevin liles he wanted to sign me
so on top went to meet with leo and kev about business
they started talkin some spit shit
it was a new label we aint know all about
the rappers they wanted to sign but wasnt sure about
made it sound worth my while though it was weird for me
told me if i broke the label theyd take care of me
you put out  speed things up
but that shit aint keep things up i started noticin
that def jam treated spit as a knockoff
and jump offs better than that yall i got off
then im on def jam  waitin and chillin
left the mixtapes to get things straight in the buildin
left the streets dry i aint give em no ether
nitti and skane up there beggin for a feature
and they gave us one and we thought it was hittin
we thought threerd storee would sell but they didnt
and the politics had me hopeless
and the label just kept overlookin me  
travel from state to state
club banger no video spinnin  eight at eight
by the time def jam knew it bumped and had flavour
record died down this is eight months later 
and that whole time i was out of the street mix
so they tried to bring it back with a bullshit remix
and now they respectin a nigga
but im scared cause the soundscan is straight disrespectin a nigga
so its back to the mixtapes where i aint gotta deal with the nonsense
and the next two leaders
so at a time where the whole rap game is shaken
theres a slot wide open and its there for the takin


look i was such a lost soul just wanted to be down with something
look at your son now mommy i amounted to something
you couldnt figure out what i had messed with the streets for
cause you saw my genius without a sat score
i took drugs and laced it with things
but you a addict yourself
for you i was people places and things
angeldust use to have me in the hallways twurked
i tried to hide it but visine didnt always work
i needed someone to blame in my mind
i thought if you and dad never used dope i would a came out fine
and so i igged you hard when you threw in advice
like what i want to talk to you about you ruined my life
you the reason why i ended up a con and i knew it
the reason i filled my body with that bomin fluid mommy
you the reason that my lifes gone illegal
the reason im kinda different dont think like normal people not calm

listen aint shit like seeing your moms crying on the floor
knowing you the reason why she aint alright no more
but so young i was like whatever
you use to chase me through the house with the knife like get your life together
fucking drugs how could i ever amp on you
and what made me think that i could lay my hands on you
im not surprised that you mad at me
much as you hated my father your youngest son is just like his daddy
mommy i live life rude how could you not understand it
on the same note im just like you
i got moms sensitivity my fathers balls
his humor his g yet my heart is yours
fuck school cause i had my major
come to grips that it aint so much the drugs its the addict behavior
wasnt the dip jar its the cut that came with it
wasnt really the smoking but the rush that came with it

i felt so alone i had a crew but so what
then when angela stabbed me guess who showed up
and when people said id always be ill and twisted
and when the therapist had told us that the pills would fix it
was sick of being sick i was finally hurt
with all the praying that you did ma it finally worked
god gave you a son back i wont offend you again
wont let the disease turn me against you again
use to be high as ever  joey jr got his life together
as a result now we tighter than ever
so blessed so grateful to be seeing tomorrow
thats why i cant take a drink not if even a swallow
i cant picture me twisted like what im a do now
haters i cant stop yet my mothers to proud
secure now dont need to be down with nothing
look at your son now mommy i amounted to something
im so calm

calm down
thanks ma
i couldnt do it without you
you are appreciated
fa sho
its a slow process yall
one day at a time though to get beautiful


nobody thought id ever be dope with the pen
whole first album was real all wrote from within
got a little bit of fame im in the five top off
lokin again nah i aint smokin again
maybe i was too advanced or cause the masses
didnt go through it firsthand maybe they couldnt understand
the trials of a kid who never graduated
maybe theyd rather hear some bullshit thats fabricated
like my rims keep spinnin on the v on the ave
fuck me gettin shot at or me gettin stabbed
fuck gettin so high to the point that i was gettin so high
off of that high that i almost died
fuck everything ive seen in the precinct thats indecent
or the coppers tryna keep me in there for no reason
fuck being homeless rib cage showin
last night i had beef but had to go there to eat
fuck me growin up and not gettin to see dad
fuck therapy detoxes and rehabs
dudes in the hood being wild undercover
or me beefin with my childs mother
or fuck joe budden the third chill
cause if you fuck with joe budden the third then nigga thats my word
fuck the jealousy deceit
fuck the strong arm and bes  much older than twenty three
fuck what im rappin fuck this and the pad
and nigga fuck me missin my dad
maybe if i rap bout buyin the bar out or all the jewellery that i got
then maybe yall niggasll listen to that
but listen know now that this is my whole style
and i cant rap that other shit i dont know how
all the hate shit on me and the fakeness i see
i write the real and you cant take that from me

i dont write so my label can be on top
nigga i write so the voices in my head just stop
nigga i write my life and its way too real
this is pay per view not the dave chappelle
joey hated by many and loved by few
one of the last real niggas left what you wan do
trouble with my voice but even without a voice
still for every hood in new jersey im the choice


see the haters is still soupin and
yall aint happy to hear that im really couping it
haters im really doing it
you cant step to me im awkward i box lefty
nah better yet im ambidextrous i can do it with both
haters tried to put a stop to it i had to do it with toast
they dont like that i dont do it like most muhfucka
cant help the fact that i spit up acid
im from a different world
son im dwayne wayne without the flip up glasses dog
a lot of you herbs be phony
i never said im the illest but at this present time im jerseys only
trying desperately to wrap me up started to fight with the game
now what other rapper from my hoodll back me up
and now they mad in the streets but if i was wack itd peace
and i never asked to be part of raps elite
i was like yall struggling i lived in my moms crib
then i dropped a couple freestyles and the people responded
and now when you flip about the stations
djs holler lets take it to jersey
all you hear is uh salutations
im working hard on my grind im about to make it
see my cloud is raising why cant i manage without the hating
the sooner the greater if everything was peace
we could be a unit like flavor
look around you bout to ruin it hater
with a major still im working myself
and im right where i wanna be so you only hurting yourself
hoping i shelf im promoting myself
and the bottom line is that hating is just self centeredness just showing itself
wanna bust off to hit me cause all the twenties in the loft is crispy
and all the streets want is jumpoff and fifty
die traitor asking me why playa
when i breeze through all i do is look at you
hi hater
best friends become strangers you shady dunn
and i done gave you some guidance you chasing my baby moms
i used to feel im your man know what that feel like my man
how you look yourself in the mirror still feel like a man
joey
future greatest i aint twisted at all
and four albums down the line you can say you witnessed it all
just think you could say we had some business before
you could go as far as saying that we was niggas before
but its just me and my box of bogeys i cant flock with you clonies
god damn being on top its so lonely
sony say i sound like grafh
i was signed a good year and a half before he popped up
dont say im trying be something im not what
joe budden dogs im back in the circuit the block is shut
this fall is a hot season
def jam invited me here and im not leaving
just me and my box of bogeys got my glock as my homie


yoim seeing a couple things wrong with the way that im living
so come and walk with me i just need a second opinion
see to me its heavy but to you it may seem petty
lets continue walking i know you aint tired already
i take you to meet my girl i got to see if you notice
if she love me or if the bitch got an ulterior motive
why am i hated cause i handle my business
aint gotta look for a girl nowadays cause almost all these niggas is bitches
see em often while we walking ill show you the drug dealers
and some dudes that hate me word on the streets is they real killers dog
where was the hate back when i wasnt on my feet
an alcoholic school dropout just a bum on the street
where was the hate during my adolescence
back when that psychiatrist was trying hard to get me on them antidepressants
so man i dont recall none of this happenin back then
and i dont understand i was still rappin back then
so i got to ride with a gun
from trying to get my mom and pop up out of the slums and provide for my son
if you met my baby moms would you notice
if she was ready for a child of if her ass had an ulterior motive
i dont know what shes teaching trey but everday he get older
angies bitter and feel like now that im successful i owe her
cause she would hold me so tight when i was ready to relapse
tell me to relax i aint know no better straight out of rehab
bottom line i was lonesome
but we was wrong for each other angie i grown some
got bigger issues if you went to def jam would you notice
if they was out for my best interest or do they just see a dollar in joseph
guess i aint sure how i feel anymore
ever since i got signed i cant tell whats real anymore
i mean them same record execs that wanted me in
dont care that im the next nigga they just wanna see spins i swear
ever since i got signed i cant tell whats real anymore you feelin me dog


pump it up came out was a hit all over the country
and so i figured all over theyd want me
the buzz was there and the feeling was timely
and kev said that he would put the whole building behind me
the whole office daps me freely
and mr cohen always seems so happy to see me
im treated like a new man musta got a facelift
this what i dreamed of welcome to the matrix

only problem is my voice is goin out now
doc said i need a surgery to fix it
and if something goes wrong it could be permanently twist ted
now thats something i cant afford
so steroid shots in my ass just so i could record

now def jam wants ya boy on tour
this is important you cant back out
its good exposure and one point twos coming back out
im on their second single and theyre on mine
im bout to shine june tenth yup its time but wait
something must be wrong with the soundscan
thats when it all started to go down man

pumping it up with my face on screen
had to change my second single cuz theres two one point twosjoe buddens
but theirs turned into one point twoluda
lil jon called me for the get low remix
but lyor was goin through some tvt shit
then they went and kept joe off of the roc the mic tour
somebody probably thought joey would rock the mic more
left the country did a single with j lo
but with my luck i knew columbia would say no
radio hates fire nah they wont try it
but they love that rah digga song that sounds just like it
wanna keep me under dog im the underdog
and they dont want yall to see up under the fog so yall

this is what i dreamed of time to tackle the matrix


they say a
closed mouth dont get fed and an open one does
so its all about what you believe and not what niggas is eatin
if open mouths is open long enough niggas can see in
here you out of reach  clear you out of breathin
they love to hate me the cowardly brothers sleep on im
i make em starve and sally struthers can speak for em
nobody in the game can hold me im the same as kobe
dunk over your back you overmatched nigga shane mosley
if this is beef ill get chris and neef

and if you live bout battle ill razor ya face

you scared get a dog and if you broke get a job

its regular joe partner rap is so popular
swear we gotta be the highest rated soap opera
now a days it aint about whoever flow hotter
its about gimmick image and whoever gross dollars
while i try to be me just a man with issues
they even complained then some fans is so fickle
cause yall fall for it yall niggas believe em
gotta learn how to read em gotta learn how to weed em
if somebody promoting gangsta dudes reaching
cause gangsta and promoters are like two different regions
im so tired of beefing
shitll only end in another man leaking and another man bleeding
especially the rap beef i hate rap beef
half these cats aint real they only rap beef
half these cats should chill thats if you ask me
cause if you catch em with the mill then its a track meet
plus i feel like every beef is the same
now im caught in it beefing with game
and his image is the west coast savior must of been the only weapon in hand
i know pac is in heaven like damn
but thats a small problem real little in fact
fab chill wouldnt put you in the middle of that
i dont need a nigga help nah niggas is trash
five on one but it aint like one of them niggas can rap
and i got other shit to deal with like my little bro becoming a man
gotta watch what hes becoming hes fam
dont know if he at the age where theres a gun in his hand
cause hell be done in a can see hes young understand
little niggas too smart to end up in a building
but every nigga that i know thats in jail is brilliant
and they all got a story normally full of glory
a few misteps and a couple of regrets
they all tight in the mental with credentials after all the shit they been through
matter fact they all got potential
matter fact we all got potential some of us dont use it
so having it is useless
he dont wanna be a shoulda couldawoulda
but he didnt now he sent in bunkie asking how he get in
now he just it now he pissed in
he got loved ones but now we gotta visit em
yeah hes talented but now its all hindering
shit you would of gave to em now you gotta send it in
whatever you doing youngn dog it aint fine
without a breathalizer nigga walk a straight line
i gotta teach dude that friends aint friends
and love aint love no matter how heart shaped it is
you dont need friends the cars and cakell get
you need em when times are hard they adjascent with
that aint where you wanna be and shouldnt have ta
wasnt in the before flick shouldnt be in the after
only trying to fuck you like incest
while you search like credit cards for who got ya best interest
and i dont wanna talk ya ear off about a whole bunch of shit im still learning myself
play ya friends from far and keep your enemies close
cause i done been through enough for us both


lets go back to nine seven seventeen though i looked like twenty
and i was poor i didnt look like money
then i saw someone i thought who was mature looked like she would shun me
and inside its like my pride had been took right from me
she loves to dance dancin in the middle of the floor
so i thought i better get to her before
other guys start to notice she was fly had a brother goin wild
tryna leave the club with the future mother of my child
i cant believe it
nice ass and cleavage
shes twentythree shes somebody i can see me with
two weeks pass now im gettin wit her

only the strong survive if you physically weak
you get gunbutted stabbed shot and critically beat

fuck  yeah
cain
ask about me


yo at this present time theres a lot of nonsense at stake
too many ideas and decisions left to contemplate
too much to deal wit too much to make a nigga have to steal shit
and its hurtin cause i gotta feel it with too much anger
too many niggas know me but they dont know me
analayzed popular stranger and peep how niggas try to change ya
but i cant cope with no antidote two options one is slittin my wrists
go to the precinct with a clip my fist
so i keep a cig in my lips shit is painful fuck suicide
done did too much dirt to know if ima be angel
so help me god cry in my sleep
cause you aint pull me out of shark infested waters to die on the beach
and i was told dont trust cause they plot at the end
so treat friends as nobodies and nobody as friend
yo it just seems like troubles followin me lock and key
stuck in the belly of the beast and its swallowin me
with no cream with no bundle to hustle and no scheme
no niggas to run with and no team
tell me what its like to have ran out of options when you goin all out
or what its like to be in love and fall out
just want to put it behind me and breathe without the fuckin nine to squeeze
without the weed and hennessy to keep my mind at ease
without rollin over coilin myself tryin to sleep
without bein homeless and starvin and dyin to eat
shit wasnt like this at the youth house
throughout my teen years been forced to grow up too fast mofucka im not a youth now
wish i could let a lot of people see the true mouse
but im too scared to see him myself whatd be the use now

from houses to gas stations ive done robbed em all
facing ten to twenty thatll start a robbers fall
jacked whips in parking lots i got the drop from fords
and this amount of victims coming out a shopping mall
im a totally different nigga when im copping the raw
apartments with adt got through the locks in the door
i met some dollared out chicks somehow i got in the drawers
seen niggas die in cold blood they had got shot in the war
want a seed for the wrong reasons to see me different
in hopes of me guiding so hell never have to see a prison
but my shorty got it fucked up
or maybe i just got it fucked up
somebody got it fucked up
what a nigga got besides his music
thirsty as hell cant smoke the water cause i know that ill abuse it
and mafuckas cant afford to see that fuse lit
they cant afford to see a nigga on some new shit
and where my pops at nigga need him now
show up later on when im black and fuck im bleedin now
showin my moms another side she never seen in me
how the fuck she dont understand when its her genes in me
howd i progress in therapy while wantin to leave this world
and i know how to beat the system cant beat the world
i talk that take my own life to get off the scene quick
unfortunate that im too much of a genius to really mean shit


old soul through the fire and tears
a nigga seen too much a little wise beyond my years
but aint nothin changed or raped me
and fame aint made me  but the games tryna drive me crazy
oh three was kinda rough
two burners pulled out on me none of em bust
one dude both times and only one of em bust
nobody killed around almost like i got a shield around me
you haters wanna holler
im on the same corner as the muslims with the paper for a dollar
dont care what you doin you let your temper flare and start brewing
youll be sorry this year like rubin
got robbed once a nigga truck broken into
and i made some new friends is it all coincidental
a few dudes got them llamas waitin to hit you

now lets take the ghetto and go deep inside it hoodie always trying to keep shit quiet

they dont want america to see inside it they dont want america to see the riots
act a fool like when they blast a tool like when they robbing they mobbing
aint no option they be doing what they have to do
dudes is snitching and theres narcs on the strip so they must have got a new suspicion
dudes is tricking cash is low so on the weekends probably got their main boos stripping
steak outs i need a way out and when i make out trust it im a stay out
and id be caked out thats a safe route yall can kill each other all day now
cause im sick of all from the bodegas chinese joints and the liquor stores
like just get rid of it all they only exhibit for niggas to fall
but niggas is quick to ignore prohibit a niggas to saw
or gripping the pistols and fours and getting you niggas in court and filling the prisons with yall
these niggas is forgetting the system is  persistent on ditching the people

etcetera no the hood wont hold me down i stay one step ahead of ya
and if it comes down to it id die for this dudes loss they life over pettier

and theres always a nigga in debt and theres always a nigga to step
and theres always a nigga you met and theres always a nigga you let

and the whole hood is dipped up so having sanitys rare
im from where embalming fluid aint stop yet and city halls primary project
is knocking down the projects they aint finished that yet
see im from carjack central niggasll go in your ride
while you pick up the jersey journal damn so and so died
im from where the dope game is bad so every hustler cant hustle
tryna hustle them a rapper slash muscle them a rapper
they can find them a young nigga with a few bars to say
cause nigga raps the new coke wet weed and yay
im from where  had it locked til dude had him shot
for everybody to see and everybody was relieved
im from where the blocks is dark so walk the turf with ya gun cocked
and the hospitals will fuck you up worse than a gunshot
from where screws is loose gunpoint dudes strip nude
and that aint even half of new jeruve nigga

o oh o oh
stack bundles
riot squad

from the last stop on the a train where the youngin let his thang bang
we shoulda left the two
where the skies is gray cause no stars around
was the last star around
home  in the street
forty niggas  fortyonest side piece
where edgeman raw p and redford
so get your shit  theres no gettin it back
were from where bitch niggas go to jail and turn thug and
crip niggas go to jail and turn blood and
niggas come home flip a lil weed
end up with barbershops and music stores with cds
from where niggas on seventeenth was gettin it
and they own workers left them uncomfortably
from where they argue bout whose fuckin whose broad and whos drivin what cars
and niggas hatin like he got that from insurance
where old heads was gettin it but kept gettin robbed
so they wanted out the game and converted to god
where niggas play the corners til they pecks is done
and out of towners come to blam blam the cannons and run
from the other side where queens niggas dont come through much
the record execs wouldnt sign us said wed done too much
so they ran over to brooklyn and thought them dudes was to trust
i dont know what the fuck they thought them niggas look sound just like us
from where the streets get the best of you  the beefs inevitable
when you come through half price
from where the soldiers fall and thugs we are all
im from far rock son just thought id remind yall


now if he call you a five it aint to say hi
its to get you on ya back with ya legs high
he call you a ten like its nothin real major
he a smart dude he settin it up for later
if he spends time yall all over town hangin
the more shit he buy you the bigger the down payment
and if you get the house number on the spot
then you finer than every girl he already got
dont fall for the line get grown in ya head
its a lie if he hit you wit my phone was dead
or the old i was sleep them lines is so
yall always fall for the i aint have no signal
if he dont answer when you block ya number
he probably got a wife and he blocks you from her
condoms irritate him and he wanna try raw
chances are hes used that line before
now if she call you all day always leavin a message
then you pipe her better than whoever she mess with
if shes tight with erybody you know
then shes prolly a hoe and erybody know
up and coming model and she goin so hard
its just a nice way of sayin she got no job
if every time you call she turn off the ringer
then you probably turned her off and she rather use her finger
she makin excuses lately nigga
no kids but she gotta find a babysitter
these are lines made up from girly
she dont really wanna see you if she say she gotta wake up early
dont fall for the bs she try to feed ya
cause shell try to beat ya shell try to g ya
have you heated come back scorchin
but you know a girl period dont come that often
get back in the game
if she give you head she expects that in exchange
and if she got a seed nah dont even bother
cause if yall ever beef shell threaten you with the father
and shes a good trick she wont let you hit
she knows pussys power wanna see what she can get
and if you think that nuttin im sayin is right
then at least know to never make a hoe a housewife nah


if you feel like i feel its all love what up
now throw ya motherfuckin fingers in the air  yeah
mr on fact here to do it like on fact this aint about rap
if you aint come to feel good we gonna do it without you
too low turn the music louder yeah
turn the music loud in here
you understand that what yall about to hear
feelin myself homie what
see im a leader wont show me up
nah see they wont slow me down wont slow me up
skys the limit til i die and im in it
but thats not the case tonight
pop a case tonight
like whatever you want do its okay tonight
see cause all of that salt we gon shake tonight
i write mood muzik know a lot of you aint used to
jot my life on wax im puttin you through it
no lies its all truth to it
do the music cause its
fans wanted the real i went and gave it to em
im not a street nigga nah just relate to em
i just relay through em
show the way to em never fake to em that aint
dont be afraid show the world who you are
go and show the world you a star
reach to the stars go ahead show the world that its ours
and then the worldll know that its
forty acres and a mule to forty ks on the mueller
see im just thinkin of ways to get my dudes up
they use to say we was losers
i beg to differ that aint me now

they say if you dont stand for nothin youll fall for anything
cause of that there i see the whole game on the ground
watchin what works we all chasin a hit
instead of takin a risk so we changin our sound now
now we all chase jewels big trucks and income
all that and then some chase whatever trend come
at least til the trends done
but that dont change within none
and im not sayin to not have a benz son
rings that shiny whatever things timely
those things help to unwind me
but naw those things dont help define me
aim at the basics aim you can make it
cause even when the whole game seems tainted
im a star without the chains and the bracelets
cause that fly shit is


two years waits up still sleep wake up
dawg so lemme help niggas understand mouse
dawg why try to fit in when you a stand out
its no album but the money never ran out
aside from rap im kinda focused on land now
cause i dont know whurr the game is
i know we jus been attacked by a hurricane chris
some niggas cant fathom what money and fame is
or some niggas get it by usin they stainless
or some niggas get it but they cant sustain it
me im regular joe i dont let it change shit


some niggas wanted to kill me got locked up and never found me
so my goal is to catch a charge in that same county
picture me gettin bumped for a silly hand off
the bullpens fucked up just ask willie randolph
see i could pop a few nickel plated glocks too
its easier to kill niggas than it is not to
i let the pot brew then the plot grew
it the labels job to label you dont fit it and theyll drop you
finally made a move on something i been saw
sometimes you got to lose the fight
if you tryin to win the war im focused on tomorrow
im done seein my friends in the rearview thinkin we really closer than we are
fuck the record label
no relation or correlation all my admiration just turned aggravation they say
how you sit so long when you spew classics
i tell niggas i cant understand thats that blue magic
the rap game as is either you on some snap shit
or plan ol stuck in a different decade like the brat is
i hear niggas joints and take it personal why
now everybody want to spit about their personal lives
before that was non existent
me im an addict with an addition for anything that seems to cause friction
maybe im in a relationship with bad karma
what her past the somber maybe i attract drama yeah
undoubtedly my life is on some vhone shit
just adding some salt and pepper to reality while
other artists is obsessed with more toys
like lex coup beemers and benzes    theyre lost boys
un i kept brushing off my shoulder till the chip was going
left the benz at the dealers till the kit was on
i dont feel niggas songs
so while yall at the awards
im loading up on ratches thats the tip im on
flow is on acid i swear i would have the game mastered
if i wasnt so busy carrying baggage
calling god a bastard
calvin look way different in person
then they had him looking in his casket
im looking in his casket like he had no face
i was at a lost for words like fiasco gate
so i figured i say a prayer for em got on my knees quick
and realized i dont ever pray until i need shit
my soul achin trying to stay low maintenance
im stuck in hell waiting on
blessing with no patience
i done made the ave hot
been had to stab shot
waiting on my jackpot
always been a have not
always been an under dog little guy still try
cause i think im a cash cow they treat me like im milk dry
juggling nickels and dime im walking a fine line
sometimes you got to just breath maybe give time time
give me a sign kind of shock he wont
see i want another baby but my pockets dont
normally that wouldnt bother me
till i wake up and get the paper and
read that some rich nigga won the lottery
young black and shameless
shorty keep beefing about the same shit
almost like yelling her second language
why do i entertain it
listen we been arguing about everything for ages do it ever change shit
wind up igging each other for the whole week
its a lot of men in this world baby you chose me like i chose you
we been rocking for years you signed up
you not a victim you a volunteer its weird
im not a cheater on occasion still fuck a bitch
who knows why maybe just to feel coveted
im me shes her we both had enough of it
but wont leave we the only ones who put up with it
in all areas its like my stocks crashing
wishing all these old motherfuckers would stop rapping
tryna be tasteful not mad or rageful
upset or hateful not complacent im grateful
and i dont wanna resort back to my old ways
theres no stairway to heaven less you the


we call this one send him our love
rest in peace to stack bundles


look what up ray was speechless i aint know what to say
got the call like at eight am with nate saying

member comin up dudes talkin bout hoes boastin
i was just a juvenile movin in slow motion
i dropped outta school to be a dude with mad jewelry
once i got it shit wasnt even cool to me
i dreamt of condos and video vixens
until i learned most girls in videos is pidgeons
i just wanted the world to see that i was for real with it
wanted a deal i got it and couldnt deal with it
i want me and my old homeboys to still kick it
i wish they saw me as mouse and not a meal ticket
let the beat play i wish i could see a day wit no he say she say just wanna see trey
wanna play the hood and not fuck with the toasters
middle child wish me and my brother was closer
i wanna scream at her catch myself before i start to
and then remember it takes two people to argue
all she do is provoke me all i do is diss her
all i did was shake her she say that i hit her
she just takin everythin i say out of context
im tryin not to black im like a nigga with a complex
was mad as a fuck didnt even show it
yesterday was better off didnt even know it
complete role reversal so its useless these days
tv got real music went fake please help her for gods sake
when i proposed to the game i figured life was merry

maybe i should pick up a pen and try n force it
same old story guts and no glory they tryna low ball me do him like joe torre

maybe niggas thought my knees gonna buckle
newport in my mouth with two gs on the buckle

spanish broad with them two ds like i love you
but sexy lady it was nice to know you gotta move on
they cant chink my armor a nigga to strong
i think niggas is shady but the proofs gone
i put the jewls on case fools thought it was gone youve been warned

i tried to told dudes way back in two
that eventually the game would go back to being soul food

major paper cake by the layers

when them tools go pop it move whole blocks
come around with your dog and get kujo shot
these mcs is lame i try to be a mc with brains
these niggas is mc brains
being nice rappers is far from being nice
im on the rooftop recording niggas is being sniped
its like


the soundtrack to my life is like cnn first shit
images like cnn but worse shit
i would down the whole pinot gris
but id see the group home without the primo beats
and it hurts my soul
im a warrior so though the odds is against a nigga dirk gon choke
some people confide in the person that they sleep with
ive learned theres no such thing as a secret
i cant describe the feeling i get
you was riding shotgun i was wheeling the whip
shit i even let you rock out being bill belichick
tapin from the sidelines stealin my shit
but dawg you was like a mini me mocked me envied me
turns out you was blowin hot air kenny g
but you was cool accepted you instantly
not a groupie but you had a few tendencies
and though we share a few memories
couple wrong turnsll turn a friend to an enemy
see phony people like phony people
even you could be mistaken if you phone these people look
when you invite the nerds to the cool table
and you a little smarter than the average dude
so it took a nigga just a little longer to see
they tried to warn me fought with my girl erry night about you
shit only hurts cause she was right about you

she run around wanting to shoot you the fair one
i keep telling her chill i dont care none
i got another side i never showed to you
the side where everybody is disposable
see relationships are never a threat
cause ill erase the history and act like we never met
become done giving a fuck and done calling
i got your e mail i was done way before then

dear diary i dont wanna keep shit inside of me
id rather just speak to you privately
maybe its my mood as far as i can see
theres really no point in having this guy with me

change from the days of us getting in your truck
its bigger than one song its bigger than a buck
its bigger than me bigger than buck
bigger than voodoo its bigger than luck shit its bigger than us

i always call niggas fools for wanting to learn the hard way
when im really the fool for tryna teach em
when the blinds leading the blind you cant reach em
if niggas aint as hungry as you then why feed em
niggas aint tryna be lead then why lead em
having big problems with your dogs why breed em
ill keep my part up keep my guard up
was like thundercats but changed faster than cheetara

this a small part of a larger issue
sometimes acceptance is so hard to get to
but we all equal no one lower or above me
i love my team just as much as they love me
if not more
if i turn the knob we all going through the door i aint coming back for yall
the whole crew feel the same as me
how could you ignore something so plain to see
im being ignant that get on my nerves every minute
whats plain to some is really burberry printed

being so real sometimes is a slow kill
we was one squad you broke out like mike schofield
i want fillet mignon you want oatmeal
add up our differences equals up to no meal
no mills yup no deal why you gotta chase sht
to know its no thrills for real

a nigga still beefin with his baby momma
only thing my baby aint a baby no more
hit her on myspace maybe she aint shady no more
sent old girl a message no reply but she read it
some things are so embedded and our heads is
looking for os but get xs dealing wit ya exes
i was one long line away from the tetris
she sent me the l that sent me to hell

to the point where im denied my son
i dont see him dont talk to him i dont greet him dont walk wit him
but i pay for him like hes an object
no matter how right i am in court i cant object
dear diary how could she deny me
how she go to bed without it fucking with her psyche
is she wrong using him so i can come back
am i wrong for wishing i could get my cum back
looking for sun all i see is the hail
how im gon trust all i see is betrayal
its like they keep trying more and more to subdue me
and only you understand signed by yours truly


lets talk about the struggle lets talk about the pain
some people say they love you but that dont mean a thang
some folks is so naive not me i go insane
some people dap you they hug you they do it all in vain
thats my depression talking maybe its really real
maybe them doctors was right and maybe im really ill
see i cant really chill without feeling the guilt of me
stealing these pills is anybody feeling me still
except for the hood nobody told me i ever could instead i pushed
back when they told me i never would looking at me like i was just a crook
i express the hood and what i see on the daily
my scenery daily task force bes daily
a task yall being me daily they want to put three in me nail me
this is stuff you only read in the daily
had product but aint supply it then high off more than weed
so the product just got me higher then product of my environment
look at where they put me and look where they telling me i gotta be
stop and see the robberies the poverty naw fam its not for me
its got to be an opt at least without dudes getting chased by police
so they gave us film sports and the gift to make a hot cd
back to the wall against the ropes nothings believable feasible
they dont believe in you youve been verbally beaten to
a pulp so the result to you think nothing is reachable
reasonable i tell you dreams come true yeah haters even you

now take your hands and wave em high they told me i cant but i said why
like fuck it ill try not fuck it and die
see this is real emotion we deal wit often and dont reveal it
often we stuff it inside but im like fuck it lets ride
i do what i do because i do what i do what i feel
they do what they do in hopes of what they do may appeal
they got a image and persona that they gotta fill
that they better do for revenue so labels will be thrilled
kind of feel like a wanted man
i cant talk to folk cause when i ask em to trust me all they wanna do is judge me im feeling like they dont understand
im feeling like aint too many people friendly
i feel like aint too many people are what they pretend to be cause im in that zone i feel alone like everybody is against me
just feel like im worst enemy and naw its not a cry for no sympathy
im just thinking out loud to a crowd im just trying to figure out some remedy
almost like every lesson its like every jewel every tool thats ever been lent to me
but the moment is gone im like a new born i feel like a man with no memory
slow it down for a second make sure im not losing you
or confusing you
im delusional if you never been there then you have no idea what illusions do
through and through im hoping these signs aint vital
or none of these rhymes inside the recital
why do it mean im suicidal i aint that houston dude
but im a maniac
dont get over drunk or sober this the same way id act
and im striving to pull together but at least until these voices inside of me
go forever be alarmed im liable to do whatever


youre now hearin hip hop at its finest
im just criminal minded
the ed hardy with the fine fit
track just started no need to rewind it

metal spit leave em on the field like everett
i does my own stunts like the jackie chan movie
mismatch belt prada but the pants louie
if you aint fair to me then your whole camp sushi
rockin iceberg when niggas didnt understand snoopy
damn moolies chain of commands ran through me

and i hate to blow a homie on your mans
you aint kid rock cant box the tommy with your hands

uh take a sip of ej then a little puff or two
get some butt then kick out the slut yous a bugaboo
weak dressers in the ring im mr wonderful
paul orndorff man yall all soft and huggable
yall dealin with a pro here that dont care
yall stiff and worn out like a closet with old gear
and i aint goin nowhere
producers know im the best thing over those snares
but you speakers whack ortiz i overdose like the needles packed
i bes in a zone then i give the speakers back

hold up joell the ethers back
see im raps larry johnson redid my contract now the chief is back
so blame it on fatigue
have you like greg oden injured before your first game in the league
im spendin old faces niggas took my style
gotta steal my own shit back like oj did
might size you and your spouse have guys go in your house
with ridges on the nose of the rifle like alf
pow


they say hip hop is dead or on life support
maybe not that could be something i just thought
i just ought to jump in fighting the sport
how you expect to be heard when your mic is off
i would love to go and browse through the robb report
but aint a car in that motherfucker i can afford
see niggas trying to block the road
rather then my label drop the growth they should drop us both
see i could scream def jam and what they used to be
but that aint for me to say thats for you to see
if not method man or redman ghostface young gunz
need i say freeway the proof is me
still dont believe me then wheres peedi peedi
they aint really giving a fuck unless you jeezy
thats what my mind say
just know if you aint the president or kanye you wont see the time of day

im so thankful that
come around these parts
we dont crank or snap we aim and clap
used to try to take the average rap fan show em shit
but if they close minded who am i to open it
rather spend time with a bougie broad
mean an actress bad bitch movie star
shallow bitches only into jewelry cars
still fuck with us though that aint who we are
soon as my wife gone they jump on the python
they aint know im out to hit and run like saigon
putting back the ice on had it screwed up
finally figured out that hate is the new love
but i dont see how you get ahead that way
when you team up with envy like red cafe
and all that blame is yours
you trying to get a chain like floss
im trying to get a chain like stores
find me in jers line for squeeze work off safety
cant keep calm around these jerks think beyond these words
treat the hood like myspace either become friends with the tommy first
so get found on the back of an empty carton
spray semi larkins for the bread like remy martin
dont mind me last of a dying breed
wanna take rap and bring it back to the ninetys
juicy inspired me cream made me angry
the mediall say anything to get at you
niggas is transparent im lookin right past you
henny is a bad dude talkin bout he act rude
so my new tattoo is god with a gavel
told baby girl if you wanna seduce me
just know my brain works like a bonaduce
my girlfriend say i use my charm too loosely
i tell her im too fly to have to con for coochie
hella paper tell a hater crib got a elevator
on the waterfront so yeah i oughta front
still times i feel like carryin chrome
or cheatin the system like im marion jones
tryin to sing for the moment cant find the note
put the game in a choke hold cant find his throat
hang with the big dogs cant find the rope
they tell me its alive i cant find the pulse so my


now look im in that five point zero feelin like chuck liddell
aside from rampage jackson its fuck the world

even if her body make a nigga want eat that
bitch you dont make a nigga better better see fab
i know a bird named amy love to tea bag
set you up right for some loosies and a weed bag
alcoholic cute face but her weave bad
and she went to the winehouse straight from the rehab
the recap rappers and they g stacks
fixated on imaginary ice like freeze tag
i speed past ease past with my g swag
im at a level most niggas couldnt see past

whoa whoa some say skys the limit still im tryin to reach higher
so on my deathbed im figurin how to be fly
im talkin above heaven
but talkin about death is me beatin a dead horse and a nigga love slevin
im a eightys baby with a sixtys mind state yankee fitted backwards
lookin at whippersnappers
livin young and reckless never mind who the best is
they need to get rid of their style put it on craigslist
cause you aint crazy stop it
even if you was wild like randy moss start feelin patriotic
how im gon lose with tom brady in the pocket
beggin dude to come back like the yankees did the rocket
and just like clemens did
reappear to get the most wins it in damn dickheads is so sensitive
pussies get hemorrhages find a way to benefit
even when it seem the whole world is against the kid

whoa i mean the burners in the air
like j holiday ill put you permanently there
its bedtime niggas weapon of mine niggas wesson or nine niggas
minority report im ahead of your mind niggas
you wanted to beef you got twenty with you i got a hundred with me
now this is somethin to see
boogieman your whole squad put you under some sheets
in that dodge richard reid had under the sheet


even though they hate em  even though when a nigga try to make a come up
 its another nigga waitin just to run up
though they sellin rocks for shorts
and every night around twelve you hear them shots go off
and know niggas is rats some boys is wired
and the food in the supermarkets all expired
every blocks a liquor store an abandoned building
drunk parents at the liquor store abandonin children
though the sky seems gray well get through the weather
and even though they fill our grade schools with metal detectors
some cops is crooked and police indecent
and you can catch a body up the street from the precinct
though we got a lot of shit wrong a lot of shit goin on
gotta love it this the place i was born so i sit here dedicatin this song
this is still my hood

you know they got them macs out until ya times up
and the barbersll fuck ya line up
hold up cause even though
you cant meet a girl aint fucked a nigga you know
this the same place you cant get a job
they look at you like you young and you black
get the fuck out of dodge
get a gun get some crack feel like thats our only op
tell ourselves well fall back as soon as that money stop
they feast on ya watch
and dudes stand on the corner like if life passes us by at least we
wanna watch
clowns get extorted  gangstas get recorded
mami dont know if she should keep it or abort it
cops youll never will catch me im aware all my warrants
and im not goin down  naw thats not goin down
carjackings shootouts is imperial here
and i dare you find a ratchet with the serial yeah
though you might have to raise ya gun just to raise ya sums
this aint the place you want to raise ya son
a few dudesll argue about they favorite rapper
other dudes sit and think of different ways they could yak ya
dont take it personal its just the paper they after
so i keep mine on me just in case i might have to
and still no other place that id rather
gotta love my hood

if youve never been you cant really know about it
systems fucked up the jails is overcrowded
murder rates is up and as a matter of fact
a couple of close friends of mine have added to that
and i rate nothin above it i know it seems odd but i hate it and i love it
naw i hate that i love it
the same things that seem to get me always pissed
as soon as i leave i always miss its always like this
so small everybody knows everybody
its body after body its robbery after robbery


yo yo please lord somethin gotta give
they say for every negative theres a positive
but i aint positive for every buck deposited
we still in the hood livin like hostages and never mind colleges
school of hard knocks scholarship dealin with politics
i would just sell success in the store if i could bottle it
but i aint a millionaire wont see me in forbes son
life is like a  when you can afford one
ruger loaded just in case the war come
might as well everything is comin to the forefront
need a clear head just to think
and fuck a  nigga im two steps from a drink
the pressure either bust pipes or it make diamonds
no matter how high up the mountain i stay climbin
freedom i keep chancin
so if i fall like beyonce i just get back up and keep dancin


uh let me talk to em real quick la look look
im chasin after pies with bags under my eyes
you lookin at my representative mask its a disguise
and i dont do things like i used to
the past is the past  im presently thinkin about the future
certain niggas bettin i fall
im speed joggin through the quicksand im jugglin three medicine balls
see im comin up used to share a room with two cellmates
now i tower over the devil but this aint hell date
long way to go i see my feet gettin blisters
i dare em talk to me like mike richards
or play don imus and think its cool to disrespect our sisters
i guess we got a while fore they actually get the picture
i think about virginia tech think about katrina
niggas that caught sean bell slippin with the nina
a day before the wedding safety off the weapon
though all these things play in my head i keep steppin


yo yo

jerome type jealous used to come through clappin at niggas
that put they hands on her
cause of the insanity fired her from fantasies
every mans fantasy sufferin from vanity
i member she went broke for a short stint
so she started fuckin niggas just to pay her rent
started fuckin anybody that would get her bent
frequentin hotels and cars with dark tints
but she never home in the world fulfillin her greed
its a disease grandmother takin care of her seeds
now everybody she be with  keep gettin her weeded
she dropped out of school felt it was no longer needed
low self esteem a broken home and shattered dreams
got chyna comin out of her jeans
get money by any means wearin anything thats skin tight
pretties up the outside to cover up whats inside
that one time bad bitch  dont even look average
borrows her friends clothes no more money for saks fifth
jerome proposed now they awaitin marriage
little did he know how many niggas had smashed it
dre used to pipe her them two was creepin
it was more than just beatin im guessin he really liked her
dre got a girl maybe not with the label
see her name is faith but he aint never been faithful
she used to get raiseful yellin out i hate you
been with him since he was broke and he aint grateful
now the niggas able financially stable
but she turned the tables went and got some other mates too
that never stopped her from rummagin through his shit
dre neglectin home fuckin around with this bitch
takin her on vacas pick her up for late stays
spent his whole check on her damn near every pay day
already fought rome when he caught dre at the strip club
chyna givin him a lap dance gettin her tits rubbed
zipper down like he just finished gettin his dick sucked
rome threw his fists up but dre couldnt give a fuck
security kicked em out speakers blastin dj unk
i saw jerome runnin over towards his trunk
but chyna came and stopped it before jerome popped it
dre aint learn nothin kept creepin he aint stop shit
i tried to talk to him he aint heed the message

and cant even run from the law you too sick
jerome wasted no time findin where dude live
he came in blazin that fifth in dudes ribs
thats two individuals gone for gods sake
jerome went to jail three days after her wake
dres girl at home in shock she cant believe it
wishin she wouldve told him about her big big secret


look i dont give a fuck again
thoughts in my head
looking like a nigga stuck with them
wishing it abruptly ends
but god woke him up again
everything is seeming so unfair so unclear
trying to reach out no ones there
four walls tell em go run where no one cares
screaming this too shall pass
riding on fumes without gas
bills piling up without cash
tryna maintain and outlast
pray for me keep telling niggas patiently wait for me
keep telling haters wait and see
im busy tryna fill a vacancy
know a long time its taking me
muhfuckas keep mistaking me
mistakenly they caging me
niggas never had no faith in me
its like im one semi from death
im just a few pennies from debt
i got no identity left victim of identity theft
problems never new its revenue
keep blaming em its never you
keep telling baby girl im gon leave and never do
cause even when a nigga needs space
when you looking for a little leeway
somebody put it on replay
its like it gets louder with each day pray

look look
im tryna keep it formal now
but the pressures on him now
ill go ahead and warn you now
im tryna come across as normal now
all my life ive been called insane
looked at as if im strange
cant tame em
cant blame em for looking at me as if i cant change
with that said still ima rise
though i keep it still in lies
go ahead reveal your disguise
maybe thatll kill the surprise
sometimes i feel deprived
starting when the guilt arrive
i noticed that the hills have eyes
when you on the heels of demise
and your mans on a ledge
niggas tampering with my head
i aint getting head in the phantom
a phantoms in my head
cant escape figured id be a candidate
i aint gotta upper hand to date cant be fate
must think that i can handle weight
see im thinking of mansions lakes
i was thinking mandalay
thinking id expand my stay
thats just the chance ill take
bow to my knees so the crowds appeased
put em in the mouth of the beast
crazy they didnt make him out to be
im just tryna make it out at least please


something mustve changed me niggas might defame me
but things that used to taint me no longer seem to restrain me
strangely im no longer sad mad or angry
shame ably it pains me feeling like it just aint me
mainly what do i tell all the people that thank me
namely those who ordain me aside from can you blame me
motivation the game was supplying me its no longer providing me
jason williams something killed whatever was driving me
worrying less about the past more about the now
less about what im going through more about the how
its for certain spent thirty years being fit for hurdling
now im a different person with nothin to overcome and i miss the burden
for certain got six figures in my sock drawer
and honestly this year i expect to make a lot more
its hard to live without a budget when life is corrupted
in a house thats so peaceful that im trying to disrupt it
scream fuck it not because i have to but because i love it
which makes me as fake as the puppets that i speak of disgusted
without a paddle up shits creek
dig deep and see it aint life its just me
so be warned as im putting on like im reformed
only so yall can accept it as being my norm
maybe i quit working on me maybe i given up
maybe i been lying to myself maybe i give a fuck

i say it loud hoping someone can hear me clearly
trying to make my girl get it she dont know that its very scary
but shes a nympho she can be barely near me
she still want the god in her think she mary mary
the prettiest bitches just want to service me
while niggas prettiest bitches wouldnt get a word from me
some of you havent heard from me some of you wouldnt mind murking me
find that news funny likes its straight from ron burgundy
these niggas aint never seen dough
they can dream though i bump into em in between shows
people say im emo what that really mean though
is though the song cant breathe i actually make it seem so
i lost loved ones because they couldnt deal with me
cherish whoever still with me though the merits been killed in me
normally its just me and my lonely mind
everyone storm is different so this forecast is only mine
fans recognize my misery uplifted me
shifted me to my epitome guess the curse is a gift to me
maybe its serendipity maybe its weighing on me physically
maybe i should man up and tell god not to solicit me
been medicated meditated sedated hated
character assassinated all theses years i masqueraded
hard headed if it was on my mind i had to say it
tongue on the devils pitchfork to see how disaster tasted
rap is fabricated rappers are so exaggerated
wouldnt be scared of the truth if they werent castrated
grab a mag spray it surrounded by people that shoot it before me
thatll unconditionally love my beautiful ugly
now lemme speak to who i cater to
would you love me the same if all my weeks were not favorable
promised to maintain being unique but relate able
all while suffering from a disease that can do away with you


yall in that mood yet
yall in that mood yet
if i died tomorrow
see if i died tomorrow
yo yo yo yo yo

i woke up around nine day felt like no other
kissed wifey on the forehead told her that i love her
thinking as i look for where my car keys at
i know it aint promised ill be back
whether from a disease or from a bullet
i wouldnt be mad i lived my life to the fullest
i drove cars that i never thought i would
i fucked broads never thought i could
id be in heaven with the folk that raised me
grandma jimmy great grandma daisy
least id be around some people thats just like me
least id be around my uncle mikey
i know moms would probably be hysterical
for twentyfive years she seen me be a miracle
seen me come a long way just by being lyrical
naw i aint act religious but god know me to be spiritual
if i died tomorrow wouldnt feel like its wrong
i aint expect to be here this long
they told me before i get twentyone that they would have my
grave handy
two years later nominated for a grammy
vibe awards kev said i probably shouldnt go with him
he aint think i wouldnt make it good at the podium
fans wanting the best for me
i couldnt be there as i won but treach all my jersey
heads rep for me
if i died tomorrow then what would it mean
already feel like im livin my dream
came across some pretty interesting folk
i met some new people
aint move alot of units but touched a few people
so i might get frustrated fuckin wit the hood son
but everyday above ground is a good one
walk out the door and leave it in gods hands
if i go its just part of gods plan
will life carry out the same
well at least my little man can carry out the name
and look i can say i lived my life without stress
if i died tomorrow im fine i been blessed yes
i made some money and true i couldve had more
but hes happy and what more could he ask for
if it was no diamonds and no begets
i still would have no worries i got no regrets
i made my mom proud and pop feels the same way
but hes a man so he probably got too much pride to say
cant count my blessings on one hand more than a handful
and god aint send nothin my way i couldnt handle

yo if i died tomorrow
throw a little liquor in the sky
im good here dont ask god why dont cry
i did everything i wanted left nothin unturned
roll sumtin light it let it burn
if i died tomorrow
naw i dont wanna die tomorrow said i dont wanna
die tomorrow
well just in case remember my ways remember my face
for all that remember my place
i love me
best thing about dying tomorrow i wont see anybody i love leave
so if the lord take me dont re incarnate me
i dont wanna come back and please dont make me
dont cry just wave goodbye
let all my songs rock smile at me in the sky
dont pour liquor ill save niggas some hennessey
just play a spades game slame a card in my memory i speak my mind
i roll a blunt with god know he smoke sumtin better than any weed you can find
so pass that jesus
you gotta get high to think of all these diseases that
put us right where he is
damn imma miss my mans miss my chick miss my fam
miss my fans
the world is like jail this is like debang
so now take it all back i wont miss a thing
im feelin pretty wise
and death i can take off this disguise
when it come just let it be a surprise
id rather it quickly
i may not be remembered as the best thats cool long as yall dont forget me
now who the fuck you think is living to this day
i try to tell my young niggas crime dont pay
so i hope ma dukes can understand where i was
and hope trey can be a better man than i was
i dont wanna live to be eighty
lifes a cycle
the older you get more you live like a baby
you could barely move folk gotta be there for you
diapers on niggas gotta take care of you
learn shit all over again
skin wrinkled ya memory gone and you a memory gone
least in three i made a few folk dance
i wanna thank def jam cuz they gave me a chance
wanna thank my street niggas
the show me the streets niggas
when its your turn im at the pearly gates to greet niggas
when it was beef niggas
snatch the heat niggas
said mouse you a star give that back to me niggas
my nigga big perm fuck being a hype man
since lincoln high school my nigga been my right hand
dude mk already know that i love him
you like a third brother you past being a cousin
the mother of my baby for giving me my baby

heights still and du cant forget dub b
held me down when i aint know how to love me
i mean back in the days i felt so ugly
i cant say why bitches always dug me

just say he repped jers like nobody before him
look i can say i lived my life without stress
if i died tomorrow im fine i been blessed yes
