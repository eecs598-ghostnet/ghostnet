whos the king
came from the bottom nigga with stains on my shirt
what you expected from me i came from the dirt
whos the king
money my motivator the songs that i sing
picture a peasant passin from pawn to a king
you tell me ya still love me if so then let me go
will i return or will i burn never know
look in my eyes and see the future
but dont sugar coat it

listen
history repeats itself and thats just how it goes
same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
same thing that my nigga elvis did with rock n roll
justin timberlake eminem and then macklemore
while silly niggas argue over who gon snatch the crown
look around my nigga white people have snatched the sound
this year ill prolly go to the awards dappered down
watch iggy win a grammy as i try to crack a smile
im just playin but all good jokes contain true shit
same rope you climb up on theyll hang you with
but not jermaine my aim too sick
i bang nigga i came to bring the pain my brain too quick
you see how i maneuver this game i aint stupid
i recognize that life is a dream and i dream lucid
and break the chains and change minds
one verse at a time and claim twentysix
and fuck it if the shoe fits whos the king

we all kings
we all kings nigga
kings of ourselves first and foremost
true
while the people debate whos the king of this rap game
here comes lil ol jermaine
with every ounce of strength in his veins
to snatch the crown from whoever yall think has it
but rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
poof boom paow its like magic
with a flash and a bang the crown disintegrates
and falls to the earth from which it came
its done
aint gonna be no more kings
be wary of any man that claims
because deep down he clings onto the need for power
the reality hes a coward
ultimately hes scared to die
and sometimes so am i
but when im in tune with the most high
i realize the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
today i know that we are the same are the same you and i
different kind of skin different set of eyes
two different minds but only one god
its only one god nigga
its for all the kings
cause i know deep down every poet just wanna be loved


oh right oh

somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
be like this be like this
somebody shoulda told me it would be like this

yeah life is a balance
you lose your grip you can slip into an abyss
no doubt you see these niggas trippin
ego in charge of every move hes a star
and we cant look away due to the days that he caught our hearts
hes fallin apart but we deny it
justifying that half ass shit he dropped we always buy it
when he tell us he a genius but its clearer lately
its been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
there was a time when this nigga was my hero maybe
thats the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
cause i believed him when he said his shit was purer and he
the type of nigga swear he real but all around hims fake
the women the dickriders you know the yes men
nobody with the balls to say somethin to contest him
so he grows out of control
into the person that he truly was all along its startin to show
damn wonder what happened
maybe its my fault for idolizin niggas
based off the words they be rappin
but come to find out these niggas dont even write they shit
hear some new style bubblin up then they bite this shit
damn thats what i get for lyin to myself
well fuck it whats more important is hes cryin out for help
while the worlds eggin him on im beggin him to stop it
playin his old shit knowin he wont top it
false prophets

i got a homie he a rapper and he wanna win bad
he want the fame the acclaim the respect thats been had
by all the legends so every time i see him he stressin
talkin bout niggas dont fuck with him this shit is depressin
and i know he so bitter he cant see his own blessings
goddamn nigga you too blind to see you got fans nigga
and a platform to make a classic rap song
to change a niggas life but you too anxious livin life
always worried bout the critics who aint ever fuckin did it
i write whats in my heart dont give a fuck who fuckin with it
but in a sense i can relate the need to be great
turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late
writin words hopin people observe the dedication
that stirs in you constantly but intentions get blurred
do i do it for the love of the music or is there more to me
do i want these niggas to worship me
false prophets

somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
be like this be like this
somebody shoulda told me it would be like this be like this
false prophets lalalalalala lalala
somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
be like this be like this
somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
yeah false prophets

these rappers insecure
they talk about being a man so much
i finally understand that they aint even sure
bout who they are and why they do this
guess im included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory
my highest moments come from tellin all the saddest stories
ive seen in my life i be fiendin to write
songs that raise the hair on my arms
my lowest moments came from tryin too hard
to impress some niggas that couldnt care if im on
therefore from here on out my hair grow out
i care nothin bout opinions
i wanna give hope like the fountains you throw pennies in
hit the store take your diss make your wish
this is dedicated to the ones that listen to me on some faithful shit
im on some thankful shit
but the real god is in you not the music you coppin
i hear my old shit and know i can top it
false prophets

somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
be like this be like this
somebody shoulda told me it would be like this be like this
false prophets lalalalalala lalala
somebody shoulda told me it would be like this

but you see the sad thing fuckin with her is
is the chick aint even have brains dummy like a bitch
so i tried to show her about the world
and about just who we really are
and where weve come and how we still have to go really far
like baby look at how we live broke on the boulevard
but all she ever want me to do is unhook her bra
then all i really want is for her to go down low
before you know it she wet enough to get drowned slow
and all that deep shit i was previously down fo

so that every word i spoke well im tryna put her on
but she couldnt hear me
i told her all about how we been livin a lie
and that they love to see us all go to prison or die
like baby look at how they show us on the tv screen
but all she ever want me to do is unzip her jeans
then all i really want is for her to get on top
before you know it she workin jerkin it nonstop
and all that next shit i was previously talkin

yeah whats up girl

angel eyes long hair i see you cryin whats wrong there
he did what he fucked who we know the story whats new
see i could probably rush you tell you that he shoulda loved you
take advantage fuck you tell you ill do all the shit he wouldnt do
but the truth is we all the same on different teams but its all a game
the objective tryna score you got a wife you find a whore
you fuck her fast she find her drawers pull up her pants you find the door
you drive her home she mop you off you bust again and drop her off
then repeat like an episode why we cheat ill never know
is it cause we rap heavens no lotta niggas rap though never blow
like heterosexuals girl you fine from head to toe
could it be cause my father let me know that he cheated and somehow
i never told i never told

father hey you wanna be a man
son yeah i wanna be a man
father a man dont run and tell his mama everything he see
son i aint gon tell
father alright alright then man be a man then
son alright

ok thats what it is i see the game the hoes come the seasons change
the hoes go we rearrange fuck up her life shell never be the same
the ogs that beat the game forever young peter pan
thirtyfive still playing child support still paying
juggling bill paying been running round field daying
wine and dine meal paying with hopes that shell lay in
the bed and get wet then give head then you bet man
the same girl who said we just met man game colder than the fucking dead man
one night stands no best man no bridesmaids or reverends
cause wolverines depressed and dont wanna be your exman
cause cupid aims and throw the darts there go the sparks and broken hearts
who wanna build noahs ark just to have that shit torn apart

wife you know what i need to talk to you
husband about what
wife i dont think this is working out for us
husband why
wife i mean i need some space i mean no i just wanna find myself thats all
husband what the fuck
wife you know


i put my heart and soul in this game im feelin drained
unappreciated unalleviated
tired of comin up shortfuck abbreviated
want my whole name spelled out my own pain spilled out
no pain no gain i blow brainscobain
throw flames liu kang the coach aint help out so i call my own shots
im david blaine im breakin out of my own box you stay the same
but homie if you change may you change for the better
back when martin king had a thing for coretta
wonder if she seen all the dreams he was dreamin
did she have a clue of all the schemes he was schemin
still loved him just enough to put up with the cheatin
months go by and only see him for a weekend
i say a prayerhope my girl aint leavin
we all got angels we all got demons
as you fall through the club
bad bitches down to do all the above
money comes fast so bein hungry dont last
till you look in the mirror and you saw who you was
cole worldit couldnt be more clearer
the time is nowcouldnt be more hereer
my reign gonna last like thirtyfour eras
say hello to the real i can be your hero

gone and i aint lookin back
i know they gone feel it like they tank on e
i promise baby you can bet the bank on me
cause cant nobody tell me what i aint gonna be no more
you thinking ima fall dont be so sure
i wish somebody made guidelines
on how to get up off the sidelines

up in onest class laugh even though its not funny
see a white man wonder how the fuck i got money
while he sit at coach hate to see me walk past im
young black pants sag headphones blastin
know what he askin how did he manage
with all the cards against him he used them to his advantage
slang we be speakin probably soundin like spanish
then i fuck they heads up when a nigga show manners
some new york niggas thought it was funny callin us bama
laughin at the grammar cause they didnt understand us
mustve thought we slow but little do they know
i came up in here to take advantage of that shit yall take for granted
opportunity that i would kill for
lookin at rappers like what the fuck you got a deal for
when i was assed out with my funds low
its nice to know i had the whole world at my front door

hey ima put us all on the map
gone and i aint lookin back
i know they gone feel it like they tank on e
i promise baby you can bet the bank on me
cause cant nobody tell me what i aint gonna be no more
you thinking ima fall dont be so sure
i wish somebody made guidelines
on how to get up off the sidelines

i made it to the rock even though they tried to box me out
i got the key to the game they tried to lock me out
but what they dont understand is this is all plan
its a bigger picture and you cant photoshop me out
some nigga ask me why jay never shout me out
like im supposed to give a fuck
dont you know that i be out in france
where the fans throw they hands like pacquiao
not cause my looks cause my hooks could knock rocky out
and my lines is designed from the heart
young simba been a lion from the start
dumb niggas yall been lyin from the start
my lifes like a movie truly
and these niggas is dyin for the part
but youll never play me like lebron vs jordan
twenty years wonder who they gone say was more important
both changed the game came through and made a lane
whos to say that whos greater all we know they aint the same

hey ima put us all on the map
gone and i aint lookin back
i know they gone feel it like they tank on e
i promise baby you can bet the bank on me
cause cant nobody tell me what i aint gonna be no more
you thinking ima fall dont be so sure
i wish somebody made guidelines
on how to get up off the sidelines


i think its gonna be a hell of a night a hell of a night
so we could do whatever you like

it took me all day to find some inspiration
it just hit me like a ton of bricks no renovation
problem with the game now there aint no innovation

that blood type flowing through our veins is the same
my mama left you and it may be that angers to blame

i wanna talk about my days as a youth to you
exposing you to all my demons and the reasons im this way
i would like to paint a picture but itll take more than a day
it would take more than some years to get all over all my fears
preventing me from letting you see all of me perfectly clear
the same wall thats stopping me from letting go and shedding tears
from the lack of having father and the passing of my peers
while im too scared to expose myself
it turns out you know me better than i know myself
better than i know myself
well how bout that

she gets him you get me
she hugs him you kiss me
you tell me you miss me
and i believe you i believe you
she gets him you get me
she hugs him you kiss me
you tell me you miss me
and i believe you i believe you
catch me dont you
catch me dont you catch me
ive fallen in love for the first time


yeah for your eyes
for your eyes only for your eyes
for your eyes only for your eyes only
for your eyes for your eyes
for your eyes only

hey niggas be dying on the daily
it seems my dreams faded for far too long
the consequences deadly
cant visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
control the block serving up rocks and stay subliminal
cause young niggas is hardheaded they letting off
full of adrenaline ignorant to what death can cause
aint no coming back family dressed in black
plus its hot now the cops outside its hard to flip a pack
and my daughter gotta eat her mama be stressing me
like i aint the one who put them jays on her feet
like i aint out in the field like that
i might be low for the moment but i will bounce back
despite the charges back to the wall i fight regardless
screaming fuck the law my life is lawless
thats what you call it aint got to be no psychic
to see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
this is hell and i dont mean that hyperbolic
i try to find employment even if its wiping toilets
but these felonies be making life the hardest
resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
or run up on your yard snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
thats why i write this sonnet
if the pressure get too much for me to take and i break
play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
for your eyes let her know my life is on it
for your eyes for your eyes only

for your eyes do you understand
for your eyes do you understand me
for your eyes do you understand
for your eyes do you understand me
for your eyes do you understand
for your eyes do you understand me
for your eyes do you understand
for your eyes only

you probably grown now so this songll hit you
if you hearing this unfortunately means
that im no longer with you in the physical
not even sure if i believe in god but because you still alive
he got me praying that the spiritual is real
so i can be a part of you still my pops was killed too
so i know how part of you feels
maybe you hate me maybe you miss me maybe you spite me
life goes in cycles maybe youll date a nigga just like me
i hope not im tired of dope spots
and fiends that smoke rocks
ive seen far too many niggas hopes rot
im writing this because me and the devil had a dance
now i see death around the corner pologizing in advance
dont know if i ever had a chance
at a glance im a failure
addicted to pushing paraphernalia
but daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once
innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
my pops shot up drugrelated mama addicted
so granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
blood was staining the concrete
older niggas i loved talked like they was above
maintaining a timesheet thats slow money
picked up the family business by the age of thirteen
six years later was handed sentence
round the same time is when you came in this world
me and your mama thinking
what the fuck we naming this girl
i told her nina the prettiest name that i could think of
for the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen i was nineteen
took me two felonies to see the trap
this crookedass system set for me
and now i fear its too late for me to ever be
the one that set examples that was never set for me
im living fast but not fast enough
cause karma keeps on catching up to me
and if my past becomes the death of me
i hope you understand

for your eyes do you understand
for your eyes do you understand me
for your eyes do you understand
for your eyes do you understand me
for your eyes do you understand
for your eyes do you understand me
for your eyes do you understand
for your eyes only

its several ways i couldve went out too many to count
was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout
was it the young niggas blasting frustrated
cause the cash running out
niggas dont know how to act in a drought
see baby girl i realized
my definition of a real nigga was skewed
my views misshaped by new mixtapes
that confirmed the shit i learned in the streets was true
that real niggas dont speak when they beef with you
they just pull up on your street let the heat achoo
and if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your food
i was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops
ducking rules hugging blocks that dont love you
i pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
much broader than the corner if not its gon corner you
into a box where your son dont even know his pops
and the cyclical nature of doing time continues
my worst fear is one day that you come home from school
and see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news
i got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
and sadly if youre listening now it must mean its true
but maybe theres a chance that its not
and this album remains locked
in a hard drive like valuable jewels
and i can teach you this in person
like im teaching you to tie your own shoes
i love you and i hope to god i dont lose you
for your eyes only

for your eyes for your eyes only
for your eyes for your eyes only
for your eyes do you understand
for your eyes only

one day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling
what hed been dealing with lately he wasnt telling
i tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealing
but i could feel the sense of panic in his voice
and it was chilling he said
jermaine i knew you since we was children
i never asked for nothing when times was hard
i never had discussions with you begging you to help me
i dealt with the repercussions of my actions
i know you tried to steer me way from that shit
but that shit was in my blood you know my life
i know your momma nigga send my love
in case i never get a chance to speak again
i wont forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
thats the way i wished my family lived
but my granny crib was in the jects
i had to interject like
nigga what you talking bout fuck is you getting at
he said listen i got no time to dive into descriptions
but i been having premonitions
just call it visions from the other side
i got a feeling i wont see tomorrow
like the time im living on is borrowed
with that said the only thing im proud to say i was a father
write my story down and if i pass
go play it for my daughter when she ready
and so im leaving you this record for your eyes only
dont you ever scratch or disrespect it
this perspective is a real one another lost ville son
i dedicate these words to you and all the other children
affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
that sent your pops to prison when he needed education
sometimes i think that segregation wouldve done us better
although i know that means that i would never
be brought into this world cause my daddy was so thrilled
when he found him a white girl to take back to jonesboro
with lil zach and cole world barely one years old
now its thirty years later making sure this storys told
girl your daddy was a real nigga not cause he was cold
not because he was the first
to get some pussy twelve years old
not because he used to come through
in the caddy on some vogues
not because he went from bagging up
them grams to serving os
nah your daddy was a real nigga not cause he was hard
not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
not because he screamed fuck the law
although that was true
your daddy was a real nigga cause he loved you
for your eyes only


my intuition is telling me therell be better days yeah
my intuition is telling me therell be better days
i like this tone

yeah my intuition is telling me therell be better days
i sit in silence and find whenever i meditate
my fears alleviate my tears evaporate
my faith dont deviate ideas dont have a date
but see im growing and getting stronger with every breath
bringing me closer to heavens doors with every step
as we speak im at peace no longer scared to die
most niggas dont believe in god and so they terrified
its either that or they be fearing they gon go to hell
asking the father for forgiveness got em overwhelmed please god i want to go to heaven
as if hes spiteful like them white folks that control the jail
see i believe if god is real hed never judge a man
because he knows us all and therefore he would understand
the ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life
the bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife

i know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
but the only real change come from inside come from inside
but the only real change come from inside come from inside
but the only real change come from
in cemeteries or in chains i see men cry
but the only real change come from inside come from inside
but the only real change come from inside come from inside
but the only real change come from

yeah my chosen religion
jesus piece frozen from sinnin
doin dirt hoping to god he know my intentions
to see a million fore i see a casket
i got a baby on the way know he gon be a bastard
im living fast like im in a drag race how that cash taste
when i was a senior i was ballin on my classmates
niggas put three bullets in my car one hit the gas tank
know i got a angel cause im supposed to have a halo
right now my lifestyle destined for a federal facility
for my ability to make them birds fly
fiends wanna get higher than a birds eye view
and who am i to tell a nigga what to do
i just supply its economics
my business aint got the suit and tie
keep a pistol at all times niggas want whats mine
i cant oblige dog i work too hard
so reach for it get referred to god im going hard nigga

i know you desperate for a change let the pen glide
but the only real change come from inside
but the only real change come from inside
but the only real change come from
in cemeteries or in chains i see men cry
but the only real change come from inside
but the only real change come from inside
but the only real change come from

yeah prodigal son got a new gun
this one dont run out of ammo
lately been working on my handles
can i ball become a star and remain my self
if i fall dust it off and regain my self
fuck em all they dont know all the pain i felt
im in awe after all the fame i felt i evolved
i no longer bury demons i be a vessel for the truth until im barely breathing im singing

life is all about the evolution
i give up i give in i move back a little
i live up i look up now im back for more
you can dream but dont neglect the execution
i give up i give in i move back a little
i live up i look up now im back for more
time is short thats what somebody told me
i give up i give in i move back a little
i live up i look up now im back for more
too short to keep following your homies
i give up i give in i move back a little
i live up i look up now im back for more

i reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands
all of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram
finger on trigger make a little nigga understand
what its like to finally be the motherfuckin man
eyes wide thats from the power that the coward feels
niggas die over bitches disrespect and dollar bills
bloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield
i call it poison you call it real pop pop pop pop
thats how you feel

pistols be poppin and niggas drop in a heartbeat
scattered like roaches a body laid on the concrete
a body laid on the concrete
look somebody laid on the concrete
no time for that aint no lookin back cause im running too
i made it home i woke up and turned on the morning news
overcame with a feeling i cant explain
cause that was my nigga james that was slain he was twentytwo
last night at around he was twentytwo
twentytwo year old black male suspect reporting live

i swear to god bruh

i swear to god
to mourn the life of james mcmillan jr

or a nigga that could sing
and explain all the pain that it cost him

thats why i moved away i needed privacy
surrounded by the trees and ivy league
students thats recruited highly
thinkin you do you and i do me
crib has got a big ol back ol yard
my niggas stand outside and pass cigars
filled with marijuana laughin hard
thankful that they friends a platinum star
in the driveway theres no rapper cars

took a little break just to annotate
how i feel damn its late

live from the city where they pull cards
i got a glock forty and a little nine
ready for the day a nigga pull mine
niggas from the hood is the best actors
gotta learn to speak in ways thats unnatural
just to make it through the job interviews
if my niggas heard me theyd say

just trying to make it dog somehow
peeking through the blinds i see the sun now
i see youre still sleeping and it feels like
maybe everything is gon be alright


awwwwwhaha

now i was barely seventeen with a pocket full of hope
screamin dollar and a dream with my closet lookin broke
and my niggas lookin clean gettin caught up with that dope
have you ever served a fiend with a pocket full of soap
nigga i can tell you things that you probably shouldnt know
have you ever heard the screams when the body hit the floor
flashbacks to the pain wakin up cold sweats
six oclock in the mornin gotta hit the bowflex
get my weight up on the block keep watch for the cops
god they love to serve a nigga three hots and a cot
nowadays crime pays like a part time job
and the drought got me prayin for a carl thom vibe
summer rain come again
numb the pain cause its hard for a felon
in my mind i been cryin know its wrong but im sellin
eyes wellin up with tears

and she ride or die like eve and em
make homecooked meals every evenin
and even in your lowest days
when youre no longer superman at least you know you got lois lane
but you

runaway runaway
runaway runaway
im holdin on
desperately
runaway runaway
runaway runaway
im holdin on

yeah
unbelievable seen evil that not even knievel know
at age three i knew this world was three below
listen even though my ego low achieved the unachievable
imagine if my confidence was halfway decent yo
this just in fucked more bitches than bieber though
still i keep it low got my niggas on the need to know
basis my manager back in the days was racist
i was a young boy passing skates and tucking laces
old perverted white man who told me jermaine
its all pink on the inside fuck what color they face is
wise words from an indecent man
made me reflect on the times when we was threefifths of them
in chains and powerless brave souls reduced to cowardice
slaving in the baking sun for hours just
to see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
nine months later got a baby thats
not quite what you expected but you
refuse to neglect it cause you
know your wifey loves you thus you refuse to accept it
thats the type of shit that turned my granny lightskinned
rich white men rule the nation still
only difference is we all slaves now the chains concealed
in our thoughts if i follow my heart to save myself
could i run away from fiftymill like dave chappelle
you know

runaway runaway
runaway runaway
im holdin on
desperately
runaway runaway
runaway runaway
im holdin on


freedom or jail clips inserted a babys bein born
same time my man is murdered the beginning and end
as far as rap go its only natural i explain
my plateau and also what defines my name

yeah long live the idols may they never be your rivals
pac was like jesus nas wrote the bible
now what you bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
no id my mentor now let the story begin

i used to print out nas raps and tape em up on my wall
my niggas thought they was words but it was pictures i saw
and since i wanted to draw i used to read them in awe
then he dropped stillmatic rocked the cleanest velour
fast forward whod a thought that i would meet him on tour
im earnin stripes now a nigga got adidas galore
backstage i shook his hand let em know that hes the man
when he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
no time to soak up the moment though cause i was in a jam
hov askin wheres the record that the radio could play
and i was strikin out for months nineth inning feelin fear
jeter under pressure made the biggest hit of my career
but at first that wasnt clear niggas had no idea
dion called me when it dropped sounded sad but sincere
told me nas heard your single and he hate that shit
said you the one yo why you make that shit

i cant believe i let nas down
damn my heart sunk to my stomach
i cant believe i let nas down
i got defensive on the phone
resentment was in my tone fuck it

long live the idols may they never be your rivals
pac was like jesus nas wrote the bible
now what youre bout to hears a tale of glory and sin
no id my mentor now let the story begin

i couldnt help but think that maybe i had made a mistake
i mean you made you owe me
dog i thought that you could relate
but while i shot up the charts
you mean tellin me that i was not up to par
when i followed my heart
granted my heart was tainted
by my mind that kept on sayin
wheres the hits you aint got none
you know jayll never put your album out without none
and dog you know how come
labels are archaic formulaic with they outcome
they dont know they just study the charts
me i studied the shows the fans study they hearts
i had a feelin i was killin and this music we were spillin out
would change lives forever fuck the label put it out
friday night lights blew that was classic number two
now it seemed as if the nas comparisons was comin true
still no release date from the label are they insane
gucc told me play the game to change the game

but on the way i let nas down
i got no one to blame
im ashamed i let nas down
but this is gods plan you can never understand fuck it

long live the idols may they never be your rivals
pac was like jesus nas wrote the bible
now what youre bout to hears a tale of glory and sin
no id my mentor now let the story begin

i always believed in the bigger picture
if i could get them niggas to listen outside my core
then i can open the door
reintroduce them to honesty show em that they need more
the difference between the pretenders and the kendrick lamars
and so i took the fall
like the son of the lord on the cross
dyin for that fake shit you niggas bought
for the past decade
if i should pass please let this be my last essay
therefore i write from the heart
apologies to ogs for sacrificin my art
but im here for a greater purpose
i knew right from the start
im just a man of the people not above but equal
and for the greater good i walk amongst the evil
dont cry mama this the life i choose myself
just pray along the way that i dont lose myself
this is for the nigga that said that hiphop was dead
i went to hell to resurrect it
how could you fail to respect it

letting nas down i got the phone call
quietly i mourned dog i let nas down
yeah and on this flight
may i never lose sight fuck it

long live the idols may they never be your rivals
pac was like jesus nas wrote the bible
now what you just heards a tale of glory and sin
no id my mentor now let the story begin

a perfect smile is more appealing but its funny how
my shit is crookedlook at how far i done got without it
i keep my twisted grill just to show the kids its real

i got smart i got rich and i got bitches still
and they all look like my eyebrows thick as hell
love yourself girl or nobody will

with all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
i feel for you killin yourself to find a man thatll kill for you
you wake up put makeup on
stare in the mirror but its clear that you cant face whats wrong
no need to fix what god already put his paintbrush on
your roommate yelling why you gotta take so long
what its like to have a crooked smile

to all the women with the flaws know its hard my darling
you wonder why youre lonely and your mans not calling
you keep falling victim cause youre insecure
and when i tell you that youre beautiful you cant be sure
cause he dont seem to want you back and its got you askin
so all you see is what you lackin not what you packin
take it from a man that loves what you got
and baby girl you a star dont let em tell you youre not
now is it real eyebrows fingernails hair
is it real if its not girl you dont care
cause whats real is somethin that the eyes cant see
that the hands cant touch that them broads cant be
and thats you never let em see your frown
and if you need a friend to pick you up ill be around
and we can ride with the windows down the music loud
i can tell you aint laughed in a while
but i wanna see that crooked smile

even though i
on my way on my way on my way down
on my way on my way on my way down
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun know you know i find my way back round

we got the crooked smile we can style on em
back round crooked smile we can style on em
you were the one that was tryna keep me way down
but like the sun know you know i find my way back round

we dont look nothin like the people on the screen
you know the movie stars picture perfect beauty queens
but we got dreams and we got the right to chase em
look at the nation
thats a crooked smile braces couldnt even straighten

this is for the whole fucking ville i hope youre listening
smoking medical grade but i aint got prescription
all the way in cali where they aint got precipi
tation feeling like the only one that made it
and i hate it for my niggas cause they aint got ambition
fuck did you expect you can blame it on condition
blame it on crack you can blame it on the system
blame it on the fact that twelve got jurisdiction
to ride around in neighborhoods that they aint ever lived in
blame it on the strain that you feel when daddy missing
blame it on trump shit blame it on clinton
blame it on trap music and the politicians
or the fact that every black boy wanna be pippen
but they only got twelve slots on the pistons
blame it on the rain milli vanilli with the disk skip
what im tryna say is the blame can go deep as seas
just to blame em all i would need like twenty cds
theres all sorts of trauma from drama that children see
type of shit that normally would call for therapy
but you know just how it go in our community
keep that shit inside it dont matter how hard it be
fast forward them kids is grown and they blowing trees
and popping pills due to chronic anxiety
i been saw the problem but stay silent cause i aint jesus
this aint no trial if you desire go higher please
but fuck that now im older i love you cause you my friend
without the drugs i want you be comfortable in your skin
i know you so i know you still keep a lot of shit in
you running from yourself and you buying product again
i know you say it helps and no im not trying to offend
but i know depression and drug addiction dont blend
reality distorts and then you get lost in the wind
and i done seen the combo take niggas off the deep end
one thing about your demons they bound to catch up one day
id rather see you stand up and face them than run away
i understand this message is not the coolest to say
but if you down to try it i know of a better way

one thousand nine hundred and eightyfive i arrived
thirtythree years damn im grateful i survived
we wasnt sposed to get past twentyfive
jokes on you motherfucker we alive
all these niggas popping now is young
everybody say the music that they make is dumb
i remember i was eighteen
money pussy parties i was on the same thing
you gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
everybody talkin like they know somethin these days
niggas actin woke but they broke umm
i respect the struggle but you all frontin these days
man they barely old enough to drive
to tell them what they should do who the fuck am i
i heard one of em diss me im surprised
i aint trippin listen good to my reply
come here lil man let me talk with ya
see if i can paint for you the large picture
congrats cause you made it out your mamas house
i hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
i see your watch icy and your whip foreign
i got some good advice never quit tourin
cause thats the way we eat here in this rap game
im fuckin with your funky lil rap name
i hear your music and i know that raps changed
a bunch of folks would say that thats a bad thing
cause everythings commercial and its pop now
trap drums is the shit thats hot now
see ive been on a quest for the next wave
but never mind that was just a segue
i must say by your songs im unimpressed hey
but i love to see a black man get paid
and plus you havin fun and i respect that
but have you ever thought about your impact
these white kids love that you dont give a fuck
cause thats exactly whats expected when your skin black
they wanna see you dab they wanna see you pop a pill
they wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
and somewhere deep down fuck it i gotta keep it real
they wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
so when you turn up you see them turnin up too
you hit the next city collect your money when its due
you gettin that paper swimmin in bitches i dont blame you
you aint thinkin bout the people thats lookin like me and you
true you got better shit to do
you coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
i know you think this type of revenue is never endin
but i wanna take a minute just to tell you that aint true
one day them kids thats listening gon grow up
and get too old for that shit that made you blow up
now your shows lookin light cause they dont show up
which unfortunately means the money slow up
now you scramblin and hopin to get hot again
but you forgot you only popped cause you was ridin trends
now you old news and you goin through regrets
cause you never bought that house but you got a benz
and a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
and a bunch of fake friends i aint judgin you
im just tellin you whats probably gon happen when you rappin
bout the type of shit you rappin bout
its a faster route to the bottom
i wish you good luck
im hoping for your sake that you aint dumb as you look
but if its really true what people sayin
and you call yourself playin with my name
then i really know you fucked trust
ill be around forever cause my skills is tiptop
to any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
just remember what i told you when your shit flop
in five years you gon be on love  hiphop nigga


right right right right
somethings got a hold on me
right right right right
sometimes i think pain is just a lack of understanding
if we could only understand it all would we feel no pain
god must feel no pain
somethings got a hold on me
only joy
does this mean even our suffering pleases him

lost in a cloud of marijuana
young carolina nigga fish out of water
stepdaddy just had a daughter with another woman
mama aint recover yet
callin me at twelve at night
she drunk as fuck and im upset
cause why she always using me for crutch
growin up i used to always see her up
late as shit cigarette smoke and greatest hits from marvin gaye
she kill a whole bottle of some cheap chardonnay
i gotta leave this house cause part of me dies when i see her like this
too young to deal with pain
id rather run the streets than see her kill herself
so ville became my escape from a feelin i hate
mama cursing me out
depressions such a villainous state
i used to stay out later on purpose
subconsciously i was nervous that if i came home early then what would surface was her inner demons
and then id have to end up seein my hero on ground zero
tears flow while al green blow
love and happiness
i wish that i could say the right words to cheer her up
i wish her sons love was enough
i tell her mama go to sleep
she tell me boy hush you better pray to god you never get your heart crushed
i shake my head in frustration
head to my room and i can still hear the tunes with my door shut
fuck it though a couple more months ill be gone
off to college and dorms
foolin myself thinkin problems are gone
but now its one am and my mama dialin my phone
i know she intoxicated and soon this high that im on comes crashin down
she lit talkin drunk shit im pissed
but im still all ears like basset hounds
thinkin to myself maybe my mama need help
dont she got work in the morning
why she do this to herself
hate how she slurrin her words
soundin so fuckin absurd
this aint the woman i know why i just sit and observe
why dont i say how i feel
when i do shes defensive for real
well maybe things get better with time i heard it heals
little did i know how deep her sadness would go
lookin back i wish i woulda did more instead of runnin

somethings got a hold on me
i cant let it go
out of fear i wont be free
somethings got a hold on me
i cant let it go
out of fear i wont be
no
somethings got a hold on me
i cant let it go
right
life can bring much pain
there are many ways to deal with this pain right
choose wisely right


one night
when me and my mom was about to go to bed
all the doors was locked
then when i had fell asleep
my mom had heard three gun shots
it was to my cousin his name was rod
the one that came to pick me up
he had been shot right through the face right in the neck
and he got shot right in the stomach

i put my hand to the sky i sing
grateful for the blessings you bring
thank you for the ones i love
forgive me for the times i was
down and confused i know
what i reap is what i will sow
once again i find myself
back with you from my hell
all i ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
get some money plus respect and now look i got all of that
all i wanna do is see my granny on the other side
all i wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
all i wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
all i wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
all i wanna do is see my granny on the other side
all i wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry

right now im starin out the window of my range and contemplating am i sane
have i sacrificed for fame
my occupations on my brain
thought that i could change it all if i had change
but the niggas that i came up with way back is still the same
i be tryna give em game like santa did when christmas came
they be listenin but its clear to me they did not hear a thing
it go in one ear and out the other like a bullet out the muzzle of a pistol shot by brothers standin pointblank range
niggas bang in the ville i always thought that shit was strange
how you claim blood or cuz when that was just a la thing
i dont mean no disrespect towards your set no im just sayin
that it seem like for acceptance niggas will do anything
niggas will rep any gang niggas will bust any head
niggas will risk everything point him out and then he dead
shootin up where his granny live blaow blaow his granny duck
he dont give a fuck hes on henny and xannyd up
blowin tammy up bitch when you gon give them panties up
he gon plant a seed but best believe he aint man enough
just because yo dick can spray semen it dont mean that you ready to let go of yo childish ways
the results are deadly
because that child will suffer and thats what can most affect me
the little girl i met this past summer said dont forget me
i wont forget you how could i with all you went through
a bullet hit yo cousin in temple while he was with you
and while you was talkin i was tearin up wheres the tissue
if you was my sister then i would kiss you and tell you that im sorry for the pain you had to live through
i know im blessed because yo stress is realer than anything i done been through

i put my hand to the sky i sing
grateful for the blessings you bring
thank you for the ones i love
forgive me for the times i was
down and confused i know
what i reap is what i will sow
once again i find myself
back with you from my hell
all i ever wanted was to hear them bitches holler back
get some money plus respect and now look i got all of that
all i wanna do is see my granny on the other side
all i wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry
all i wanna do is touch a platinum plaque and celebrate
all i wanna do is keep my niggas out the yellow tape
all i wanna do is see my granny on the other side
all i wanna do is kill the man that made my momma cry

its not that big
well at least um
god had saved him cause he still alive
so why do yall think that bad stuff happen
like why cant the world just be all nice things
because god is tryna um
warnwarn us or teach us a lesson that we need to learn
or hes tryna warn us of hes comin back to um see us and take us home and redo the world
hes comin back to um have us be his children and for us to see him for the first time so we can rejoice with him and have our time
and after we do that hes gonna restart the world

foot is on they neck i got em stuck
ima give em somethin they can feel
if it aint bout the squad dont give a fuck
pistol in your hand dont make you real

money in your palm dont make you real
pistol in your hand dont make you real
money in your palm dont make you real


this is called being high as shit for hours
thats the name of this song nigga
high as shit for hours
here we go yeah

american hypocrisy oh let me count the ways
they came here seekin freedom
then they end up ownin slaves
justified it usin christianity which saves
religion dont mean shit theres too much ego in the way
thats why isis is a crisis
but in reality this country do the same shit
take a life and call it righteous
remember when bin laden got killed supposedly
in a hotel lobby after a show was noticin
these white ladies watchin cnn coverin the action
they read the headline and then they all started clappin
as if lebron had just scored a basket at the buzzer
i stood there for a second
watched them highfive each other
for real i thought this was thou shalt not kill
but police still lettin off on niggas in the ville
claimin that he reached for a gun
they really think we dumb and got a death wish
now somebodys son is layin breathless
when i was a little boy my father lived in texas
pulled up in toyota drove that bitch like it was lexus
put my bag in his trunk and headed off for dallas
out there for the summer feelin just like i was alice
lost in the wonderland where niggas still sufferin
just like they was back home and thats wrong
so now its fuck the government
they see my niggas strugglin
and they dont give a fuck at all and thats wrong yeah

the type of shit that make you wanna
the type of shit that make you wanna let go
the type of shit that make you wanna
the type of shit that make you wanna let go

i had a convo with the president i paid to go and see him
thinkin about the things i said id say when i would see him
feelin nervous sittin in a room full of white folks
thinkin about the black man plight think i might choke
nope raised my hand and asked a man a question
does he see the struggle of his brothers in oppression
and if so if you got all the power in the clout
as the president whats keepin you from helpin niggas out
well i didnt say nigga but you catch my drift
he looked me in my eyes and spoke and he was rather swift
he broke the issues down
and showed me he was wellaware
i got the vibe he was sincere and that the brother cared
but dawg you in the chair whats the hold up
he said theres things that i wanna fix
but you know this shit nigga politics
dont stop fightin and dont stop believin
you can make the world better
for your kids before you leave it
change is slow always has been always will be
but fuck that ima bust back til they kill me
change is slow always has been always will be
but fuck that ima bust back until they kill mefeel me

the type of shit that make you wanna aight third verse
the type of shit that make you wanna let go
the type of shit that make you wanna
the type of shit that make you wanna let go

heres a thought for my revolutionary heart
take a deeper look at history its there to pick apart
see the people at the top
they get to do just what they want
til after a while the people at the bottom finally get smart
then they start to holla revolution
tired of livin here destitution
fuck that lootin can you tell me whats the best solution
i used to think it was to overthrow oppressors see
if we destroy the system that means well have less of greed
but see its not that simple
i got to thinkin about the history of human nature
while this instrumental played
then i realized somethin that made
me wonder if revolution was really ever the way
before you trip and throw a fit over these words i say
think about this shit for a second you heard the way
the children in abusive households grow up
knockin girlfriends out coldthats called a cycle
abused becomes the abuser and thats just how life go
so understand
you get the power but you know what power does to man
corruption always leads us to the same shit again
so when you talk bout revolution
dawg i hear just what you sayin
what good is takin over
when we know what you gon do
the only real revolution happens right inside of you
i said what good is takin over
when we know what you gon do
the only real revolution happens right inside of you nigga

the type of shit that make you wanna
high for hours nigga
the type of shit that make you wanna let go volume one
the type of shit that make you wanna
the type of shit that make you wanna let go
