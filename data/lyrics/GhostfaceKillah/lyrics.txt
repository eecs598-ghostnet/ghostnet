if we leave a smart one in the ghetto he might develop into a leader against us

record spins im going in
i dont shoot to kill i play to win
stay catching up with the cutthroats
some men shoot a nigga throw em off the tugboat no floats
the body sinks to the bottom
or left off the side of the road to smell rotten
the murder sprees random killings
ghostface killahs back attacking villains hanging from the ceilings
godfather motives gangsta mentality
black superhero with the immortality
forever i be creeping in a black mist
ill night vision with the militant tactics
i glide through the air like a swarm of bees
shake niggas off quick like a dog with fleas
raw meat leave bodies slumped in the street
revenge is the spice of life its so sweet
ay yo pipe bombs blowing they souls to jesus
dont need nothing but the puzzle glue for the pieces
meat cleaver cut finger tips like rib tips
home invasions cars gonna flip delucas lose
pair of cement shoes tossed in the ocean
popped until they brain ooze i wont lose
blood all on my apron hog tie em up while they try escaping
peeped the visual tied em up individual
took their clothes off season em like sausage
let the pits out to eat em thats the remedy
attack kill bite off their extremities
blood bath splash my name on my wall
call it piece delivery leave a tip on the stall
with an arm leg a head im coming for you all


uhhuh its the sure shot yo yeah

heart of a lion king of the jungle
im a humble killer bee you as soft as a bumble
i dont crumble i strike back hard with a vengeance
attack through these killer words i spit in a sentence
im a menace the black clark kent caped crusader
the face of a ghost i disappear in the vapors
you could murder my flesh and bone souls invincible
revenge my death paybacks the main principal
protect ya neck when you move i be lurking in the shadows
starks the gangsta nigga i never lose battles
pimp bitches with a superhero logo on my chest
big gucci link gfk on the crest
icy arm for the eagle with the eight carat ruby eyes
piss on your motherfucking lawn while im stupid high
all black down royalty purple and some ice chips
two glock nines pointed at you in a hype flick

now im alone in the room and i just stare at the wall
revenge my death but im going through withdrawals
my lost niggas i miss them this new power and wisdom
got me thinking ive made a whole lot of bad decisions
got logan still to deal with should i kill her
throw her fuckin ass in a cage with a gorilla
or let her live and treat her like scum of the earth
ive got goons to feed and babies to birth
im the god now plus im a super rich nigga
do more help than harm either way you figure
should i protect and serve or cock and aim destruction
let the enterprise take over the force of production
corruption my mind state is unpredictable
im bulletproof now back from the dead im invincible


the delucas pressed tonys remains
into twelve vinyl records
one for each member of the family
but little did they know
he would return

medusa stare my guns bust in silence
im a black vigilante killer pro violence
its the rebirth born again rise through the vinyl spin
they took out starks but the light shines within
its the almighty rise of the murderous ghostface
bodies dropped in alleys left a cold case
colombian neckties im a black gambino
bodies get dumped in the black el camino
its reno gangster wars money power respect
revenge is felt like the heat from a tec
tommy guns are irrelevant im bulletproof now
i could fly through the air and duck your chickapow
black superhero crime boss arch nemesis
good vs evil since the first book of genesis
battle to the end thats the way of the thriller
and starks is reborn as the ghostface killah no one could get iller

murders bodies chopped into ziplocs
kill or be killed on these cobblestone street blocks
crime boss i call warn the delucas
watch my eyes turn red i got a squad full of shooters
murder murder kill kill kill
when the gas start to hum i put the spark to your grill

late night stuck in the limo
hogtie the capo all up beheaded the driver
left the bitch in the back with no tongue as the survivor
raw dog spit in her mouth
disappear in a swarm of killer bees
cripple em from they knees take they legs out nigga you know the steez
im a nighthawk eagle eye power of mind control
faster than the speed of light you catch a big hole
ruthless six bodies hung in the meat room
the butcher shop i call it the body shop
start from the bottom killing all the way to the top
carve my name in your skin pull a stocking mask over your face
for recognition no time for remission
attack till theres no one left in the position
the return of the worst case scenario
uh ghostface attacks on land and now aerial

murders bodies chopped into ziplocs
kill or be killed on these cobblestone street blocks
crime boss i call warn the delucas
watch my eyes turn red i got a squad full of shooters
murder murder kill kill kill
when the gas start to hum i put the spark to your grill


did you feel the wind this time
did you see the moon light shine
cause the twilight seems near
but the light shines nowhere
do you feel the cold winds blow
did you see the darkening glow
cause the twilight seems near
but the light shines no where

she was amazing carmela caramel complexion
and god brought it into my life as a suggestion

the earth to my sun moon and stars we added up
mathematically its like i had a bad habit b
she knew my lifestyle chick of a crime boss
she would hide my guns in the house then lie to the task force

we were crazy in love couldnt get enough of each other
the center of attraction we were made for one another

i leave em buried alive just like a fossil bone
body bags line the streets reporters reportin
mafia ties drugs and extortion
delucas vs starkiano headline the news
police pull war on crime theyre gonna lose
judges get kidnapped captains get decapitated
starks rise above all to be emancipated
black godfather families at war
drive bys and molotovs settle the score
butcher shops are filled with chopped up casualties
i made sure to keep guns in all my faculties
the streets run red when the bosses disrespect us
neglected i guarantee no mans protected
to each his own grab a gun off the shelf
cause in a warzone the call is every man for self

cause in a warzone the call is every man for self
cause in a warzone the call is every man for self

how you prepare for war grab your guns and your hardware
never close your eyes in the barber chair
the heart of a lion thats what got him here
bulletproof the car yo we outta here
fuck the delucas weve got shooters with submachines
bonecrushing niggas like a football team under a new regime
the old we throw it out spin back the hammer let the lord sort em out
keep your gun cocked at the whorehouse sip the brown liquor
while we move a quarter ounce pick the territories
move north or south the high power shine yours is watered down
im underground with the vest is on open up your head
now your flesh is torn never turn my back up at restaurants
put holes in your chest come test the don
fortyfive in my holster let me stretch my arms


so the delucas want tone nah not today

dont even kill em just make em feel a lot of pain
stake out his wife and his seed at the soccer game
greet em with open arms beat em with no regard
feed em two twothrees freeze em leave em with no resolve
make a lead on me repping for the territory
no stepping on me brethren thats a negatory
you want a war these men pop dangerous
taking all in a ten block radius
murder rate double triple cripple the strip
like it got hit with a couple of missiles
eight will fly through your door ill get in your crib
in a wig in a cable guy uniform
my shooters maneuver weve got deluca in the scope
moving close say the word tone dude is ghost


it was an evil day the sun glistened over the city
shined bright though the window and the eyes of my kitty
i was reluctant a ball in the pit of my gut
like the phone call i got was just to set me up
she wouldnt do that my love had love for the kid
so i slid on my wallows and bounced out the crib
hit the block about six somth shit got switched up
she pulled long inside and said jump in the truck
so i did we supposed to be gone for ziti
she made the wrong turn im like where you goin to sweetie
felt the heat on the back of my neck
did a mirror check i didnt know what to expect
i got knocked out and woke up in the melting pot
i heard the delucas laughin and then shit got hot
they said die tony starks you gon melt like a record
never to be remembered never to be respected

ay ay ayo hold up hold up they said what
who said what

rolling with logan i told him damn that broad
its no surprise why she would do this
word on the streets she had a side deal working for the delucas

the delucas wont stop without merking us out
we should catch em while they celebrating burst in the crowd
tony death shit is working me vexed
they saying deck chill its real and youre certainly next
thrown into boiling vinyl cant let it slide fool
i guess its just my time to die too
first find logan gotta make her talk

bitch laughing first thought was beat the bitch up
moseyed off gracefully new yorks most wanted cheeba hawk
seen the yellow brick road i stole the pastries

rawness title is hellbound
quick to reload around faces surround look astound

we split a fair one poconos money
gin rummy with glare spot the lame bidders ear
yo and taste a teaspoon three hundred goons stash balloons
locked in lab rooms hit with the glock stashed in grants tomb
clocked him like a patient his stocks fall hustle invasion
knowing now we copped the block off the chain tricolor
freezing in velour icicle galore
gas station light gleaming on the wall
cop wiseguy jams james bond vans

flower grabbed tiff his man with the sideburns hat fell off
we noticed ringworms he hid behind rich
callah hit the light switch young girls were trampled
in the measured pool pistol with mase and broke the handle
desperate crawlin to the door on all fours
shim kicked the jukebox the theme song rode in was its yours

priceless ropes lay around the god get tangled
woolly hair eyes fiery red feet made of brass
twelve men following me it be the god staff

son beaming wifey on the beach sipping zima
wu binos to latinos we love selena
overnight god schedules fedex

its a thin line between love and hate
dont keep thinking you can keep treating your woman bad
its a thin line between love and hate
she wont ever get mad
its a thin line yes it is yes it is between love and hate
shes gonna fool you one day
its a thin its a line thin line between love and hate between love and hate

the two waiters serving plates stood in a trance shivering
i carried out the damn mission thats loyalty
no regrets anything less will destroy the peace
a boss is a boss learn to respect royalty

soulless eyes my guys got a blind stare

my intuition told me play my position and stay loyal
you aint got to get your hands dirty ill do it for you
i grew up on the crime side the new york time side
and gave up on everything when my moms died
perfected my craft on rooftops and staircases
pulled robberies with no mask showing my bare face

got with a sick ass clique and went all out
gat for gat back to back we can brawl out
hundred deep run up in macys and aired em all out

thirtysix seasons im stuck back on the couch
like a potato i dont play though
im stone cold son these lames is built like playdoh
i seen micks body on the floor covered in sheets

no familiar faces son im dodging the game
i want a clean slate but these cops stay screwin
snatching me up off the block what am i doin
oh its officer dingle and his sidekick berry
driving me around the hood so i could worry
see how fucked up it is theres crackheads on every corner
kids in the schoolyard smoking marijuana
i aint feeling it this aint the way i left these blocks
and my names faded out like some old damn socks
i want respect these streets was my playground once
i was the mack across one hundred and tenth on these stunts
not once would a nigga test me or gets zesty
i would walk down the street and sneeze they all blessed me

been on the battlefield for a long long time
i can see life closing in on this old body of mine

yeah homie im the kingpin called future
make a killin in these buildings in the millions got em feeling like brewster
shit hot as fallujah kids grown now they cock rugers
welcome back to the sewers where new whips maneuver
no kids playing no safe and sound havens
theres tre pound cases on the playground pavement
no more dudes with twentytwos in their sneaker soles
kids tote shit that leave your body with a heap of holes
im that neighborhood blizzard flooding these streets with snow
heavy iron on the ready my shitll crease your clothes
keep a flock of sweetest hoes yeah i sleeps with those
little slum young keyshia coles with cheaper clothes
undercovers all around the gutter they creepin low
i stays ahead kid i toss bread like pizza dough
i keep the tef around my torso with the piece below
that bulldog short nose g be at peace with those you know


mama bear was a church woman pops skated off
i was impaired an introverted youngin a lot changed my course
from nowhere to my first onion then them cops came across flashed the badge took my stash told my little ass get lost
threw me off when my grind was prime time then
you could step on and stretch mines to a nine times ten
i was gone remembering though that fine lines thin
so i studied that chessboard and we were all blind men
dealers ran the streets but the ds ran them
i was a killer underneath but needed expansion
something to constitute being high in a coupe
the cries from my youth so i applied for the suit
salute to the enforcer call me officer now
supporter of paraphernalia i toss it around
the link to the cartel costs is down
its that denzel in training day shit caution my grounds


doctor x enter the crib worked on the kid
created a mask that allowed me to breathe
but couldnt extract the chemicals from my body
poisonous lethal doses comatosis
in and out of conscious drugs is ferocious
the mass released the gas that simmered the soul
so my adrenaline stays level not out of control
i been contaminated physically altered
got wrong for doing right my attitude salted
im bitter i clean up the community
fuck these new york city cops i dont need immunity

fuck nine hundred and eleven private doctor on speed dial
slid to the aisle fixed up the golden child
exquisite doctor his work of art
created a gas mask to save tony starks
fuck nine hundred and eleven private doctor on speed dial
slid to the aisle fixed up the golden child
exquisite doctor his work of art
created a gas mask to save tony starks

i specialize in telekinesis recognize the thesis
the leading expert on war and weaponized diseases
the brilliant doctor x no scientist is colder
the mask i made specifically protects you from ebola
its destruction is impossible totally irrelevant
the compounds are not found on the periodic table of elements
adamantium plus vibranium
the force field that builds will shield your cranium
if anyone would try to place the mask upon their face
the mask will rupture
its designed to match your molecular structure
plus the gold was to give it a touch of luster
to match the eagle bracelet and adjust to your repulsive thrusters
busta psychology the wallaby that adapts to the environment
thats chameleon technology
but i digress i must confess
the mask is unequivocally my best invention yet doctor x

fuck nine hundred and eleven private doctor on speed dial

and her brain is easy to pick like faulty locks
shes awfully hot asshole burning like tobasco
she used to be thick its like where the hell her ass go
started smoking weed and graduated to the pipe
thought that she could quit but her calculations wasnt right
infactuated with the life of dope fiends and crack pushers
prostituting for old pimps who mack hookers
putting dope in the cook searching for her vein
tracks all over her arms she never felt the pain
the monkey on her back is now a gorilla
fiending for a hit knowing one day its gon kill her
the clinic didnt help nope she just another young black woman
destroying her pretty image and her health
got me thinking to myself damn how could this happen
i seen her on the corner nodding off sniffin and scratching


she wakes up with an urge to get high
everyday the same routine needing a morning fix to get by
so she reaches for her purse grab the bag and the needle
tie a sock around her arm and start shooting up the diesel
having flashbacks screwing some dude up in his hatchback
the night before body still sore holding her ass crack
a regular john she met him through tom
she passed out with the syringe still stuck in her arm
dying a slow death oh she losing her damn mind
from the troubles of the world feeling cursed by mankind
uh caught up in a desperate rage was blessed with aids
lost her appetite hardly slept in days
now its too late praying to jesus she fucked around
with the wrong penis contaminated with diseases
two months pregnant carrying around her fetus
but they found her on broad in the dumpster behind the cleaners

they found him slumped over the wheel horn blowing
bullet holes showing property stolen motor still going
driving side door waves scoping the window is broken
glass back and shredded his grill his collar was soaking
he probably knew the killas cause they jinxed him with ease
cops hold the perimeter thirsty looking for leads
knocking on doors questioning tenants the lieutenant
was the first to arrive on the scene he knew he was finished
dewayne roberts knew him in college midtwenties
stopped being brolic va drivers license in his wallet
the last call on his mobile phone was back to home
sorry miss amonias son was found dead with two in his dome

this is why the world series of poker
is decided over a no limit poker tournament
players pros even cant handle the pressure of the game
they consider no limit the only pure game left

you gotta know how to play your cards have a mean poker face
and know an ace deuce can take out your pocket broads
this is no limit hold em you gotta know when to fold em
if you plan on staying on top
you cant lose what you dont push into the pot
you cant make much either if you a believer of luck
go all in if youre feeling your cards deep in your gut

your boy sandy brock was ill like kobe bryant with the ball

when marinating in the slums you gotta practice survival
now everybody wants to be next american idol
but these are more than just songs pressed up your vinyl
being rich is a poor mans dream and we all wanna shine
but we all cant green knahimean
being rich is a poor mans dream and we all wanna shine
but we all cant green

i grew up hard maybe you grew up harder

momma aint raised no fool they say we gotta save the children
but first we gotta save our spoons
i was taught not to waste my food
even if i didnt like it every scrap on my plate got chewed
either you ate or you didnt eat the memories are bitter sweet
used to get teased by my friends cuz i had bigger feet
i think about them jokes and laugh crack a smile
cuz as a child i never knew that being broke was bad
growing up i was close to my dad but that still didnt stop a nigga
from putting that coke in them bags
that was the past now im riding with the oak in the dash

thats why im still here persuing my goals baking that bread
in the bakery if i aint out doing no shows
i hit the block once in a blue and front with the crew
and show niggas a good time by getting drunk in the stud
some niggas find happiness with a blunt and a brew

its kinda hard trynna look beyond buildings and bricks
we cant condone broken homes when our children is sick
trynna survive off the cereal and milk from the wic
and all the good ones we got be getting killed in the mix

young tiger woods or the new arthur ashe of tennis

ayo kane found logan lamping at delucas
sitting with a little black boy she called him lucas he knew it
found himself the daughter of a kingpin
the ex of tony starks its a winwin
his seed the grief filled up in his eyes
he kidnapped them both for a scheme of revenge
pillow cases over their heads tossed in the benz
no friends no foes only evil to expose
lets make a video
tell lu i got his grandson and daughter
and i aint lookin for no ransom
i want revenge i want blood i want his head on a rug
i want him to watch me strangle his daughter
butcher his babies attack pits foamin out the mouth with rabies
meightys stuffed in his ass cause bodily harm
this is just the fuckin tip of the storm
tell him to come tell him we need to speak man to mush
as soon as he step in the buildingambush


at day break the delucas made their way through the main gate
quietest cougars chasing wild gang prey
they cut through the chained fence up through the five escape steps
they raided the kane gang 
the look on kanes face when he realized what was taken place
he was anticipating a payday but he was faced with a melee
he sprained to his feet but his legs wouldnt stay straight
afraid he reached for his piece bang bang bang bang
but wait as if on cue the deluca crew called out lucas
and began shooting unison maneuvering from each of the rooms in pursuit of kane
blew smoke and the cue dreamt irrefutable stench of mutilated flesh and the death of human beings
finally it was over
the delucas lowered their revolvers and put them back in their shoulder holsters
they shifted through the dead remains
the bedrooms and the entry way
where the hell is lester kane

now what is this that stands before me
underneath his black cloth coughing
its logan and her half breed offspring
i got the nod from kane that ill be enforcing
this cruel source of my arbitration
ominous calm with the calmest concentration
this job i take it with pride and consideration
with no problem i bring violence without wild provocation
im delivering deaths invitation
 elevation will be the compensation for the confrontation
the delucas get wiped out without complication
if something goes wrong and i have to
ill step back and shoot
im the actual monster no zipper on the back of my suit
my squad is biblical but its backed by the truth
got worse schizophrenia than jekyll and hyde do
the menace weapon thats been cast out of heaven
i hope the delucas dont realize theyve been lied to

kanes gang had no imply the delucas had staked out the vacated building for eight days
they knew about his way in the way out the makeshift escape route
the hidden staircase the way down to the basement in the safe house
where to find logan and her afraid child
in a dark corner where they were being held
they were blindfolded with taped mouths
no light or water arms and legs bound

but theres a double cross of course im hearing guns letting off from somewhere else
im ready to get involved with the revolving  warehouse all by myself
i dive underground finding rounds

i am delivering deaths invitation
i am delivering deaths invitation
i am delivering deaths invitation
i am delivering deaths invitation
i am delivering deaths invitation

black bugatti with gold spokes folks get heart attacks
sitting on the top of the glow money in garbage bags
washing up the restaurants nightclubs etcetera
pinky ring worth a small island i raise the bezel up
women on theyre night strolls turning tricks and they trained to go
nothin stoppin my function got coppers on the payroll

a resurrection morning
the light goes
the sacrifice
the glory of the ghost controls the soul

time to surrender your physical being
so i can hear touch and smell and start seeing
life as a precious gift given from god
so i can enjoy my seed and start healing these scars
take this knife and push it through your windpipe slowly
come on lester kane you better show me
you a man of your word fuck the criminal conduct
you gotta sacrifice your life or else your times up
he took the knife the look on his face got calmer
i watched him take his life like a suicide bomber

its time to go i made a promise and im a man of my word
fuck it im a g and my bond will never swerve
i dreamt about this time and this place and i swear ive seen it
now im facetoface with a death angel
thinking about the lies that i took with no strife
standing here holding a knife now im bout to take my own life
but its for a good reason
my spirit needs to be replenished so i offer my soul to be relinquished

lifeless his body left slumped in a chair
it was time to become one but my mind wasnt there
i wasnt sure if i wanted to walk this corrupt earth
smell sweat instead of fear give up my powers
be a simple man let alone a ruthless killer
crime boss syndicate another sinner
murderer take lives like mines was once taken
or leave my seed in this cold world my hearts aching

man up soldier no need to back it up now
im in a large space beauty queens feeding me grapes
jewels all thick and clusty
me the father and rusty
whats the matter talking about youre not sure anymore
did you lie to your brother kane or did i die in vain
you dont wanna be a sinner but sinning is in your veins
you a general love the life of running in the city
pretty women lots of money doing anything you want
think about it me and you as one force
theres no limit to where we can take it
time is ticking jump up in my corpse
and be true living king that you are you need to live again
so you can enjoy the fruits and shine like the stars
drink the finest wines and dine on exotic foods
help the people who never helped dropping a little jewels
son you hesitating  i didnt hesitate for you
when it was my time to go i cocked it and showed prove

a resurrection morning
the light goes
the sacrifice
the glory of the ghost controls the soul

twelve reasons to die ghostface killah

as thunder strikes and the clouds smother the full moon
the soul of tony starks son is cast into an abyss of fog
and the spirit of ghostface killah reascends into his body
becoming a human inferno of vengeful rage
logan screams in terror as she realizes her fate
the possessed boy begins stabbing her again again and again
now standing alone blade in his hand he grins at triumph
sighs the sweet taste of revenge
lester kane and tony starks were nothing more than kindred spirits
separated by time and space but bonded together by violence and death
a touch of fate brought these two souls together
but for one of them the ultimate price was paid
this is not the last well ever hear of tony starks
actuality this is a new beginning
tony starks was once a man and became a demon
but now lives again in the flesh and blood
of the ghostface killah

word to god once i get em i got em the moments priceless
decapitating heads like a journalist snatched with isis
i want revenge now
spotted one of delucas men at a restaurant
eating spaghetti drinking on dom pérignon
with two other goons laughing probably joking bout the murder
i calmly approach them with the burner
when they realized the real live g was about to serve em
sixty pieces blew through his jaw closing his curtains
now its total chaos the people running for they lives
the other cocksuckers tried reaching for their hammers
but they was slow on their draw so i blammed em
taking they tops off like a convertible drop burgundy phantom
they say the taste of revenge is sweet well let me see
prepare the table for a feast take a seat now lets eat

lasting helps out the grass and
smile when its morning time
last night i wrote three rhymes i woke up to see the sun shine
if god is my witness
in scriptures and pictures
the sun kiss scrumptious son its nutricious
it makes me wanna climb
take a bite out of shine
this little light of mine
yo the sun could never be pussy he always come out
hell sit right there even if you pull your gun out
he can never run out when the lights go out
its japans turn now the earth has spun around
i see yellow and green its a beautiful thing
the skys blue cos the sun hit the water like bing
a reflection uhhuh and thats all it is word
you cant stare at him long cos your facell do like this

look whos shining again

feeling the warm sun rays upon your back as you walk
the heatdriven a theory i plung to deep living is
souls have to go through the sun to reach heaven
and sensing retreat our souls badden the scene
madame believe since dinosaurs and adam and eve
that suns hovered to the extermination of us
its a peephole which leads to the firmament above us

who can take a raindrop and turn it to glee
and drawn up six miles over tropical isles and bring it to the sea

all that i got is you
and im so thankful i made it through

yo dwellin in the past flashbacks when i was young
whoever thought that id have a baby girl and three sons
im goin through this difficult stage i find it hard to believe
why my old earth had so many seeds
but shes her own woman due to me i respect that
i saw life for what its really worth and took a step back
family aint family no more we used to play ball
eggs after school eat grits cause we was poor
grab the pliers for the channel fix the hanger on the tv
rockin each others pants to school wasnt easy
we survived winters snotty nosed with no coats
we kept it real but the older brother still had jokes
sadly daddy left me at the age of six
i didnt know nuttin but mommy neatly packed his shit
she cried and grandma held the family down
i guess mommy wasnt strong enough she just went down
check it fifteen of us in a three bedroom apartment
roaches everywhere cousins and aunts was there
four in the bed two at the foot two at the head
i didnt like to sleep with jonjon he peed the bed
seven oclock pluckin roaches out the cereal box
some shared the same spoon watchin saturday cartoons
sugar water was our thing every meal was no frill
in the summer free lunch held us down like steel
and there was days i had to go to techs house with a note
stating gloria can i borrow some food im dead broke
so embarrasin i couldnt stand to knock on they door
my friends might be laughin i spent stamps in stores
mommy wheres the toilet paper use the newspaper
look ms rose gave us a couch shes the neighbor
things was deep my whole youth was sharper than cleats
two brothers with muscular dystrophy it killed me
but i remember this moms would lick her finger tips
to wipe the cold out my eye before school with her spit
case worker had her runnin back to face to face
i caught a case housin tried to throw us out of our place
sometimes i look up at the stars and analyze the sky
and ask myself was i meant to be here why
yeah yo

all that i got is you
and im so thankful i made it through
all that i got is you
and im so thankful i made it through
all that i got is you
and im so thankful i made it through
all that i got is you
and im so thankful i made it through
all that i got is you
and im so thankful i made it through

word up mommy i love you
word up
it was all you word you brought me in like this

i sit and think about
all the times we did without dad
i always said i woudnt cry
when i saw tears in your eyes
i understand that daddys not here now
but some way or somehow i will always be around yeah
all the things that i did from this to them
oh from drugs to being there
being down and out and i love you always

yeah you say
you see the universe which consists of the sun moon and star
and them planets that exist in my space
like man woman and child
you understand
we got to keep it real and what reality
and reality will keep it real with us
i remember them good ol days
because see thats the child i was
what made me the man i am today
see cause if you forget where you come from heheh
youre never gonna make it where youre goin aheh
because you lost the reality of yourself
so take one stroll through your mind
and see what you will find
and youll see a whole universe all over again
and again and again and again and again


i want you youve got to stop your storm babe xfour

and you bringing the music of the  wutang clan
and you hear ironman on your  radio rapping
your feet start the dancing and your  hands start the clapping

streets running through your dancehall gunning
like lee harvey oswald stunning slapping mcs with summons
for pumping  that watered down substance

i saw life for what its really worth and took a step back
family aint family no more we used to play ball
eggs after school eat grits cause we was poor
grab the pliers for the channel fix the hanger on the tv
rockin each others pants to school wasnt easy
we survived winters snotty nosed with no coats
we kept it real but the older brother still had jokes
sadly daddy left me at the age of six
i didnt know nuttin but mommy neatly packed his shit
she cried and grandma held the family down
i guess mommy wasnt strong enough she just went down
check it fifteen of us in a three bedroom apartment
roaches everywhere cousins and aunts was there
four in the bed two at the foot two at the head
i didnt like to sleep with jonjon he peed the bed
seven oclock pluckin roaches out the cereal box
some shared the same spoon watchin saturday cartoons
sugar water was our thing every meal was no frill
in the summer free lunch held us down like steel
and there was days i had to go to techs house with a note
stating gloria can i borrow some food im dead broke
so embarrasin i couldnt stand to knock on they door
my friends might be laughin i spent stamps in stores
mommy wheres the toilet paper use the newspaper
look ms rose gave us a couch shes the neighbor
things was deep my whole youth was sharper than cleats
two brothers with muscular dystrophy it killed me
but i remember this moms would lick her finger tips
to wipe the cold out my eye before school with her spit
case worker had her runnin back to face to face
i caught a case housin tried to throw us out of our place
sometimes i look up at the stars and analyze the sky
and ask myself was i meant to be here why

because you lost the reality of yourself
so take one stroll through your mind
and see what you will find
and youll see a whole universe all over again

underprivileged grew up in a stapleton house village
where blood flood the water in streets like oil spillage
my front door was blowing the debt man spotted fiftyfive boa

big niggas in they drawers pose one knee on the floor
little kids daydream of humping wildflower
hanna barbera fame geraldo rivera

fat ass whips big asses colorful lips
wide hips spoiler kits chrome dipped
wearing loot kicks
plus gs boomin beats
loud horn beeps crowded streets confusion yo
the heat is on yo its too black its too strong
in one hour wutang clan is about to perform
police barricade sidewalk crowded like parades
your arena now present the event of the decade
long braids and fades bald heads finger waves

friday just got great
headlining your marquee is the prime time rhyme crime family
and shines godly light upon this hiphop art form
yo dunn we cant be measured by no chart the god born
never bust premature for sure
you want it raw let me plant my dynamite bitch
deep inside your core
the explosion stops your menstruation
cause your stomach inflation
patiently wait nine months for deportation
of the earth from the moon black woman stay in tune
yo gods let me born yall the science about the womb
its a black hole for those who lose control
fertile soil for royal and wise
and spoiled many men and took many lives
loyal brothers changed sides
only birthed a decimal compared to those who died inside

golden arms is bronze buddha palm hit quran
it blows extreme mainstream be the theme supreme team
americas cream team redeemed
vidal sassoon chrome tones hear the moans of al capone
gun pow to the dome and split the bone
wig blown off the ledge by the alleged
fullfledged sledge rza edge
one dose of my feroc handheld trigger cuts
a capella spitting shell paralyse if you get touched
and critical mic cords hanging like umbilical
cords dope swords five star general
raw be the quote rap style sore throat
through the fully operational hand held tote mhm

yes the shit is raw coming at your door
start to scream out loud wutangs back for more

a hundred thousand times one snatch up my styles get done
i hold a title and heres how my belt was won check it
slick majestic broke mics are left infected
germs start to spread through your crew through lack of effort
you asked for it shot up the jams like syringes
my technique alone blows doors straight off the hinges
masked avenger i appear to blow your ear like wind
with a freestyle sharper than the indian spear
so sit back and let the king explore
describe me the kids nice and he holds swords
and his name black attacks the nerve like migraines
with more gains than beggars on trains livid sharp pains
poisonous rebel like deck you cant destroy this
you get ambushed skate try to avoid this
side effects of hot raps and hot tracks
a duffel bag full of guns son dipped in black
my culture glides and attacks you like a vulture
ghostface in madison square is on your poster

yes the shit is raw coming at your door
start to scream out loud wutangs back for more
yes the hours four i told you before
prepare for mic fights and plus the cold war

be on the lookout for this mass murderous suspect
that fills more body bags than apartments in projects
and as far as the coroners know
the autopsy show it was a shaolin blow
put on by my family brought to the academy
of the wu and learnt how to
fuck up your anatomy steadily calm and deadly
spatterhead lyrics i lick through your transmit
mcs submit to the will as i kill your
juvenile freestyle civilize the mental
devils worship this like an icon
bearhugging mics with the grips of a python

yes the shit is raw coming at your door
start to scream out loud wutangs back for more

you heard other raps before but kept waiting
for the son of song i keep dancehalls strong
beats never worthy of my cause i prolong
extravaganza time sits still
no propaganda be wary of the skill
as i bring forth the music make love to your eardrum
dedicated to rap nigga beware of the fearsome
lebanon don malcolm x beat threat
cd massacre murder to cassette
i blow the shop up you aint seen nothing yet
one man ran tryna get away from it
put your bifocal on watch me acometh
into your chamber like freddy enter dream
discombumberate your technique and your scheme
four course applause like a black dat to dat

nowhere to go except next show bro
entertaining motherfuckers cant stop o
in battling you dont want me to start tattling
all up on the stage cause yall snakes keep rattling

the fat lp with cappachino on the wax
pass it in your thing put valve up to twelve
put all the other lps back on the shelf
and smoke a blunt and dial nine hundred and seventeen
sixteen million fortynine thousand three hundred and eleven
and you could get long dick hiphop affection

plo style got thrown out the car
and ran over by the method man jeep

cause you weak in the knees like swv
tryna get a title like wu killa bee
kid change your habit you know im friends with the abbott

so what the fuck i got to lose ha word to god lets get it on
clap your heels three times grab the magic wand
nameless these stonewashed cats leave em brainless
somewhere out of this world stranded on uranus
with coke and a dollar bill stems and crack capsules
take a blast boo booby trap a cruise its natural
like soybean burn like a laser beam
my vaccine i shoot it firm and it connects like sideburns
the segment rap fragment comes together like magnets
attract heads captured like dragnet
going through mad phases of all ages
killa beez locked the fuck up behind cages
the genovese swallow this line and caught a freeze
press caller id for me to quote more degrees
the fortune teller tuck a sleeping gas umbrella
award winning dining in the back of armanbella
now who dont believe that cash must rule

heavy panting

its assassination day i stalk

i move through the third world my third eyes the guiding light
invite the fight we all die tonight
the life i lives a twentyfive to life bid
parole reneged i stroll the globe fugitive
cream is short cee cipher power stalk plus the fiend talk
three gs the cost in supreme court
white lies and blackmail land me back in jail
were all for sale a stolen goal but it fail
stranded on the front line i shine to the dumb and blind
it comes time i take back what was once mine
crunch time in the first quarter from the worst slaughter
devils poisoning the birth water
the earth daughter rest her head on my chest
through the struggle we cuddle under halfmoon crest
while the press plant fear and exploit the gun blasting
central broadcasting is shackling nerves are unfastened
trapped in deep water gasping
i clash with the titans for my half on the action

i stop producers careers the weak spot was the ears
scorpion darts hits the mark pierce the heart with silver spears
youre bewildered my unsaturated low filtered
devils still feel this so youre living build tilted
mcs upon their axis their body hazard tactic
lactic acid desert dry cactus practice
you can never match this invincible wutang indispensable
one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice
the mic is in my clutches
thugs who bring ruckus leave in crutches
unforgivable snakes face the doubleedged swords starts to swivel
decapitates the head makes the projects more livable
interchangeable caution flammable
my chamber is ninetynine plus one  unnameable angles
and strangles microphone cords start to dangle
silent as the gases that pass throughout your anal
we creep through your doors
seep out like sweat through the pores
destroy your internal organs with the biological warfare

first of all before we move on this shit is like a yukon don
spread it out like grey poupon
splurging merging in the suburbs
using this just like an adverb action word flowing like a blackbird
god came in aiming like terry bradshaw
he hit the crash bar stay relaxed god his shit is smashed pa
you handle this just like algebra ufo spot em like galaga
holding like bulletproof acuras
you so fly yeah right you want to get me high yo bobby
you hear how im shooting it like they blue tops
no you wont play me like your lady
pay me three hundred and eighty spit it at you like a baby final destination hades

wars extremely serious and it saddens me
to have to take things to deadly measures
and have you measured and shot for no pay
its assassination day i stalk my enemy like prey
tranqued by deceptional sounds that deceives
and lures mcs to the lair
with a miclike bait then awaits to be bitten by greed
temptation tempts my victim to proceed
forward ignorance wouldnt allow retreat
youd rather pursue death than admit defeat
now whos best to describe for what i specialize in
murderous rhyming constantly inclining
my mind spits with an enormous kickback
your brain then absorbs the impact
disorderly conduct from the crowd is the feedback

its assassination day i stalk

the melting pot boil gun shot drama soil
gamble when i scramble handle hot pots of oil
manhandle pain killing erect my hidden
streets made me potent put your ninetysix bid in
vampire curse disperse on each verse
swim in black water axe slaughter through my earth
youre hit by my element great wall of china
mountain peak holds the globe like vagina

finger rolling rhythm ride the horse one hand
golden eye spy vs spy guilty of suspicion

one gallon of wilding park hill profiling

im prepared to go to war for the battle of supremacy
theres nothing now to remedy this decision
the only thing left is the loyalty of the family
cause once we establish the power they gone turn sour
and use everything in their power to shut us down
weve come to far to turn around tone

flew his private jet from rome to talk business
he heard about your crime saga poems looking to invest millions
its up to you tone this move can make us both rich
the crew is armed cocked and ready to rock steady
its nonstop hustling flow of their own casino rza tarantino
its wu gambino for life you know how we go
and to the last breath blow mi amigo


born into a world with violence death and destruction surrounding him at every turn tony starks took control of his own destiny and aspired to become one of the foremost leaders of the criminal underworld regardless of his will and the ability to run the streets with invincibility there were still those who chose to stand in his way


the slums of a big town as packed with drama and danger as the squalling street of some native quarter in the heart of this melting pot of crime stands an oasis where one man struggles against the forces that turned his loved one to lives of violence and shame

he spares no one
he was forgotten but he was someone
so beware of the stare of the ghostface killah
so beware of the stare of the ghostface killah

beware son i got the stare of medusa

ghostface killah lets see whos gonna survive

he spares no one
hes not forgotten cause he was someone

yo look away dont stare into the eyes of a killer
metal lungies junkies nigga i pack the nine millers and thrillers
bulletproof robes and wave caps
revenge mode nigga you know ghost gon stay strapped
hunt em down in alphabetical order
each person that crossed me watch the man slaughter
the butcher the baker the torturer the taker
imma send you right back to your maker
a few extra holes miss your soul sold to the devil
its the rebirth of slick brought back as a rebel
im immortal gonna kill generations of your fam
you tried to loathe my legacy away but i stand stronger
gfk the pain prolonger

he was a lonely man they killed him
cause they didnt understand
though his spirit possesses a rhythm
as the words on this record unleashes the ghostface killah


did you feel the wind this time
did you see the moon light shine
cause the twilight seems near
but the light shines nowhere
do you feel the cold winds blow
did you see the darkening glow
cause the twilight seems near
but the light shines no where

she was amazing carmela caramel complexion
and god brought it into my life as a suggestion

the finer things in life together we shared drinks

she was a jelly to my peanuts mars to venus
the earth to my sun moon and stars we added up
mathematically its like i had a bad habit b
she knew my lifestyle chick of a crime boss
she would hide my guns in the house then lie to the task force
finished my sentences knew my exact frame of mind
knew everything i had was hers and she was mine
we were crazy in love couldnt get enough of each other
the center of attraction we were made for one another

nah dont even fall for that caucasoid
she got your drink laced trying to turn you into an android
shes not your peanut butter more like a fucking nutcase

it was an evil day the sun glistened over the city
shined bright though the window and the eyes of my kitty
i was reluctant a ball in the pit of my gut
like the phone call i got was just to set me up
she wouldnt do that my love had love for the kid
so i slid on my wallows and bounced out the crib
hit the block about six somth shit got switched up
she pulled long inside and said jump in the truck
so i did we supposed to be gone for ziti
she made the wrong turn im like where you goin to sweetie
felt the heat on the back of my neck
did a mirror check i didnt know what to expect
i got knocked out and woke up in the melting pot
i heard the delucas laughin and then shit got hot
they said die tony starks you gon melt like a record
never to be remembered never to be respected

ay ay ayo hold up hold up they said what
who said what

rolling with logan i told him damn that broad
its no surprise why she would do this
word on the streets she had a side deal working for the delucas

the delucas wont stop without merking us out
we should catch em while they celebrating burst in the crowd
tony death shit is working me vexed

thrown into boiling vinyl cant let it slide fool
i guess its just my time to die too

but first tell your boss that he will get his

and i told him bout that chick
shit got me heated man
crazy gonna kill someone
still gon pay somebody gon pay


i formed a crew niggas straight tell me im slipping
im the boss of the fam i need to watch my position
bitches are sneaky trifling and not to be trusted
a weak link in the team and the chain will get busted
dont trust her love is for suckers
too many enemies is out there son tryna bring the ruckus
keep a tight circle dont let her rain on your parade
keep doing what were doing getting money and getting paid

enemies all around me one mistake and theyll down me
they just wanna rain on my parade
i said the enemies all around you one mistake and theyll down you
they just wanna rain on your parade

its mindboggling the heart wants it the mind rejects it
fuck the past lets put the present in perspective
thats my lady she would never backstab or cross me
stand buttnaked in the storm sipping the frosty
you force me to choose ima follow my heart
she was there from the beginning but i tore em apart
no more delucas straight killa bee on the swarm
and when its time to get big she put her game face on


the delucas pressed tonys remains
into twelve vinyl records
one for each member of the family
but little did they know
he would return

medusa stare my guns bust in silence
im a black vigilante killer pro violence
its the rebirth born again rise through the vinyl spin
they took out starks but the light shines within
its the almighty rise of the murderous ghostface
bodies dropped in alleys left a cold case
colombian neckties im a black gambino
bodies get dumped in the black el camino
its reno gangster wars money power respect
revenge is felt like the heat from a tec
tommy guns are irrelevant im bulletproof now
i could fly through the air and duck your chickapow
black superhero crime boss arch nemesis
good vs evil since the first book of genesis
battle to the end thats the way of the thriller
and starks is reborn as the ghostface killah no one could get iller

murders bodies chopped into ziplocs
kill or be killed on these cobblestone street blocks
crime boss i call warn the delucas
watch my eyes turn red i got a squad full of shooters
murder murder kill kill kill
when the gas start to hum i put the spark to your grill

late night stuck in the limo
hogtie the capo all up beheaded the driver
left the bitch in the back with no tongue as the survivor
raw dog spit in her mouth
disappear in a swarm of killer bees
cripple em from they knees take they legs out nigga you know the steez
im a nighthawk eagle eye power of mind control
faster than the speed of light you catch a big hole
ruthless six bodies hung in the meat room
the butcher shop i call it the body shop
start from the bottom killing all the way to the top
carve my name in your skin pull a stocking mask over your face
for recognition no time for remission
attack till theres no one left in the position
the return of the worst case scenario
uh ghostface attacks on land and now aerial

murders bodies chopped into ziplocs
kill or be killed on these cobblestone street blocks
crime boss i call warn the delucas
watch my eyes turn red i got a squad full of shooters
murder murder kill kill kill
when the gas start to hum i put the spark to your grill


yeah yo theres a dozen ways to die six million ways to do it
lets go through it my mind flow like fluid
torture chop your legs up thrown off the boat
guillotine nigga one chop to the throat
suffocation saran wrapping your face
buried alive throw a few nails in the case
manslaughter eight degrees of separation
leave your body chopped up in a piece thats mutilation

six million ways to die cyanide in your drink
catch a cuban necktie for your mink
dahmer style cut up and stuffed in the fridge
and maybe washed up ashore and found under the bridge
hit him with the whip drag him half a block
machete or the sock full of padlocks
chainsaw switch your medication
stomp a nigga out til he one with the pavement

torture hes gruely peaking at the meeting
suspicions of him being a rat even worse than cheating
im cold reaking of ice picks scratch and sticks and closed fists
brassknuckle steel toe kicks
cracked ribs punctured lungs hard breathing
hes gasping and wheezing for air his breath he cant catch
he clinches the shirt on his chest
in a dying effort to reveal his last will before he was killed

first things first i chop your head to your fingertips
butcher knife your torso chop up your ligaments
make sure its legitimate conceal all my fingerprints
chop chop your body up quick then get rid of it
a hole in the desert body bag just polluted it
your miss was a snitch too shotgun killed the bitch
leave her in the wilderness suffocated and scarred up
your brother want more too blow his fucking car up

another homocide city murder mystery efficiently
delete your fucking history broke bone missing teeth
throw bones its slippery brings on the triple beam
all topped and chopped up mop buckets of mr clean
clorax and bissell steam sterilized the whole scene
photograph your death so i can spread it to your whole team
wont leave a trace of evidence for the case
its sinister to finish it hit with the man with no face

red wine and pink veal
unknowing that this would be his last meal
comfortable hes made to feel six inch stiletto heel
kept his refills filled
titties like big ass kept him still for the real deal
hitman from brooklyn tommy gun specialist
our one accomplice sipped courvoisier at the bar
then waited till she lit a cigar
then sprayed
in shattered wine glass he lay he never saw it coming

yo murder one bullets went fast through the flesh
i cocked the sawed off shotty put a hole in your chest
blow your lungs out ive seen you been smoking for years
you got no heart ill hunt you down like cape fear
push your brains out the back of your head blow off your hands
leave your body in a dumpster head in the trashcan
cell catching scene look clean as a whistle
ghost carved through your skin tissue til the bone grizzle


young aggressor born into the life of crime
i would walk down the street strapped with two nines
bitch smacking jacking niggas g dub stacking figures
police drive by i was clickclacking triggers
jay de lucas put me with the fam to grow
i was a boss amongst white boys rocking the fro
i had hoes bankrolls and minks by the dozen
my rise to power was quick they just wasnt
tryna make me a made man they fucked up the game plan
i blacked out on them and started my own clan
black gambino black suits the black syndicate
my crime fam was tight every move was intricate
the coke was brought in from bad colombian mules
gorgeous women that i draped down in jewels
streets fight started mafia wars in italy
crime fam against fam and no one could do diddly

do the dirty work bring in the coke by the boatloads
go against the grain nigga i feed nose holes
follow no family rules rules are for fools
chase the paper cause its the cash that rules

fuck the law of the fam its the law of the land
you dont like how i move then try to force my hand
im moving keys them delucas couldnt touch my pianos
putting pressure on them gambinis and verrazanos
they love my money they hate to see a nigga getting it
selling drugs is taboo but i aint fucking sweating it
the dirt gotta get done so i took my position
one day im just black tone with a lot of ambition
next i got status dinners with all courses
flights in and out of the country they getting nauseous
money power respect rise of the black suits
talk shit behind my back but to my face salute
hugs and handshakes they cant stop my reign
got the coconut pilots bringing shit on their plane
its a shame they aint have the balls to make moves
they pussies couldnt walk a mile in my shoes

do the dirty work bring in the coke by the boatloads
go against the grain nigga i feed nose holes
follow no family rules rules are for fools
chase the paper cause its the cash that rules
do the dirty work bring in the coke by the boatloads
go against the grain nigga i feed nose holes
follow no family rules rules are for fools
chase the paper cause its the cash that rules


record spins im going in
i dont shoot to kill i play to win
stay catching up with the cutthroats
some men shoot a nigga throw em off the tugboat no floats
the body sinks to the bottom
or left off the side of the road to smell rotten
the murder sprees random killings
ghostface killahs back attacking villains hanging from the ceilings
godfather motives gangsta mentality
black superhero with the immortality
forever i be creeping in a black mist
ill night vision with the militant tactics
i glide through the air like a swarm of bees
shake niggas off quick like a dog with fleas
raw meat leave bodies slumped in the street
revenge is the spice of life its so sweet
ay yo pipe bombs blowing they souls to jesus
dont need nothing but the puzzle glue for the pieces
meat cleaver cut finger tips like rib tips
home invasions cars gonna flip delucas lose
pair of cement shoes tossed in the ocean
popped until they brain ooze i wont lose
blood all on my apron hog tie em up while they try escaping
peeped the visual tied em up individual
took their clothes off season em like sausage
let the pits out to eat em thats the remedy
attack kill bite off their extremities
blood bath splash my name on my wall
call it piece delivery leave a tip on the stall
with an arm leg a head
im coming for you all

its the sure shot
heart of a lion king of the jungle
im a humble killer bee you as soft as a bumble
i dont crumble i strike back hard with a vengeance
attack through these killer words i spit in a sentence
im a menace the black clark kent caped crusader
the face of a ghost i disappear in the vapors
you could murder my flesh and bone souls invincible
revenge my death paybacks the main principal
protect ya neck when you move i be lurking in the shadows
starks the gangsta nigga i never lose battles
pimp nigga with a superhero logo on my chest
big gucci link gfk on the crest
icy arm for the eagle with the eight carat ruby eyes
piss on your motherfucking arm while im stupid high
all black down royalty purple and some ice chips
two glock nines pointed at you in a hype flick

now im alone in the room and i just stare at the wall
revenge my death but im going through withdrawals
my lost niggas i miss them this new power and wisdom
got me thinking ive made a whole lot of bad decisions
got locals still to deal with should i kill her
throw her fuckin ass in a cage with a gorilla
or let her live and treat her like scum of the earth
ive got goons to feed and babies to birth
im the god now plus im a super rich nigga
do more help than harm either way you figure
should i protect and serve or cock and aim destruction
let the enterprise take over the force of production
corruption my mind state is unpredictable
im bulletproof now back from the dead im invincible


roads of glory praising me the same
winds of fury cycle in the rain
cycle in the rain with the span of time
through the frame of mind the winds remind
roads of glory praising me the same
winds of fury cycle in the rain
cycle in the rain with the span of time
through the frame of mind the winds remind
if any body knew that time would
sit to show me in the time would never start anew
if any body knew that time would
sit to show me in the time would never start anew

ayo revenge is sweet thats why i take my time with it
like good pussy i just stay when im up in it

my plots are like movie scripts they well planned
snatch you off the land and drop you off in the sahara sand
so dont scam me dont try to double cross me
my tennessee goonsll nail that ass to the cross b
revenge mode i live life by the sword
and if you live by it die by it ill still kill your horse
set me up coming back like a thief in the night
ill have a suicide bomber pop up on your flight
you couldnt take my life my mask done resurrected
and im ghostface killah way more than you expected

those who fear his return
must face the catastrophe

yes but what they didnt expect a hundred ghouls
from the projects armed and masked with flamethrowers
and gasll blast anything hung him by his tongue ring
til he gave the info on how we find his kinfolk
made him sign the ransom then gave the note to his grandson
bust the shot and made him run fast
back to his family news of his discovery
would set off a chain of events that would
then lead to members of delucas to bleed with no exception
they sip the raw mussles so kill everything
no exception to the media
there would not be a retire or cease fire til every luca has expired
in entirety wishes of the god
tone starks to eternity respectfully

cutthroats murdersprees and killings were synonymous with his gangsta life before his passing so itda only seem fitting that it would become the embodiment of his new life

i keep having flashbacks of blasting at you bastards cutting outside the benches
got convicted of the gun charge and laughed at my sentence
four years five flat postrelease supervision
for niggas spitting in the wind but thats what i get for missing
so soon as i hit the bridge again niggas is finished
ninja mode on a mission out to end your existence
think im sitting up in prison
with a tin of l in a cell sick ass hell listen
everyday is like christmas i miss my seed and my missus
but i see em on visits i aint stressing over pussy
beat my dick to her pictures
when they free me imma see you leave you food for the fishes
hope the luca crew is in for the fixing
now get the henchman line em up
tommy gun em down the muzzle extension
tear they flesh off if one of em flinching

those who fear his return must face the catastrophe
the catastrophe
those who fear his return must face the catastrophe
the catastrophe
the catastrophe

talking bout the angels and peeps in somali
try to stay humble and swallow my pride
in god i trust not talkin bout the ones on your five
crisp dollar billing catch me in a little hut in benin
village style feeding the children
big pots of jasmine tea with mandela
africans chanting me on like coachella
ghostface bumaye kumbaya my lord
my death day twentyfour karat tomb i lay
wishing they could bury me next to the prophets
nabi lut isa musa hadrat muhammad ibrahim

am i a good man i dont know
am i a fool well see

the lord takes me gathering speeds before winds
high currents distance places be forming wings
kings offering thrones was there
man with the seven crowns on his dome was near
feet walked over rose petals sold from the ghetto
face froze in gold like the pharaoh
adorned in glory robe of light a power for his cherub
as he passed the path white doves crossed the eyes of thugs
eternal heartbeat and the dark fire in his blood
seven hundred books were opened
embraced to write then threw the crooks in the ocean
skin brass hair like it grew from goatskin
the chosen has spoken tablets were broken
the smoke hand grabs an omen
gravity grabbing me gradually dragging me through hells cavity
this is blasphemy i fell where the jackals feed
god felt bad for me but cast me in the caspian sea
satan gave the dragon his key wufamilys the faculty
kp kp

am i a good man am i a fool
am i

he used to sling in the stairwell
fast to put the rap on a thinking cap ignite your hair gel
no such thing as the fair sale
hell put the bullet out same day delivery airmail
and on this level a thug will sell your garbage
no refund the only exchange from the cartridge
but the users just kept coming back with their life earnings
ready to make a deal soul and pipe burning
the outcome tragic the household dramatic
living rooms for heating spoons basements for addicts
support from a bean hit the courts from a fiend
who betrayed one who had lit the torch for his team
so he sent them gifts body parts per diem
in a box that held prints but too dark to see em
