i met her at this house party on el segundo and central
she had the credentials of strippers in atlanta
ass came with a hump from the jump she was a camel
i want to ride like arabians push an four mercedesbenz
hello my name is kendrick she said no youre handsome
whispered in my ear disappeared then found her dancin
ciara had played in the background
the parade music we made had us all wearin shades now

she said down the street from dominguez high
okay i know thats borderline compton or paramount
well is it compton  no she replied
and quickly start battin her eyes
and strictly had wanted her thighs around me
seventeen with nothin but pussy stuck on my mental
my motive was rather sinful
what you tryin to get into
she didnt tell just gave me her nextel
dropped the number we chirped the whole summer and well

the summer had passed and now im likin her
conversation we havin probably enticin her
who could imagine maybe my actions will end up wifin her
love or lust regardless well fuck cause the trife in us
its deeprooted the music of bein young and dumb
is never muted in fact its much louder where im from
we know a lot bout each other her mother was a crack addict
she live with her granny and her younger two brothers

i was in heat like a cactus my tactics of bein thirsty
probably could hurt me but fuck it i got some heart

so now im down rosecrans in a caravan
passin alameda my gas meter in need of a pump
i got enough to get me through the traffic jam
at least i hope cause my pockets broke as a promise man
im thinkin about that sex thinkin about her thighs
or maybe kissin on her neck or maybe what positions next
sent a picture of her titties blowin up my texts
i looked at em and almost ran my front bumper into corvette
enthused by the touch of a woman shes a masseuse
and im a professional porn star when off the goose
i had a fifth in the trunk like curtis jackson for ransom
im hopin to get her loose like an uncle luke anthem
im two blocks away two hundred and fifty feet
and six steps from where she stay she wavin me cross the street
i pulled up a smile on my face and then i see

and your plans only can pan around love
you love him you love them you love her
you love so much you love when love hurts
you love red bottom and gold that say queen
you love handbag on the waist of your jean
you love french tip and trip that pay for
you love bank slip that tell you we paid more
you love a good hand whenever the card dealt
but what love got to do with it when you dont love yourself

i do what i wanna do
i say what i wanna say when i feel and i

the reason why i know you very well
cause we have the same eyes cant you tell
the days i tried to cover up and conceal
my pride it only made it harder for me to deal
when living in a world that come with plan b
a scapegoat cause plan a dont come free
and plan c just an excuse like because
or the word but but what if i got love
i love them i love when i love her
i love so much i love when love hurts
i love first verse cause youre the girl i attract
i love second verse cause youre the homie that pack
burner like a stove top that love cooking from scratch
i love what the both of you have to offer
in fact i love it so much i dont love anything else
but what love got to do with it when i dont love myself
to the point i should hate everything i do love
should i hate living my life inside the club
should i hate her for watching me for that reason
should i hate him for telling me that im seizin
should i hate them for telling me ball out
should i hate street credibility im talkin about
hating all money power respect in my will

uh warriors and conans hope euphoria can slow dance
with society the driver seat the first one to get killed

at the same burger stand where beep hang out
now this is not a tape recorder sayin that he did it
but ever since that day i was lookin at him different
that was back when i was nine joey packed the nine
pakistan on every porch is fine we adapt to crime
pack a van with four guns at a time
with the sliding door fuck is up
fuck you shootin for if you aint walkin up you fuckin punk
pickin up the fuckin pump pickin off you suckers
suck a dick or die or sucker punch
a wall of bullets comin from aks ars ayy yallduck
thats what momma said when we was eatin that free lunch

now crawl your head in that noose
you wind up dead on the news

obviously the coroner between the sheets like the isleys
when you hop on that trolley make sure your colors correct
make sure youre corporate or theyll be callin your mother collect
they say the governor collect all of our taxes except
when we in traffic and tragic happens that shit aint no threat

sleepin in the living room of my mommas pad
reality struck i seen the white car crash
hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
my pops said i needed a job i thought i believed him
security guard for a month and ended up leavin
in fact i got fired cause i was inspired by all of my friends
to stage a robbery the third saturday i clocked in
projects tore up gang signs get thrown up
cocaine laced in marijuana
and they wonder why i rarely smoke now
imagine if your first blunt had you foamin at the mouth
i was straight tweakin the next weekend we broke even
i made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin
you know the reasons but still will never know my life
kendrick aka comptons human sacrifice

gyeah cocaine weed
niggas been mixin shit since the eightys loc
sherm sticks buttnakeds
dip make a nigga flip
cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
one times crooked and shit
block a nigga in
alondra rosecrans bullis its compton

im still in the hood loc yeah thats cool
shit the hood took me under so i follow the rules
but yeah thats like me i grew up in the hood where they bang
and niggas that rep colors is doin the same thang
pass it to the left so i can smoke on me
a couple drivebys in the hood lately shit
couple of ivs with the fuckin spraycan
shots in the crowd then everybody ran

shots hit the enemy hearts turn brave
mount up regulators in the whip
down the boulevard with the pistol grip yeah
trip we in the hood still
so loc grab a strap cause yeah its so real yeah
deal with the outcome a strap in the hand
and a bird and ten grands where a mothafucka stand

if i told you i killed a nigga at sixteen would you believe me
or see me to be innocent kendrick you seen in the street
with a basketball and some now and laters to eat
if i mentioned all of my skeletons would you jump in the seat
would you say my intelligence now is great relief
and its safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
with dreams of bein a lawyer or doctor
instead of boy with a chopper that hold the culdesac hostage
kill em all if they gossip
the children of the corn they vandalizin the option
of livin a lie drown their body with toxins
constantly drinkin and drive
hit the powder then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
listen coward the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
out that bitch with deposit a price on his head the tithes
probably go to the projects i
live inside the belly of the rough compton usa

promise that you will sing about me

i woke up this morning and figured id call you
in case im not here tomorrow
im hopin that i can borrow
a peace of mind im behind on whats really important
my mind is really distorted
i find nothing but trouble in my life
im fortunate you believe in a dream
this orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
and last night was just another distraction
or a reaction of what we consider madness
i know exactly what happened
you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
but the type of bullet that stuck
had went against his will thats blood spilled on your hands
my plans rather vindictive
everybodys a victim in my eyes
when i ride its a murderous rhythm
and outside became pitch black
a demon glued to my back whispering get em
i got em and i aint give a fuck
that same mentality i told my brother not to duck
in actuality its a trip how we trip off of colors
i wonder if ill ever discover a passion like you and recover
the life that i knew as a youngin
in pajamas and duntaduns
when thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
dumb niggas like me never prosper
prognosis of a problem child im proud and welldevoted
this piru shit been in me forever
so forever ima push it wherever whenever
and i love you cause you love my brother like you did
just promise me youll tell this story when you make it big
and if i die before your album drop i hope 

promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off and its my turn
to settle down my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me

you wrote a song about my sister on your tape
and called it sectioneighty
the message resembled brendas got a baby
whats crazy was i was hearin about it
but doubted your ignorance
how could you ever just put her on blast and shit
judgin her past and shit
well its completely my future
her nigga behind me right now askin for ass and shit
and ima need that forty dollars
even if i got to fuck suck and swallow
in the parking lot gonzales park im followed
by a married man and father of three
my titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin keys
matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with es
he got a cousin named david and i seen him last week
this is the life of another girl damaged by the system
these foster homes i run away and never do miss em
see my hormones just run away and if i can get em
back to where they used to be then ill probably be in the denim
of a family gene that show women how to be woman
or better yet a leader you need her to learn somethin
then you probably need to beat her thats how i was taught
three niggas in one room first time i was tossed
and im exhausted but fuck that sorry for your loss shit
my sister died in vain but what point are you tryna gain
if you cant fit the pumps i walk in
ill wait your rebuttal a little too late
and if you have a album date just make sure im not in the song
cause i dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own
and matter fact did i mention that i physically feel great
a doctors approval is a waste of time i know im straight
ill probably live longer than you and never fade away
ill never fade away ill never fade away i know my fate
and im on the grind for this cake ima get it or die tryin
im eyein every male gender with intentions of buyin
you lyin to these motherfuckers
talkin about you can help em with my story
you can help me if you sell this pussy for me nigga
dont ignore me nigga fuck your glory nigga you aint shit

when the lights shut off and its my turn
to settle down my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off and its my turn
to settle down my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me

sometimes i look in the mirror
and ask myself am i really scared of passin away
if its today i hope i hear a
cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
with the holy ghost til it drown in the blood of jesus
i wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin
the scent of a reaper ensurin that my allegiance
with the other side may come soon and if im doomed
may the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
i suffer a lot
and every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
i tie my stomach in knots
and im not sure why im infatuated with death
my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful
and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
maybe cause im a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
really stuck in the schema of wonderin when ima rest
and youre right your brother was a brother to me
and your sisters situation was the one that pulled me
in a direction to speak on somethin
thats realer than the tv screen
by any means wasnt tryin to offend or come between
her personal life i was like it need to be told
cursin the life of twenty generations after her soul
exactly whatd happen if i aint continue rappin
or steady bein distracted by money drugs and fourfives
i count lives all on these songs
look at the weak and cry pray one day youll be strong
fightin for your rights even when youre wrong
and hope that at least one of you sing about me when im gone

mass hallucination baby
ill education baby
want to reconnect with your elations
this is your station baby

look inside these walls and you see im havin withdrawals
of a prisoner on his way
trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
track attire just tell you im tired and ran away
i should ask a choir what do you require
to sing a song that acquire me to have faith
as the record spin i should pray
for the record i recognize that im easily prey
i got ate alive yesterday
i got animosity buildin its probly big as a buildin
me jumpin off of the roof is me just playin it safe
but what am i posed to do when the topic is red or blue
and you understand that i aint
but know im accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble
and live in the street with rank
no better picture to paint than me walkin from bible study
and called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
from a function that tooken place they was wonderin if i bang
step on my neck and get blood on your nike checks
i dont mind cause one day youll respect
the good kid maad city

mass hallucination baby
ill education baby
want to reconnect with your elations
this is your station baby

all i see is strobe lights blindin me in my hindsight
findin me by myself promise me you can help
in all honesty i got time to be copacetic until
you had finally made decision to hold me against my will
it was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
i can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
every time you clock in the morning i feel you just want to kill
all my innocence while ignorin my purpose to persevere
as a better person i know you heard this and probably in fear
but what am i posed to do when the blinkin of red and blue
flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
and you ask lift up your shirt because you wonder if a tattoo
of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
gang files but that dont matter because the matter is racial profile
i heard em chatter hes probly young but i know that hes down
step on his neck as hard as your bulletproof vest
he dont mind he know well never respect
the good kid maad city

mass hallucination baby
ill education baby
want to reconnect with your elations
this is your station baby

all i see in this room twentys xannies and these shrooms
grownup candy for pain can we live in a sane
society its entirely stressful upon my brain
you hired me as a victim i quietly hope for change
when violence is the rhythm inspired me to obtain
the silence in this room with twentys xannies and shrooms
some grownup candy i lost it i feel its nothin to lose
the streets sure to release the worst side of my best
dont mind cause now you ever in debt to good kid maad city

mass hallucination baby
ill education baby
want to reconnect with your elations
this is your station baby

drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
and that means the world to me
and that means the world to me
and that means the world to me
and that means the world to me
somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
and this i know

i got one hundred on my dash got two hundred in my drum
name in the grab bags put my bible in the trunk
taaka vodka on the top of my binocular im drunk
how come i can make them popular pop em when i want
see im livin with anxiety duckin the sobriety
fuckin up the system i aint fuckin with society
justice aint free therefore justice aint me
so i justify his name on obituary
why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart
once upon a time i used to go to church and talk to god
now im thinkin to myself hollow tips is all i got
now im drinkin by myself at the intersection parked
watch you when you walk inside your house
you threw your briefcase all on the couch
i plan on creeping through your fuckin door and blowin out
every piece of your brain until your son jump in your arms
cut on the engine then sped off in the rain im gone

somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
drowned inside the lake outside away you flow
and that means the world to me
and that means the world to me
and that means the world to me
and that means the world to me

drove alone with a bottle of his own grippin the handle
lit off henny im tryna dismantle
these wicked ways ive engaged in such a gamble
cause i could speak the truth and i know the world would unravel wait
thats a bit ambitious maybe im trippin
maybe im crazy maybe i exist in a different dimension
not to mention when i close my eyes i see the distance
its such a scary sight so i rarely go to sleep at night
i watch the sun rise then i watch the sun fall
studied the son of god and still dont recognize my flaws
i guess im lost the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful
i pray my experience helps you
as for me im tryna sort it out
searching for loopholes in my bruised soul
but who knows
i just need a little space to breathe
i know perception is key so i am king

the other side has never mortified my mortal mind
the borderline between insanity is father time
i fall behind my skeleton they tell me that im blind
i know that im intelligent my confidence just died
carpe diem seize the day i cant compromise
a tape worm couldnt cure this gluttonous appetite
a couple trinkets they seein me as i pacify
but couldnt fathom the meaning of seein sacrifice
im passin lives on a daily maybe im losing faith
genocism and capitalism just made me hate
correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
professional dream killers reason why im awake
im sleep walkin im street stalkin im outta place
reinforcing this heat barking these are the brakes
before i blink do i see me before them pearly gates
or this is just a mirage or a facade
wait


they say the government mislead the youth youth youth youth
tell em when you went to the park and everybody came back and
and welfare dont mean well for you you you you
what about when you tried to do a side for that but you
they tell me that my bills past due due due due
talk about the charge you got
and preacher man dont always tell the truth truth truth truth
do you believe in god if you dont its cool

but head is the answer head is the future
dont second guess yourself
dont tell them when you second guess yourself i need you in the kitchen now i forgot
come on give me some help hey
head is the answer do it for the future girl

and i just wanna

why so sad
walking around with them blue faces
she said im down on my luck
and its something i gotta have
blue faces
i hit the bank today and told them color me bad
blue faces
get that new money and its breaking me down honey

two tears in the bucket i cry with you
but i could never lie with you
i could never afford not to afford
i could never put my plans to the side with you
i could never see a red light
like a deer with a headlight
i freeze up when i reup
see i barely have patience
and youre relating
only the moment to complete us
why you hate to work for it
the reason i never went to work for it
see a nine to five was so jive turkey
but when thanksgiving came that check didnt hurt me
you plead the fifth
i read the fifth amendment
we both criminals with bad intentions
they say time heals all
but if i can shortcut
my success corvettes by tomorrow
wait a minute

now why you so sad
walking around with them blue faces
she said im down on my luck
and its something i gotta have
blue faces
i hit the bank today and told them color me bad
blue faces
get that new money and its breaking me down honey

my home girl got a credit card scam
she got a scholarship to college but she dont give a damn
intuition got a broke bitch wishin
she tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
i know you woman i console you woman
you feel like the universe owes you woman
oh the anticipation of hoping you could make it
bitches dont prosper chasing education
but youre talented and cant handle it
and your homegirls cant be your manager
three hundred and sixtyfive times four plus more
if you cant get it right tell me do you got the stamina
but shit aint no money like fast money
even today im considered a crash dummy
a rapper chasing stardom how can i fast forward
my accolades better than all them

why you so sad
walking around with them blue faces
she said im down on my luck
and its something i gotta have
blue faces
i hit the bank today and told them color me bad
blue faces
get that new money and its breaking me down honey

i wrote this song looking at a broke home baby
you know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and babies
somebody yell kendrick american they sho is crazy
and i said why
then he looked me in the eye and said nigga you fucked up
youre banking on good luck you wishing for miracles
you never been through shit youre crying hysterical
you settle for everything complain about everything
you say you sold crack my world amphetamine
your projects aint shit i live in a hut bitch
im living to keep warm you living to pay rent
i prayed my way through by waiting on allah
you played your way through by living in scifi
bullshitting yourself you talking to strangers
same thing goes for the ones you came with
when yall came on the boat looking for hope
and all you can say is that youre looking for dope
these days aint no compromise
and your pain aint mines half the time
a brand new excuse aint shit to me
bitch i made my moves with shackled feet
cape town

in todays day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
you wait on them him and her
but when a blessing takes too long thats when you go wrong
you selfish motherfucker

why so sad
walking around with them blue faces
she said im down on my luck
and its something i gotta have
blue faces
i hit the bank today and told them color me bad
blue faces
get that new money and its breaking me down honey

between sheets covers and pillows
im promising your lack of tolerance stuck on a zero
im promising that im acknowledging you as my hero
cause you believe in me
no youre not easily impressed
but i possess qualities that you need to see
look at my flaws look at my flaws
look at my imperfections in awe
look how you unique that my mystique is a round of applause
and yours equally valued
you stick out like an alien compared to those around you
and thats alright because i like it

i seen it vividly jogging my brain memory life is
i seen it vividly jogging my brain memory
life no longer infinity this was the final calling
no birds chirping or flying no dogs barking
we all nervous and crying moving in caution
in disbeliefs our beliefs the reason for all this
the tallest building plummet cracking and crumbling
the ground is shaking swallowing young woman
with a baby daisies and other flowers burning in destruction
the smell is disgusting the heat is unbearable
preachers touching on boys run for cover the paranoid
rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
valleys and high places turn into dust
famous screaming in agony
atheists for suicide planes falling out the sky
trains jumping off the track mothers yelling hes alive
backpedaling christians settling for forgiveness
evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
ocean water dried out fire burning more tides out
tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
public bathroom college classrooms been deserted
another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
its happening no more running from world wars
its happening no more discriminating the poor
its happening no more bad bitches and real niggas
wishing for green and gold the last taste of allure
i swore i seen it vividly
a moniker of war from heaven that play the symphony
thunder like number four then i heard
what have you did for me
i fell to my knees pulled out my resume
that dated back to june seventeenth one thousand nine hundred and eightyseven
my paperwork was like a receipt
i was valedictorian i was fearful of judgment
but confident i had glory in all my past endeavors
close my eyes pray to god that i live forever
dark skies fire and brimstone some of us sent home
some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
geez louise i thought you said that i excel
i made to pimp a butterfly for you
told me to use my vocals to save mankind for you
say i didnt try for you say i didnt ride for you
i tithed for you i pushed the club to the side for you
who love you like i love you
crucifix tell me you can fix
anytime i need imma start jotting everything in my diary
never would you lie to me
always camaraderie i can see our days been numbered
revelation greatest as we hearing the last trumpet
all man child woman life completely went in reverse
i guess im running in place trying to make it to church

young nigga act an ass
young nigga act a fool
young nigga get yo cash
young nigga do what it do
young nigga go young nigga go
young nigga go young nigga go
whatever makes all of you happy in this bitch
just take it all back before the light switch

what did the asian say a peace of mind
thats what the asian saidi need a divine
intervention was his religion and i was surprised
him believing in buddha me believing in god
asked him what are you doing he said taking my time
meditation is a must it dont hurt if you try
see you thinking too much plus you too full of yourself
worried about your career you ever think of your health

what did the indian say a piece of land
thats what the indian saidi needed the man
telling me longevity is in the dirt
should buy some property first
should profit a better dollar with generational perks
equity at his best really you should invest
these tangible things expire dont you expect
income with so much outcome and yes
look at my heritage we blessed
now what the black man say a piece of pussy
thats what the black man said i needed to push me
to the limit to satisfy my hunger
we do it all for a woman from haircut to a war
we like to live in the jungle like to play in the peach
what you saying to me
he said nigga come back to reality for a week
pussy is power fuck on a new bitch every night
i wouldnt be prouder you should allow it

what the white man say a piece of mines
thats what the white man wanted when i rhyme
telling me that he selling me just for one thousand and ninetynine
if i go platinum from rapping i do the company fine
what if i compromise he said it dont even matter
you make a million or more you living better than average
you losing your core following gaining it all
he put a price on my talent i hit the bank and withdraw
hit the bank and withdraw hit the bank and withdraw
put myself in the rocket ship and i shot for the stars
look at what you accomplished and what he said to the boy
ima make you some promises that you just cant ignore
your profession anonymous as an artist if i dont target your market
if you aint signing your signature when i throw you my wallet
a lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
your world tour your masters mortgage i need a piece


i holler what you do what you say
i shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if i get freed today
i holler what you do what you say
i shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if i get freed today

before you step out of line and dance with the star
i could never end a career if it never start
the murderous capital avenues lookin like evil dead zombies
with batteries to the head
the flattery of watchin my stock rise
the salary the compensation tripled my cock size
i run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
just premium gas do it for dolo
crash markets and prejudiced tags look at my photo
black excellence pessimist died countin my coin
hope its evident that i inspired a thousand emcees to do better
i blew cheddar on youth centers buildings and bimmers and blue leather

the hardest thing for me to do
is to get you to know me within sixteen bars

who is k dot a young nigga from compton
on the curb writing raps next to a gunshot
on the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
the fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
everyone i knew was either crip or piru
cousins in elementary relatives in high school
with that being said each one of their rivals
was aiming something at my head i needed survival
got jumped got jacked shot at shot back
and i dont even push a line im just tryna push these rhymes
in the midst of staying neutral and discrete
my momma said youre judged by the company you keep
but what you can consider that if it goes down
theyll kill you if you kill me it gets deep nigga
so if you ask what im doing
im tryna duck the influence of my city thats brewing real talk and

this is why they fuck with me real talk nigga believe it
this is why they fuck with me do what i do ya know
im no gangster no killer im just your average joe know that
but one thing you should consider im the realest you know

i was walking from centennial
when an unidentified vehicle rolled up and i was like hol up
where you from i dont bang
where you stay westside thats a piru gang to be exact
well aware they had blue across they hat
dropped backpack and ran inside of the culdesac
shots rang out hoping to god i wasnt wet
crossed across rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
chirped the homies on the ininetyfive they said they already knew
what happened and meet em outside the garage
never seen that many guns in my life
i was paranoid like a fiend in the night but needed revenge
grabbed the nineball opened up the door then got in
somebody said fall back we gon make these niggas suffer
you my brother like a frat and thats just to remind you
thought about that so long i had failed my finals fuck but

this is why they fuck with me i told you nigga
this is why they fuck with me you fake nigga
im no gangster no killer im just your average joe you fake
but one thing you should consider im the realest you know

i dont do black music i dont do white music
i do everyday life music
give em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
you say you through but ive been through it now thats cold
and this is for my county building children
in hub city on hubcaps no powersteering
i use perseverance in this mad city
where the niggas drink remy and hold semis for cutthroats
bernie mac died its no joke
dont ask why if you dont know about these killers and thieves
seven grams of weed you smoke that but im high off life
i could fall out the sky like twice
and land in the land of the aks
and the minivans where the fan never on
cause its hotter than a lunatics underarms in a straitjacket
in other words we get it cracking but i keep it cool you know

this is why they fuck with me haha
this is why they fuck with me real talk
im no gangster no killer im just your average joe come on
but one thing you should consider im the realest you know

so there you have it

chasing for the wind but you never win the track meet
oh what a cold world for a broke nigga its bitter
and lifes a bitch dont hit women so i bit her
i struck enough pain let her know i wasnt playing
i was so sincere like nas first name in belly
they tell me its very difficult to see twentyfive
and if i survive its probably with a celly
my opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats
in the ghetto rather in some heels like giuseppes
they want me unemployed until i hit the streets
fulfilling voids of broke dboys selling weed
fucking up my prestige til i live with the blues
bb king or the neighbors of snoop thats why im

where are you going now
why are you slowing down
why why why

where are we going
why are we slowing down
where are you going
we should be growing now

try and visualize how to get it right
but my visions so blurry
trying to slow it down
take us to the ground
but were always in a hurry now
and if i could make this world spin a little slower
then i would and we could grow a little closer
i think were getting closer

where are we going
closer closer closer
why are we slowing
we think were getting closer
where are you going
closer closer closer
we should be growing now

so in conclusion
sometimes we lose focus
planning our whole demise
were getting the big picture and making it the wallet size
so to whats important in my life i apologize
i hope to stay faithful focused and sanctified
we all get distracted
the question is would you bounce back or bounce backwards
you wouldnt know how to act or would you take action
thats just a part of life and if your visions impaired
youll probably lose it all tonight

whats going on marvin dearly departed
young marta bar or parker 
upon them all upon mighty days
but sweet alcoholic nights are feeling faraway
son can only skype with his pop stop
hes only feeling love from his mom
got rocks in my stomach
i can feel my soul bleed self love
but i never want my son to be me holla at me
so i pray until i feel its not working
im a showman on the surface
either way its perfect
you ever feel like the purpose aint worth it
well i do im the poster child for young fathers working
i swear to god i wanna be free
and he just wanna be me
and i just wanna be him
im jealous and discreetly
im one of your own
im trying to raise a child
still trying to raise me right now
where am i gone

try and visualize how to get it right
but my visions are blurry
trying to slow it down
stay close to the ground
but we were always in a hurry now
and if i could make this world spin a little slower
then i would and we could grow a little closer

where are we going
why
why are you going
why are we growing apart
we should be growing together
right

mimicking radios nemesis made me wack
my innocence limited the experience lacked
ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
the mind of a literate writer but i did it in fact
you admitted it once i submitted it wrapped in plastic
remember scribblin scratchin dilligent sentences backwards
visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
now i can live in a stadium pack it the fastest
gamblin benjamin benefits sinnin in traffic
spinnin women in cartwheels linen fabric on fashion
winnin in every decision
kendrick is master that mastered it
isnt it lovely how menaces turned attraction
pivotin rappers finish your fraction while writing blue magic
thank god for rap i would say it got me a plaque

i met a little boy that resembled my features
nappy afro gap in his smile
handmedown sneakers bounced through the crowd
run a number on man and woman that crossed him
sun beamin on his beady beads exhausted
tossin footballs with his ashy black ankles
breakin new laws mama passed on home trainin
he looked at me and said kendrick you do know my language
you just forgot because of what public schools had painted
oh i forgot dont kill my vibe thats right youre famous
i used to watch on channel five tv was taken
but never mind youre here right now dont you mistake it
its just a new trip take a glimpse of your familys ancestor
make a new list of everything you thought was progress
and that was bullshit
i know your life is full of turmoil
spoiled by fantasies of who you are i feel bad for you
i can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin you
if you resist ill back off quick go catch a flight or two

to come back home

and if you riding with me nigga let me ask this question nigga

i remember you was conflicted
misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same
abusing my power full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screaming in the hotel room
i didnt wanna self destruct
the evils of lucy was all around me
so i went running for answers
until i came home
but that didnt stop survivors guilt
going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes i earned
or maybe how aone my foundation was
but while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city
i was entering a new one
a war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what i learned
the word was respect
just because you wore a different gang color than mines
doesnt mean i cant respect you as a black man
forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
if i respect you we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
but i dont know im no mortal man
maybe im just another nigga
shit and thats all i wrote
i was gonna call it another nigga but it aint really a poem
i just felt like its something you probably could relate to
other than that now that i finally got a chance to holla at you
i always wanted to ask you about a certain situa
about a metaphor actually uh you spoke on the ground
what you mean by that what the ground represent
the ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
right
thats how i see it my word is bond
i seeand the ground is the symbol for the poor people
right
the poor people is gonna open up this whole world
and swallow up the rich people
cause the rich people gonna be so fat
and they gonna be so appetizing you know what im saying wealthy appetizing
the poor gonna be so poor and hungry
right
you know what im saying its gonna be like
you know what im saying its gonna be
there might there might be some cannibalism out this muhfu
they might eat the rich you know what im saying
aight so let me ask you this then
do you see yourself as somebody thats rich
or somebody that made the best of they own opportunities
i see myself as a natural born hustler
a true hustler in every sense of the word
i took nothin i took the opportunities
i worked at the most menial and degrading job
and built myself up so i could get it to where i owned it
i went from having somebody managing me
to me hiring the person that works my management company
i changed everything i realized my destiny
in a matter of five years you know what im saying
i made myself a millionaire i made millions for a lot of people
now its time to make millions for myself you know what im saying
i made millions for the record companies
i made millions for these movie companies
now i make millions for for us
and through your different avenues of success
how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity
by my faith in god by my faith in the game
and by my faith in all good things come to those that stay true
right
you know what im saying
and it was happening to me for a reason
you know what im saying i was noticing shit
i was punching the right buttons and it was happening
so its no problem you know
i mean its a problem but im not finna let them know
im finna go straight through
would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that
somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall
shit i like to think that at every opportunity ive ever been uh threatened with resistance its been met with resistance
and not only me but it goes down my family tree
you know what im saying its in my veins to fight back
aight well how long will you think it take before niggas be like
we fighting a war im fighting a war i cant win
and i wanna lay it all down
in this country a black man only have like
five years we can exhibit maximum strength
and thats right now while you a teenager while you still strong
while you still wanna lift weights while you still wanna shoot back
cause once you turn thirty its like
they take the heart and soul out of a man
out of a black man in this country
and you dont wanna fight no more
and if you dont believe me you can look around
you dont see no loud mouth thirtyyear old motherfuckers
thats crazy because me being one of your offsprings
of the legacy you left behind i can truly tell you that
theres nothing but turmoil goin on so i wanted to ask you
what you think is the future for me and my generation today
i think that niggas is tired of grabbin shit out the stores
and next time its a riot its gonna be like uh bloodshed
for real i dont think america know that
i think america think we was just playing
and its gonna be some more playing but
it aint gonna be no playing
its gonna be murder you know what im saying
its gonna be like nat turner one thousand eight hundred and thirtyone up in this motherfucker
you know what im saying its gonna happen
thats crazy man in my opinion
only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations
lot a people dont understand how important it is you know
sometimes i can like get behind a mic
and i dont know what type of energy ima push out
or where it comes from trip me out sometimes
because its spirits we aint even really rappin
we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us
damn
i wanted to read one last thing to you
its actually something a good friend had wrote
describing my world it says
the caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
in order to protect itself from this mad city
while consuming its environment
the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
one thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him
but praises the butterfly
the butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness
and the beauty within the caterpillar
but having a harsh outlook on life
the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
already surrounded by this mad city
the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon
which institutionalizes him
he can no longer see past his own thoughts
hes trapped
when trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root such as
going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
the result
wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations
that the caterpillar never considered ending the internal struggle
although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
they are one and the same
whats your perspective on that
pac pac pac


i remember you was conflicted misusing your influence
sometimes i did the same
woman moaning
if these walls could talk
if these walls could talk
if these walls could talk
if these walls could talk
if these walls could talk
if these walls could talk
sex

she just want to close her eyes and sway
with you with you with you
exercise her right to work it out
its true its true its true
shout out to the birthday girls
say hey hey say hey hey ah girl
everyone deserves a night to play play
she plays only when you tell her no

if these walls could talk
i can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
if these walls could talk
i love it when im in it i love it when im in it

if these walls could talk theyd tell me to swim good
no boat i float better than he would
no life jacket im not the god of nazareth
but your flood can be misunderstood
walls telling me they full of pain resentment
need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
me im just a tenant
landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
these walls are vulnerable exclamation
interior pink color coordinated
i interrogated every nook and cranny
i mean its still amazing before they couldnt stand me
these walls want to cry tears
these walls happier when im here
these walls never could hold up
every time i come around demolition might crush

if these walls could talk
i can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
if these walls could talk
i love it when im in it i love it when im in it

if these walls could talk theyd tell me to go deep
yelling at me continuously i can see
your defense mechanism is my decision
knock these walls down thats my religion
walls feeling like they ready to close in
i suffocate then catch my second wind
i resonate in these walls
i dont know how long i can wait in these walls
ive been on the streets too long
looking at you from the outside in
they sing the same old song
about how they walls always the cleanest
i beg to differ i mustve missed them
im not involved id rather diss em
id rather call on you put your wall up
cause when i come around demolition gon crush

if these walls could talk
i can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you
if these walls could talk
i love it when im in it i love it when im in it


if your walls could talk theyd tell you its too late
your destiny accept it your fate
burn accessories and stash them on the yard
take the recipe the bible and god
wall telling you that commissary is low
race wars happening no calling co
no calling your mother to save you
homies to say youre irrepetible not acceptable
your behavior is sammy the bull like
a killer that turned snitch
walls is telling me you a bitch
you pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
that sentence so important
walls telling you to listen to sing about me
retaliation is strong you even dream bout me
killed my homeboy and god spared your life
dumb criminal got indicted same night
so when you play this song rewind the first verse
about me abusing my power so you can hurt
about me and her in the shower whenever she horny
about me and her in the after hours of the morning
about her baby daddy currently serving life
and how she think about you until we meet up at night
about the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
and how she fuckin on a famous rapper
walls can talk talk

i remember you was conflicted
misusin your influence
sometimes i did the same
abusin my power full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screamin in a hotel room


everything black i dont want black they want us to bow
i want everything black i aint need black down to our knees

im the biggest hypocrite of two thousand and fifteen
once i finish this witnesses will convey just what i mean
i mean its evident that im irrelevant to society
thats what youre telling me penitentiary would only hire me
curse me till im dead
church me with your fake prophesizing that ima be just another slave in my head
institutionalized manipulation and lies
reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
you hate me dont you
i know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
jealous of my wisdom and cards i dealt
watchin me as i pull up fill up my tank then peel out

woi we feel a whole heap of pain cah we black
and man a say they put me inna chains cah we black
imagine now big gold chains full of rocks
how you no see the whip left scars pon me back
but now we have a big whip parked pon the block
all them say we doomed from the start cah we black

thats as blunt as it gets i know you hate me dont you
you hate my people i can tell cause its threats when i see you
i can tell cause your ways deceitful
know i can tell because youre in love with that desert eagle
thinkin maliciously he get a chain then you gone bleed him
its funny how zulu and xhosa might go to war
two tribal armies that want to build and destroy
remind me of these compton crip gangs that live next door
beefin with pirus only death settle the score
so dont matter how much i say i like to preach with the panthers
or tell georgia state marcus garvey got all the answers
or try to celebrate february like its my bday
or eat watermelon chicken and koolaid on weekdays
or jump high enough to get michael jordan endorsements
or watch bet cause urban support is important
so why did i weep when trayvon martin was in the street
when gang banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me
hypocrite

trying to convince myself the stripes i earned

but while my loved ones was fighting
a continuous war back in the city
i was entering a new one

life to me like a box of chocolate
quid pro quo somethin for somethin thats the obvious
oh shit flows so sick dont you swallow it
bitin my style youre salmonella poison positive
i can just alleviate the rap industry politics
milk the game up never lactose intolerant
the last remainder of real shit you know the obvious
me scholarship no streets put me through colleges
be all you can be true but the problem is
dream only a dream if work dont follow it
remind me of the homies that used to know me now follow this
ill tell you my hypothesis im probably just way too loyal
k dizzle will do it for you my niggas think im a god
truthfully all of em spoiled usually youre never charged
but somethin came over you once i took you to them fuckin bet awards
you lookin at artistses like theyre harvestses
so many rollies around you and you want all of them
somebody told me you thinkin bout snatchin jewelry
i shouldve listened when my grandmama said to me

shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass nigga
shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass boy
shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass nigga
oh now slow down

and once upon a time in a city so divine
called west side compton there stood a little nigga
he was five foot something god bless the kid
took his homie to the show and this is what they said

fuck am i posed to do when im lookin at walkin licks
the constant big money talk bout the mansion and foreign whips
the private jets and passport presidential glass floor
gold bottles gold models givin up the ass for
instagram flicks suckin dick fuck is this
one more sucker wavin with a flashy wrist
my defense mechanism tell me to get him
quickly because he got it
its a recession then why the fuck he at king of diamonds
no more livin poor meet my fourfour
when i see em put the per diem on the floor
now kendrick know theyre your coworkers
but its gon take a lot fore this pistol go cold turkey
now i can watch his watch on the tv and be okay
but see im on the clock once that watch landin in la
remember steal from the rich and givin it back to the poor
well thats me at these awards
i guess my grandmama was warnin a boy
she said

shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass nigga
shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass boy
shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass nigga
oh now slow down

and once upon a time in a city so divine
called west side compton there stood a little nigga
he was five foot something dazed and confused
talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
you can take your boy out the hood
but you cant take the hood out the homie
took his show money stashed it in the mozey wozey
hollywoods nervous
fuck you goodnight thank you much for your service

how much a dollar really cost
the question is detrimental paralyzin my thoughts
parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling yall
gotta see how im chillin once i park this luxury car
hopping out feeling big as mutombo
twenty on pump six dirty marcellus called me dumbo
twenty years ago cant forget
now i can lend him a ear or two
how to stack these residuals tenfold
the liberal concept of what menll do
twenty on six he didnt hear me
indigenous african only spoke zulu
my american tongue was slurry
walked out the gas station
a homeless man with a semitan complexion
asked me for ten rand stressin about dry land
deep water powder blue skies that crack open
a piece of crack that he wanted i knew he was smokin
he begged and pleaded
asked me to feed him twice i didnt believe it
told him beat it
contributin money just for his pipe i couldnt see it
he said my son temptation is one thing that ive defeated
listen to me i want a single bill from you
nothin less nothin more
i told him i aint have it and closed my door
tell me how much a dollar cost

its more to feed your mind
water sun and love the one you love
all you need the air you breathe

hes starin at me in disbelief
my temper is buildin hes starin at me i grab my key
hes starin at me i started the car then i tried to leave
and somethin told me to keep it in park until i could see
the reason why he was mad at a stranger
like i was supposed to save him
like im the reason hes homeless and askin me for a favor
hes starin at me his eyes followed me with no laser
hes starin at me i notice that his stare is contagious
cause now im starin back at him feelin some type of disrespect
if i could throw a bat at him itd be aimin at his neck
i never understood someone beggin for goods
askin for handouts takin it if they could
and this particular person just had it down pat
starin at me for the longest until he finally asked
have you ever opened up exodus fourteen
a humble man is all that we ever need
tell me how much a dollar cost

its more to feed your mind
water sun and love the one you love
all you need the air you breathe

guilt trippin and feelin resentment
i never met a transient that demanded attention
they got me frustrated indecisive and power trippin
sour emotions got me lookin at the universe different
i should distance myself i should keep it relentless
my selfishness is what got me here who the fuck im kiddin
so imma tell you like i told the last bum
crumbs and pennies i need all of mines
and i recognize this type of panhandlin all the time
i got better judgment i know when niggas hustlin keep in mind
when i was strugglin i did compromise now i comprehend
i smell grandpas old medicine reekin from your skin
moonshine and gin nigga youre babblin your words aint flatterin
im imaginin denzel but lookin at oneal
kazaam is sad thrills your gimmick is mediocre
the jig is up i seen you from a mile away losin focus
and im insensitive and i lack empathy
he looked at me and said your potential is bittersweet
i looked at him and said every nickel is mines to keep
he looked at me and said know the truth itll set you free
youre lookin at the messiah the son of jehovah the higher power
the choir that spoke the word the holy spirit
the nerve of nazareth and ill tell you just how much a dollar cost
the price of having a spot in heaven embrace your loss i am god

i washed my hands i said my grace
what more do you want from me
tears of a clown guess im not all what its all meant to be
shades of grey will never change if i condone
turn this page help me change to right my wrongs

looking like a star with a real nice car a mercedes key
she got a nigga and she love this nigga well at least i think
everytime we bark she pay us no mind in the middle of the street
she be like

fuck them other niggas cause im down for my nigga
fuck them other niggas cause im down for my nigga
fuck them other niggas ill ride for my nigga
ill die for my nigga fuck them other

until one day he wasnt acting right
in the middle of the night she checked his phone erica right
when he plead the fifth man it was on matter of fact she gone
matter of fact tyrone was on speed dial
so when she got home it was going down she go

fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
sick of lies from her nigga fuck that other

i know this girl she a real hood girl and she with the shit
keep her hair tied up big bamboos mike jordan kicks
with that big butt but when i try to holla she gon resist
in her man she trust so when i walk by her she be screaming this
she be like

fuck them other niggas cause im down for my nigga
fuck them other niggas cause im down for my nigga
fuck them other niggas ill ride for my nigga
ill die for my nigga fuck them other

until one day he wasnt acting right in the middle of the night
she checked his pockets found condoms by magnum
and the moment they was acknowledged she popped his eye
then ran outside then started driving on the passenger side
homeboy was smiling she gon

fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
sick of lies from her nigga fuck that other

and so these girls these vulnerable girls took they men up

it was only getting they feelings hurt tell me how that sound
they got fed up with the biggest question mark they curious now
cause when women get sick of men they think of a big helping hand
to lend each other uncover emotions when lights dim
so when she telling her to come over itll be alright
the minute she hit the block and turn left shell be turning dyke they

fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
fuck with other bitches on the side cause these niggas

marijuana endorphins make you stronger stronger
im in the house party trippin off
my generation sippin cough syrup like its water

man not one of our lives is caught up
in the daily superstition that the world is bout to end
who gives a fuck we never do listen
less it comes with a eight hundred and eight a melody and some hoes
playstation and some drank technology bought my soul
lookin around and all i see
is a big crowd thats product of me
and they probably relatives relevant for a rebels dream

then she said read between the lines
yep hope that i get close enough when the lights turn down
and the fact that she just might open up
when the nuvo start to drown
her body and i know
the both of us really deep in the mood now
its nothin we can do now
somebody walked in with a pound of that bay area kush

fancy girls on long beach boulevard
flagging down all of these flashy cars

uh and lord knows shes beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
she take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
she play mr shakur thats her favorite rapper
bumping brendas got a baby while a pervert yelling at her
and she capture features of a woman but only seventeen
the seven cars start honking she start running like flojo
dont care if they joe blow
if they got money to blow a blow job is a sure go
and sure enough dont see a dime of dirty dollars
she give all to her daddy but she dont know her father thats ironic
see a block away from lueders park i seen the el camino parked
in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
rosa parks never a factor when she making ends meet

fancy girls on long beach boulevard
flagging down all of these flashy cars

and lord knows shes beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
her anatomy is gods temple
and its quite simple her castle is bout to be destroyed
shes always paranoid watching the law inside the streets
undercovers the dummies that look like decoys
remember the sergeant let her slide said if he seen
whats between her thighs hed compromise to no surprise
she took the ultimatum round the alleyway and gave him
a warm welcome that filled him right below the navel
though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
his eyes was closed shut prior charges he had waived em
it was a block away from lueders park i seen a squad car parked
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
cause rosa parks never a factor when she topping off police

fancy girls on long beach boulevard
flagging down all of these flashy cars

and lord knows shes beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
as she bust down like a twelve bunk on tour
she suddenly realized shell never escape the allure
of a black man white man needing satisfaction
at first it became a practice but now shes numb to it
sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
but she never heard of catholic religion or sinners redemption
that sounds foolish and you can blame it on her mother
for letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
ten months before she was ten he moved in and thats when he touched her
this mothafucka is the fucking reason why keisha rushing through that
block away from lueders park i seen the el camino park
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters still she hit the back seat
and caught a knife inside the bladder left for dead raped in the street
keishas song

my little sister eleven i looked her right in the face
the day that i wrote this song sat her down and pressed play

fancy girls on long beach boulevard
flagging down all of these flashy cars

time passin things change
revertin back to our daily programs stuck in our ways

it was always me vs the world
until i found its me vs me
why why why why
why why why why
just remember what happens on earth stays on earth
we gon put it in reverse

darling i told you many times
and i am telling you once again
just to remind you sweetheart
that my

oh lamar
hail mary and marijuana times is hard
pray with the hooligans shadows all in the dark
fellowship with demons and relatives im a star
life is one funny mothafucka
a true comedian you gotta love him you gotta trust him
i might be buggin infomercials and no sleep
introverted by my thoughts children listen it gets deep
see once upon a time inside the nickerson garden projects
the object was to process and digest povertys dialect
adaptation inevitable gun violence crack spot
federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
anthony was the oldest of seven
wellrespected calm and collected
laughin and jokin made life easier hard times momma on crack
a fouryearold tellin his nanny he needed her
his family history pimpin and bangin
he was meant to be dangerous
clocked him a grip and start slangin
fifteen scrapin up his jeans with quarter pieces
even got some head from a smoker last weekend
dodged a policeman workin for his big homie
smalltime hustler graduated to a brick on him
ten thousand dollars out of a project housing thats on the daily
seen his first mil twenty years old had a couple of babies
had a couple of shooters
caught a murder case fingerprints on the gun they assumin
but witnesses couldnt prove it
that was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
he beat the case and went back to hustlin
birdshufflin anthony rang
the first in the projects with the twotone mustang
that fifty thing they say fifty came
circlin parking lots and parking spots
and hoppin out while harrassin the corner blocks
crooked cops told anthony he should kick it
he brushed em off and walked back to the kentucky fried chicken
see at this chicken spot
there was a lightskinned nigga that talked a lot
with a curly top and a gap in his teeth
he worked the window his name was ducky
he came from the streets the robert taylor homes
southside projects chiraq the terror dome
drove to california with a woman on him and five hundred dollars
they had a son hopin that hed see college
hustlin on the side with a ninetofive to freak it
cadillac seville hed ride his son around on weekends
threepiece special with his name on the shirt pocket
cross the street from the projects anthony planned to rob it
stuck up the place before back in eightyfour
thats when affiliation was really eight gears of war
so many relatives tellin us sellin us devilish works
killin us crime intelligent felonious
prevalent proposition with nines
ducky was wellaware
they robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
he figured hed get on these niggas good sides
free chicken every time anthony posted in line
two extra biscuits anthony liked him and then let him slide
they didnt kill him in fact it look like theyre the last to survive
pay attention that one decision changed both of they lives
one curse at a time
reverse the manifest and good karma and ill tell you why
you take two strangers and put em in random predicaments
give em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
twenty years later them same strangers you make em meet again
inside recording studios where they reapin their benefits
then you start remindin them about that chicken incident
whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence
because if anthony killed ducky top dawg could be servin life
while i grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

so i was takin a walk the other day

when i was twentyseven i grew accustomed to more fear
accumulated ten times over throughout the years
my newfound life made all of me magnified
how many accolades do i need to block denial
the shock value of my success put bolts in me
all this money is god playin a joke on me
is it for the moment and will he see me as job
take it from me and leave me worse than i was before
at twentyseven my biggest fear was losin it all
scared to spend money had me sleepin from hall to hall
scared to go back to section eight with my mama stressin
thirty shows a month and i still wont buy me no lexus
what is an advisor somebody thats holdin my checks
just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt
i read a case about rihannas accountant and wondered
how did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers
the type of shitll make me flip out and just kill somethin
drill somethin get ill and fill ratchets with a lil somethin
i practiced runnin from fear guess i had some good luck
at twentyseven years old my biggest fear was bein judged
how they look at me reflect on myself my family my city
what they say bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
what they see from me would trickle down generations in time
what they hear from me would make em highlight my simplest lines

im talkin fear fear of losin creativity
im talkin fear fear of missin out on you and me
im talkin fear fear of losin loyalty from pride
cause my dna wont let me involve in the light of god
im talkin fear fear that my humbleness is gone
im talkin fear fear that love aint livin here no more
im talkin fear fear that its wickedness or weakness
fear whatever it is both is distinctive
fear what happens on earth stays on earth
and i cant take these feelings with me so hopefully they disperse
within fourteen tracks carried out over wax
searchin for resolutions until somebody get back
fear what happens on earth stays on earth
and i cant take these feelings with me so hopefully they disperse
within fourteen tracks carried out over wax
wonderin if im livin through fear or livin through rap
damn

god damn you god damn me
god damn us god damn we
god damn us all

verse two says you only have i known of all the families of the earth therefore i will punish you for all your iniquities
so until we come back to these commandments
until you come back to these commandments
we gonna feel this way we gonna be under this curse
because he said hes gonna punish us
the socalled blacks hispanics and native american indians
are the true children of israel
we are the israelites according to the bible
the children of israel
hes gonna punish us for our iniquities for our disobedience
because we chose to follow other gods
that man chasten his son so the lord thy god chasten thee
so just like you chasten your own son hes gonna chastise you
because he loves you so thats why we get chastised
thats why were in the position that were in
until we come back to these laws statutes and commandments
and do what the lord says these curses is gonna be upon us
we gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
here in today in the united states of america
i love you family and i pray for you
god bless you

loves gonna get you killed
but prides gonna be the death of you and you and me
and you and you and you and me
and you and you and you and me
and you and you and you and me and

me i wasnt taught to share but care
in another life i surely was there
me i wasnt taught to share but care
i care i care

hellraising wheelchasing new worldy possessions
fleshmaking spiritbreaking which one would you lessen
the better part the human heart you love em or dissect em
happiness or flashiness how do you serve the question
see in a perfect world i would be perfect world
i dont trust people enough beyond they surface world
i dont love people enough to put my faith in man
i put my faith in these lyrics hoping i make a band
i understand i aint perfect i probably wont come around
this time i might put you down
last time i aint give a fuck i still feel the same now
my feelings might go numb youre dealing with cold thumb
im willing to give up a leg and arm than show empathy from
pity parties and functions of you and yours
a perfect world you probably live another twentyfour
i cant fake humble just cause your ass is insecure
i cant fake humble just cause your ass is insecure

me i wasnt taught to share but care
in another life i surely was there
me i wasnt taught to share but care
i care i care

maybe i wasnt there
maybe i wasnt there
maybe i wasnt there
maybe i wasnt there

now in a perfect world i probably wont be insensitive
cold as december but never remember what winter did
i wouldnt blame you for mistakes i made or the bed i laid
seems like i point the finger just to make a point nowadays
smiles and cold stares the temperature goes there
indigenous disposition feel like we belong here
i know the walls they can listen i wish they could talk back
the hurt becomes repetition the love almost lost that
sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
a perfect world is never perfect only filled with lies
promises are broken and more resentment come alive
race barriers make inferior you and i
see in a perfect world ill choose faith over riches
ill choose work over bitches ill make schools out of prison
ill take all the religions and put em all in one service
just to tell em we aint shit but hes been perfect world

me i wasnt taught to share but care
in another life i surely was there
me i wasnt taught to share but care
i care i care

maybe i wasnt there
maybe i wasnt there
maybe i wasnt there
maybe i wasnt there
