i made a decision despite all the things that we go thru
im going to take more time with you and be a friend indeed
i made a decision that everything will be alright
going to stay strong and keep it tight ill be there indeed
let me talk to you when it feels
like the sun aint shining bright enough
its like the devils trying to work to give
and though im blessed
i still gotta handle of things i go through
its good to have a friend with another perspective to show you
someone you know that knows you and gives you motivation
someone that you can go to and vent your frustration
we always talk about our peeps how we be everywhere
when you need em the most are they really ever there
see every thing be all good when we be havin fun
the difference is really needing a friend than having one
its good when your peoples are there to help your problems
and help you smile about it while finding a way to solve it
look at hear let me keep it at one hundred and let me tell ya
how you hold me down is something i genuinely value
i got a clearer view and being that
youre always here for me ill be here for you
i made a decision despite all the things that we go thru
im going to take more time with you and be a friend indeed
i made a decision that everything will be alright
going to stay strong and keep it tight ill be there indeed
well how you been baby but im sayin
even though we probably link up every now and then
with minimal convo look its real good to see you friend
something that we allow that i dont even have to mention
is whether or not you got me
thats something that i never question
sometimes i feel that the people
that i love dont appreciate me
and some hate to see the shit ive been going through lately
see you was here when it started to haywire
youre still here walkin with me going thru the fire
and i really love you for it i know you all relate too
on everything that i believe and i appreciate it you
and just for that it dont matter you can put that on my name
the way you rep me let me be there just for you the same
sometimes the pressure and the pain it be wearin me out
but i thank you for just bein there and for hearin me out
i got a clearer view i thank
god that youre here for me and im here for you
i made a decision despite all the things that we go thru
im going to take more time with you and be a friend indeed
i made a decision that everything will be alright
going to stay strong and keep it tight ill be there indeed
i look in your eye and i see the pain in it
lifes a game maybe the game did it
i know i changed they say the fame did it
lifes changed maybe the game did it
two friends now in two different places
and the mister catchin planes and you catching cases
friendship we never based it on position
no matter the game we both shared the same vision
decisions to split us in the place that life seemed to hit us
i would come to town and never get up with you
around then things werent so simple
i had my own issues that i was trying to get through
outside chatter messing with our mental
on the chase of trust you cant forget to
its the real friends that youve got to tend to
no matter how far just know that im with you
i made a decision despite all the things that we go thru
im going to take more time with you and be a friend indeed
i made a decision that everything will be alright
going to stay strong and keep it tight ill be there indeed
i made a decision

see ive been searchin for somethin out there
when is it comin tell me
what to tell myself
when i drink so much that it hurts my health
cause i stay up way too late
and i owe a million favors
i cant overstress myself
so i wrote it down to express myself
im lookin in the mirror tryna find
peace of mind in a piece of my
inspiration back from the beginning
lifes a movie i cant make revisions
ate an eighth of shrooms and started trippin
had some visions that were nonexistent
i think i just left the solar system
doesnt matter i still kept the rhythm
diamonds still gon light up like a prism
thats from years of grindin independent
what was at the bottom now has risen
if this isnt heaven then what is it
always real but never realistic
want the world but nothin in specific
dont need shootin stars to grant my wishes
im a superstar lets go and get it

kiss the skiiiiiiies the sky
kiss the skiiiiiiies the sky
kiss the skiiiiiiies the sky
kiss the skyyyyyyy

now can i lay underneath you
while they play all the previews
and ill pretend like im restin
maybe youll skip to the end and
pass all the irrational decisions
patch up all the passion that was missin
i think thats enough im feelin lovesick
rollin loud im on some turnin up shit
paid a couple hundred for a high that i couldnt get on my own on my own
and ive been lookin for a long time but i never found home
everything is alright im around for the long ride
go get drunk and find some trouble ayy
add some pieces to the puzzle ayy
couple rights couple wrongs
thats the prequel to the sequel yeah
and all the space in between us
are memories that we conceal
the jagged edges of a pill
remember what it is to feel
windows down behind the wheel
gotta do it for the thrill watch me

kiss the skiiiiiiies the sky
kiss the skiiiiiiies the sky
kiss the skiiiiiiies the sky
kiss the skyyyyyyy

this verse is for my
people on the grind
going to sleep at two
clocking in at nine
trying to go to school
thats why youre at the job

when youre reaching for the stars

everybody scared of a little change
thats why im always looking out for the little things
you should never be ashamed of a little fame
even bill gates back then had a little name
im just saying
yall know what its like when them lights go off in the condo
need a break from the bullshit pronto
spend your last check on a trip to chicago
and see your favorite band on the stage again
in your favorite shirt that you made for them
they play the song and you sang with them
because music heals the soul
and that moments thereso take it in
before youre back in that place again
in the uniform that you hate again
man this freedom for the world

im facing problems everyday
i cant solve em everyday
they want the truth everyday
im being honest everyday
i wake up everyday

everyday everyday everyday
this one for the girl whos feeling lost
because shes trying to find a way
find a way find a way find a way

i cant afford to go to jail
moms putting their houses up for bail
court stressed me out
thinking i need a better route
but all these hoes laugh when im ashy
and them boys rob if im flashy
and them older folks see my tattoos in their offices and low class me
man i dont know what im suppose to do
my family is not the huxtables
im just trying to keep my life together
without breaking all the rules
so i say like five prayers everyday
until my sins wear away
let that smoke in meditate
and just chill
thinking about better days
no more late night belly aches
use this food for thought everyday
so i will

this one for the boy who grew up
trying to feed his family everyday
everyday everyday everyday
this one for the girl whos feeling lost
because shes trying to find a way
find a way find a way find a way

he goes by the name of the big daddy kane
a mellow type of fellow thats laid back
back in the days he was nothing like that
i remember when he used to fight every day
what grownups would tell him he would never obey
he wore his pants hanging down and his sneakers untied
and a rastatype kangol tilted to the side
around his neighborhood people treated him bad
and said he was the worst thing his moms ever had
they said that he will grow up to be nothing but a hoodlum
or either in jail or someone would shoot him
but now hes grown up to their surprise
big daddy got a hit record selling worldwide
now the same people that didnt like him as a child
be saying can i borrow a dollar ooh youre a star now

when i was a teenager i wanted to be down
with a lot of mcdjing crews in town
so in school on nobel street i say can i be down champ
they said no and treated me like a wet food stamp
after getting rejected i was very depressed
sat and wrote some def doodoo rhymes at my rest
when i used to come to parties theyd make me pay
i would have to beg to get on the mic and rap that day
i was never into girls i was just into my music
they acted like i wanted to keep it instead of trying to use it
but now things switched without belief

i thought my political views might ruin this
i figured you mightve moved on to these newer kids
my extra extended hiatuses
who wouldve thought you woulda let me get away with this
i mean no ones waiting to see what an aging hater thinks
i kinda wanted to be finished
i didnt wanna pull my heart out let you see in it
i just wanna grow privately be free a minute
plus my soul dont always have peace within it
i tell the truth but i can see that im conceded with it
i make a whole lot of mistakes please dont be offended
i used to have this recurring nightmare
im on stage with the whole city inside here
i start choking and my lungs wont provide air
then i dropped an album they reacted to it
started selling out first avenue
now all the bad dreams i have are that you no longer care for dude
 sample
keep in my mind that im an artist
and im sensitive about my shit thats right
sensitive about my shit
keep in my mind that im an artist
and im sensitive about my shit say that then
sensitive about my shit

i love rappers with the big voices
they put the power in their lyrics so you live for it
and spit it boisterous the ignorant cant ignore it
i put the preachers style in my delivery
and i remember vividly somebody tweeted chuck d
and asked him who the best voices are and he mentioned me
i did seven shows a week for like five years
and used to scream on that mic to make it sound clearer
now im staring down my most profound fear
started catching up with my vocal cords
im not so sure that i should perform no more
back of my mind wonder what youre applauding for
 sample
keep in my mind that im an artist
and im sensitive about my shit feel like the wrestler
sensitive about my shit
keep in my mind that im an artist yes maam
and im sensitive about my shit
sensitive about my shit

huh flying to new york to do some press
i just imagine that these people wont be too impressed
the loot he getting all at once is how they view success
but then the writers like brother ali sir
ive been so excited just for writing this feature
he asking all these dope questions and did his research
and then i meet the editor and staff
and everybody got their cell phone camera to flash
and a story about how my music helped em in the past
i gotta ask yall an honest question
i mean im beyond honored by this warm reception
but since you got respect and an obvious connection
and every time you bless us with the tiniest little speck
of an online mention our fans all shower you with affection
and just blow up your comment section
well what the hell i mean i aint complaining
but how come you dont place us in the hiphop conversation
they just look back with blank faces
 sample
keep in my mind that im an artist
and im sensitive about my shit that joint got awkward fast
sensitive about my shit
keep in my mind that im an artist
and im sensitive about my shit
sensitive about my shit

i dont usually use those big words
cause i dont usually deal with big people
i find you can get a whole lot of small people
and whip hell out of a whole lot of big people

murder murder murder kill kill kill
cannibals walk the earth and get ill blood spill
eyes sunk deep in their skull their bone chill
few for survival most for the thrill
terrorism is the war of the poor
hold up a mirror so the script get flipped
cause when its in reverse it aint wrong no more
warfares the terrorism of the rich
whos the true guerilla
when the bomb on your body killing innocent civilians
but a life is a life and a killer is a killer
youre at a desk chillin push a button kill a million
see the anguish of the parents
when theyre carrying the body of the baby that they cherish
when innocent people perish
its a very thin line between a soldier and a terrorist

murder murder kill kill kill
death and destruction a cap get pealed
harm or heal destroy and rebuild
shots still ring out and blood still spill

overseas we can mutilate and mangle
let me give you an example what our troops are coming back to
cold cities where the youth are getting strangled
the community in peril and our future looking narrow
your school already failed you
the boys in blue will nail you they salute you with a barrel
the streets are a certified dead zone
decorated with chalk lines and headstones
all the way live and every night the bullets flying
even if you aint dying you a traumatized survivor
when you grow up in a climate of overriding violence
you will never get beyond it itll always alive inside you
and death just surrounds you
fallen classmates ghosts haunt you
crime just calls you cause you look at what you walk through
aint certain if youll make it aint sure you even want to

murder murder kill kill kill
death and destruction a cap get pealed
harm or heal destroy and rebuild
shots still ring out and blood still spill
murder murder kill kill kill
death and destruction a cap get pealed
harm or heal destroy and rebuild
shots still ring out and blood still spill

tears and sorrow block the sunlight
head low heart broke eyes closed tonguetied
waters raise the tide is climbing
speeding time the sky is crying
shots are fired bombs and sirens
war and riots mourning in america

now that society forgot you
and they locked you in an obstacle course where nothings possible
if you slip up and they caught you
they got boxes where they lock you make a million dollars off you
they rule you too rude to school
they screw you in a booth shoot electricity through you
or inject death into you
on a television set and let it ooze through you
every time a leader tries to stand up for our freedom
someone claps them with the heater their brain and back leaking
a shame their family grieving the only way to see them
is a displaced dream displayed in a museum
they say they built our nation for a reason
then they stained it with the bleeding of the slaves that never seen it
i aint hating i still want to believe it
and im not trying to leave it i just call it how i see it

murder murder kill kill kill
death and destruction a cap get pealed
harm or heal destroy and rebuild
shots still ring out and blood still spill
they havent got anything to lose
and theyve got everything to gain
and theyll let you know in a minute
it takes two to tango when i go you go

now baby you gon get a crook in your neck looking at me sideways
i play high stakes made crook in a crime wave
must be something on my face
yelling out that youre not telling what they spelling on myspace dot com
bold type face rhetoric
you gon clickety click and get your head split
what the hell you look like on a message board
discussing whether or not the brother is hard core
i aint got to prove to any of you
that anything i ever said was is the truth but im ready to do it
and do it leisurely ant give ten beats a week
so fuck it ill put the record how it needs to be
i understand i aint perfect alright
i been a thugged out nerd all my life
thank god i aint got to serve dirt or snatch purses at night
i feed people with the verses i write
and i fill them with my personal strife
had some of yall concerned for my life
for what ive had the nerve to recite
i cut my grass low bring the surface to light
now baby you aint never heard me im tight
and im surgical like with this bitch
jake you know that shit fuck around and get a closed casket and im old fashioned
trying to figure how we got from whipper whip to this silly bullshit
its just so tragic
but it aint impossible to solve
i aint learned jack shit from dorian at all

ill come across the hall and get involved like this here

im just here to play my part and inbetween scenes got to stay on guard
i aint way out yall you just dont get me dog

tabernacle my hand expand to the size of a big black granite statue

but that aint my problem with you
truth is youre just an impossible dude
you get hostile with fools when theyre honest with you
i could make me a snide little comment or two
but i dont see what that nonsense would prove
i dont give fake props to the dude or walk around in his shoes
i just do what the quran says to do and respect him

i said clap your hand to the beat yall

i dont want to see you in a screen
i want to feel you in the flesh and on the scene
i love all the words and what it mean
but its so much to say in the spaces in between
i dont want to watch dots disappear
listen here first reaction is crystal clear
i want the uncut sentiment
before you had a chance to second guess and edit it
i love you for the first draft you
all the technology on earth cant improve
no special effects and no santa claus
uncut acoustic and analog
a lifetime measured in breaths
the face is a mirror that the heart reflects
and when the eyes meet they directly connect
and thats what you call true special effects

staring at your picture hanging nicely on the wall
longing to be near you because life is way too short
i traveled through the night til morning light broke through the storm
just to see your face again just to see your face
staring at your picture hanging nicely on the wall
longing to be near you because life is way too short
i traveled through the night til morning light broke through the storm
just to see your face again

i dont want to watch your life in pictures
im trying to be right there with ya
well be so rich at the end of all of this
we can scroll through memories without any filter
im trying to share life as it comes
no timeline from the night to the sun
crème de la crème and the crust and the crumbs
type of love you cant type with your thumbs
let me not hear your voice in a speaker
im tryna feel your breath when it leaves ya
message received you best to believe
your real life friend is requesting to see you
im here to watch your story unfold
i dont really want to only be told
everything i hold is pressed to my chest
thats what you call special effects yes

staring at your picture hanging nicely on the wall
longing to be near you because life is way too short
i traveled through the night til morning light broke through the storm
just to see your face again just to see your face
staring at your picture hanging nicely on the wall
longing to be near you because life is way too short
i traveled through the night til morning light broke through the storm
just to see your face again just to see your face again

into me you see i see
inherent in here i hear
i give fidelity free

into me you see i see
inherent in here i hear my dear
just to see your face again just to see your face

groove to the beat that free your mind state
put your heartbeat on vibrate
in other words what
in other words huh
move to the beat that free your mind state
put your heartbeat on vibrate
in other words what
in other words huh

a question was raised to me the other day
why it seem i always have joy
well id like to take time to set the record straight
all the joy ive ever known
has disappeared
 into motherfuckin thin air
like its never even been there
my joy left me yall

gods rain water flow through the same gutter
that we walk today gotta stay brave brother
keep your lips stiff keep your fist clenched
at times you gotta kick your way through this bitch

and i cant stop feelin guilty smilin
a wise man once told me that every cloud has a silver lining
i wanted to believe him but its a trick to find em
when the people around me continue dying
granddad was in the twilight of his life
when he closed his eyes tight and opened his wrists wide
what make a tenth round fighter with the winning score
decide he need to throw the towel before the whistle blow
maybe ill never know
but i inherited his poetic soul so the symbolisms yet to show
was life so obscene that deaths more serene
or was an old author tryin to write his own closing scene
nothing stings like knowing that the woman that gave me this life
is being eaten from the inside
i thought we never make shit right
i wish id have viewed it once clear before you were done here
thats two in one year that i let leave here
loving me without shedding one single tear
either im one of the strongest people left
or yall should stone me for even tryin to steal breath

and gods rain water flow through the same gutter
that we walk today gotta stay brave brother
keep your lips stiff keep your fist clenched
at times you gotta kick your way through this bitch

they say shits strapped but you all by yourself aint ya
damn straight i got a jail cell nature
been boxed up but i never been settled in
him got tough started developing leather skin
i learned to make that face that tells predators
its better to reassess just who you bout to wrestle with
im on one like the first kick drum of the beat
clear my lungs spit blood on the street
they telling me we got nothin to fear but fear itself
but i fear i have no human fear left
some day im gonna wanna peel back these calluses
and really feel life again and thats what my challenge is
i been kickin and bitin for so long and
when they throw me a rescue rope ill be too weary to hold on
and see the light so i sing through the tears
in the key of life the way a wounded eagle might

and gods rain water flow through the same gutter
that we walk today gotta stay brave brother
keep your lips stiff keep your fist clenched
at times you gotta kick your way through this bitch
my joy left me yall
she dont show her face around these parts
every time she come she get chased off
so she stay distant

if it wasnt for me squintin he wouldnt know the sun was out
i hate every word that come outta his fuckin mouth
ladies treat him special dont know nothin bout him
they saw what his wife see they wouldnt fuss bout him
he cant do shit right but rap and make babies
and babies need daddy at home consistent
but rap keep daddy on the road religious
so even in my two loves my souls so conflicted
my son came into this world innocent
he deserves everything that he needs to live in it
and this home i made for him is broken
im hopin his love for me will never grow thin
it hurts daddy to no end to know when
youre cryin at the hospital im out tryin to rock a show
i made a vow that wed never be broke again
and id never be a burden on another friend
so when im sweatin on my farewell stage
and wrote my last hook in my last rhyme book
when i get my last line of approval from my family
this is the man that i have to be

and gods rain water flow through the same gutter
that we walk today gotta stay brave brother
keep your lips stiff keep your fist clenched
at times you gotta kick your way through this bitch
sometimes
i feel
like im almost gone

somebody told me that the im the truth
dont worry about it get down with me and ah
well set you free 
hit it

yeah yeah
gone in a swing like that right there
yeah ah
i want everybody to jump out their seats
and start clappin your hands

rhymesayer entertain try to name a better team
reveal your jealous aim some thingsll never change
best twang your family together mayne
them people cellophane allowin their mother name
im invincible walk with my word and my balls and my principles
like a true prince should do
only givin you a little bitty glimpse of truth
as i live it through imagine what im fittin to do
i aint that hit it and quit it dude
live it for that minute then split and im here to get residual
pedal hard and settle not for even a notch
between the premium spot cream of the crop
believe it or not im over every line like one
life changin moment at a time
please trust youll find no better design
im so justified im boast of epic kind
nose to the grind stone wait no never mind
i could tell you til im blue in the face the end of time
if you was ever gon bear witness to the child
then your ass probably wouldve been admitted by now

so now ah come now walk with me
i think and i walk and i talk awkwardly
if when you gotta see in order to believe
then your ass must be blind none strong as me ali
ah come now walk with me
i think and i walk and i talk honestly
i show strangers what they ought not to see
but thats just our nature none strong as we ha

call me slug thats it dont need no acronyms
tryin to keep the masochist tucked inside the pacificist
but god its gettin hard to give em passes when
they act as if they came up on the south side of nazareth
cant imagine this its like a beauty pageant
where them models project and serve the law of averageness
coat hanger on the mic rappin mannequins
stash em out behind the garage where the trash be in
dont go and get mad i aint your daddy kid
and you not ant so why you tryin to sample this
so pop your little titties out ego expandin
them shenanigansll catch a free ride up in that ambulance
cant fix them damages with bandages
another midlife crisis tryin to brag on all the ass you get
cash it in and take a look at who you dancin with
you just a middle man between the fiends and your management
minneapolis takes the passion with
a twist of lemon cause im on some old fashioned shit
so tell anakin we lookin for orlando with
coach and the champion go fix a couple sandwiches

yeah come now walk with me
i think and i walk and i talk awkwardly
if when you gotta see in order to believe
then your ass must be blind none strong as me ali
ah come now walk with me
i think and i walk and i talk honestly
i show strangers what they ought not to see
but thats just my nature none strong as we come on

used to raise babies in a funky old dirty place
so i kept me a snub nosed thirtyeight
took it to the pawn shop on the first and paid
rent with it didnt want to send em to the pearly gates
in the clutch of the beat drop
see me hop up off the sheetrock and strut like a peacock
get your teeth knocked clean out your speech box
must not believe that meets the grease part
i wrote god a love letter with street chalk
fell through potato chips could of put beach hut
and there i stood in all of my splendor
til i did believe i told em everything that i meant to

come down now come now walk with me
i think and i walk and i talk awkwardly
if when you gotta see in order to believe
then your ass must be blind none strong as me ali
ah come down walk with me
i think and i walk and i talk honestly
i show strangers what they ought not to see
but thats just our nature none strong as we ah
get get get get get get get down

whats crackelackin dog
thats gonna be so tight 
i know
 
i hear you i hear too 
yeah me too dog me too
hook til fade

fuck kill and prosper
is the gospel of wonderland where
street sands are quick
to suck you down to the abyss
with the lure of pure bliss if you kiss the dicks
of the niggas never nosferatus
those witches and warlocks in blue
government gumshoe keepers of the first zoo
who  me 
im the modern day vixen vampire slayer
unauthorized player in the capitalist contest
to see who gets money
no milk and honey in this land
cause justice has been banned
so its play dirty or die by the hand
thats holding all the guns
plunged deep into religion was my first decision
to save me and my daughters lives but
i cant thrive off spirit and scripture
the picture grew clearer i made the move to rear her
in a life wanting for nothing
so i got into this drug thing
not doing but dealing
sealing fates and healing struggle gaped wounds
of the doomed became my mission
izm was just too small time
i had to find the best design to
fuck with the massive motherfuckers minds and pockets
so i sold cock hits and alleyway thigh splits for two bits
and five year old preschool pussy
and once strong now bony backs and stretched out
weary racks of snatch in other words
 i sold crack
morality was buried deep beneath the new jeep
silk sheets and money heaps
still the good mother i sent my daughter off to
boarding school to keep shit under cover
all the while envisioning myself a champion of ghetto causes
plus his game i was playing and winning
while sinning against myself and soul to get the gold
i was the female don the crack queen
to me i seemed unstoppable my coffers full
i went buckwild wanting more
like the pipe worn whores i began to deplore
no time for playing with my coochie
counting my mans mad lucci
while he was up inside some hoochies loose piece
i signed the checks and i counted out the cash
wasnt saving ass for no niggas sent upriver
i thought my shit was tight
 til my empire started to quiver
taking every chance under surveillance being listened to
and watched like assata shakur
my place on the top was no more sure
loose lips flipped the script
the fantasy trip swiftly ended
it took no time to blend in with the population prison
my jaded vision busted like a cherry
every dream i had now tainted bad
i fucked and i killed to prosper
upheld each tenant of the ghastly gospel
shift to a different wonderland to pay the price for my vice
a land of fields to toil in like slaves
no lillies in this field just plenty of souls to save
plenty of fat uniformed rats with
below average size cocks that slither
through cell locks in the night
lactating tits being licked left and right
plenty of coochie burning with desire
like black churches in the south
black prayers and pussy on fire
penned up behind barbed wire
me and my fellow female mammals animals
bitches in cages bodies racked with hormone rages
minds haunted by our childrens faces
they mace us with promises of rehabilitation slash corruption
place smoking guns in empty hands of native sisters and sons
i joined in this nations favorite pasttime
on a quest to gets mine
now im passing time standing on line
in the commissary to buy maxipads
instead of shopping at barneys for chanel bags
nana who raised me went to bed adazed
via my mistakes and my daughter hates
me for what i did
and im fucked and im stuck
doing the devils bid
being locked in a moral corrupt crib
psst missing my kid psst hey girl
you wanna get finger fucked tonight
i swear ill stick it in and up tight just right
yo sis ive had to kill and shit
just blow my head pretty and ill give you a slip

where slugs fly thugs cry cause every part of its gritty
niggas shooting up the club like they party with diddy

and in essence i can burn one thousand joules of energy per second
i put them on to lessons while im smoking on the blessing
the switch hitter like pete rose right up the session

to stop giving me the silent treatment baby
cant you see what you mean to me
i wanna love you constantly but you keep neglecting me
and treating me silently

yo i had a queen named amina height fiftyseven
caramelcomplected body like heaven
met her through the sister of my man big vince
like something from out the flicks we been in love ever since
she called me her chocolate brother i call her my sugar sister
knew shorty could work it since before i ever kissed her
i never dissed her painted my picture to hit
but because sex she wasnt with she started flipping and shit
like listen man im queen amina aminas not no freak and
that game is weak and keep trying to hit i could quit speaking
tariq in fact you bein black thought dont get you closer
i dig ya but wont bone ya because im socalled supposed to
most o them would but that couldnt be me thats not my flavor
go home and think about that maybe later on ill page ya
i contemplated and then concluded she was bluffing
steady pursuing screwing getting nothing but the silent treatment

crazy frustration about my loving situation
when patience was a virtue but i wasnt used to waiting
i want some marvin gaye healing feeling is real inside
i slip and slide my ridell keep you occupied id
love to get with it like that but my babys kitty cats capped
and locked love boat is docked at the shore
and what for later for groupies on tour
why wont my sugar call me no more
i mean my queen gets upset rejectin and sexually neglect
then sayin im more sewer than das efx and closedminded
its like im blinded by the skinning
im into women because of that this ones into
communication temptation played the vandal
freaking my brain my mind ripping the handle on physically scandalous
acts yo she knew what i wanted but she fronted
bust it

well umm
moving right along with the song plus the strong
feelings on my mind desire to intertwine
combine and blend baby bust a message that i send
aint no need to pretend cause shit is real til the end
i provide a place to hide from crime hard times
and living trife while i open your mind youre in my life
like love it aint no way no one can rise above
whats real thats why im feeling like youre making me bugged
i puff an el on fifty deuce while i walk in the rain
heart feeling killer pain while i hop the train
dial her number to the rest and aint no messages left
regardless my chest thumps from stress yo its a mess
i dont know what i got to do to make you understand
im for real and thats no question no fronting or no guessing
undressing caressing in the span that i contain in my hand
could touch and make you say that im such a man
and call my name so let me set your body aflame
ill never treat you like a dame or run game
now whos to blame
i know youre not a ho for niggas with a lot of dough
but i just wanted you to know

i dont care as long as the basslines pumpin
the drumline bangin away
make one move and ill blow you away
one false move and ill blow you away

yo i dont really know but somebody said
that the og flow it could fuck witcha head
and the police know that the green black and red
too strong to control they study what i said
dig it my name is riq and when im on the mic
im known to spit somethin that these mcs hate
i couldnt care less what you feel what you say
cause i gotta put it to you in my own special way
im a monster
you know im certified sick
i came from the corner where nobody got shit
took the cards i was dealt turned it into hot spit
now im not only a passenger im in the cockpit
been a long time comin i was caught in the scramble
of cats tryin to do the same thing that they man do
eagles born to fly rivers made to ramble
a dangerous mind im a prime example

superfans wanna run up on me sparkin the ground up
you need to fall back could be narcs around us
you in a hot area for marchin powder
if you holdin chowder just walk without it
them real crook brothers dont talk about it
they never make a move til they thought shit out kid
i knew a lot of men who did bids for mayhem
they made a lot of money they money never made them
the game of survival is filled with rivals
knives and fofive slugs flyin in spirals
the wicked is diseased and it aint all viral
could be greed and gluttony bubblin inside you
dawg follow your pride the rhythmll guide you
yo follow them guys them niggasll rob you
and have you up in somethin that dont really involve you
but you dont give a fuck you wanna pump the volume i know

yo aiyyo the waistline thumpin the face kinda jumpin
the game lookin sweeter than a bassline bumpin

they shut shit down before the law start shuttin
get your route right cousin
be out nightclubbin relaxed
and wanna get lights out tonight brother perhaps

fighting the truth trying to hide
but i think its alright girl
yeah i think its alright girl ooh
shes falling in love now losing control now
fighting the truth trying to hide
but i think its alright girl
yeah i think its alright girl ooh

shes falling but she doesnt think hell catch her
cause her last relationship was a disaster
accusations everyday she didnt know why
all her calls would be ignored hes on his own time
shouldve ended it before it started
all she ever got was broken hearted
he was cheating on her trying to flip it
back on her like a victim
now she all alone and starting over
now she got baggage on her shoulder
but the new guy really loves her
she loves him but she doesnt trust herself anymore

shes falling in love now losing control now
fighting the truth trying to hide
but i think its alright girl
yeah i think its alright girl ooh
shes falling in love now losing control now
fighting the truth trying to hide
but i think its alright girl
yeah i think its alright girl ooh

despite her past she cant help the attraction
he tells her that hes nothing like the last one
he redefines in every way what love is
she fell for him and hasnt gotten up since
every now and then she goes off though
beating on his chest like a bongo
he understands shes coming from a hurt place
answers all the questions on her survey
doesnt get jealous doesnt break trust
doesnt call her hoe after hangups
give her everything she ever wanted
and even though she still feels haunted

shes falling in love now losing control now
fighting the truth trying to hide
but i think its alright girl
yeah i think its alright girl ooh
shes falling in love now losing control now
fighting the truth trying to hide

killer queens the borough new york be the city
coming crazy out your mouth will get your split up like a philly
running through the maze like im willie you gotta feel me

eyes blurry from the smoke i cant see the lane
swerving heavy bottle in my lap
im looking for a problem so im modeling the gat
somebody save me cause i dont wanna go to jail
id rather be up in the mansion for the polo sale
but im here stuck inside my thoughts
im tryna have a bag of money stuffed inside my shorts

my life is like a movie blizzard with the shottie
hookah house on roosie chilling in the lobby
yes im living gnarly the forty ounce of barley
open up cigars and fill em with a bunch of marley
double cut porterhouse straight from lugers
ruger for intruders hand to hand made by the duelers
ginger ale in knicks glasses your style is piss mothafucka
time to flip the mattress kick it swift as cassius
my mind is stronger than mariusz pudzianows
obvious to see im a star straight off the couch
you rapping with a blouse you get slapped up side the mouth
by the zangief lookalike bronson always cooking right
spray the vinegar to tighten up a yummy
smoking got me squinting like the sky is high and sunny
attachment on the nozzle make the iron fire funny
never stop until my body diving in a pile of money

im always smoking like a gunshot
you know the fuzzy light green call it dunlop flow nuns twat
many hours one man standing one spot
from the morning to the mothafuckin sun drop
cause im one with the earth eyes red
mothafucka ive been blunted since birth age nine
mom dukes kept the gun in the purse next to the hair spray
fuck tomorrow money coming in the fast way

i finally found love and its fucking beautiful
i no longer bite my nails down to the cuticles no more
my sex stories aint suitable for listeners
cause prisoners to wack off aw man yo chill chill chill chill
enough of that soft shit me by myself is like the four horsemen
youre just a poor sportsman your sports car could be your coffin
the thought of revenge release endorphins
that make me feel just like im swimming with some dolphins god damn
ring ring for this i gotta call em baby shit i might retire
spend the rest of my days down in new orleans maybe
money changed me for the better
so i brought it back and got the all black jetta
with the header and the leather bra
thinking back like shit dog you really set the bar
high as fuck bout to twist another
too many people gone damn we miss our brothers
what the fuck is going on a strange sense ah
somethings going wrong i can feel it in my fingers man shit
a strong scent lingers
somethings going wrong i can feel it in my fingers
like arthritis when its raining uh

let it rain on me
let it rain

it only took me nine times to make a debut tenth times a charm shit true
now mans on road that means im hard
charge whatever on the visa card half moon caesar parts
a lot of motherfuckers blind they couldnt see the art
war stories throw em through a stack of tables
wrap my body in a stack of bibles cause shit could get dangerous
bam bam splash off the turn buckle splash
now you no longer have to use your nerves or muscles
well see who loves me if i need a liver shit
you feel defenseless in the presence of a stripper shit
you cannot be trusted with the access to the money
i crash more benzes than when they practice with the dummies
i make these bastards look funny bugs bunny pussy
i make these bastards look funny bugs bunny bugs bunny
uh yeah these motherfuckers must be crazy cause i aint going nowhere
until im called up to the stars then ill go there

but for now im asking ladies like whats up tonight
baby whats up tonight
yeah whats up tonight

i got the true religion jean suit
gunit sneaker shit
ah

get money dont be no lame
bench warmers never ride foreign so play the game
never drop the ball never accept a loss
get back up if you fall and when yo number called
you better give yo all
i hope you give yo all
you gotta play until the end
the only diff between a winner and a loser is a winner plays until he wins

aint nothing for free so get yo ass up
my partner scared if we dont speed then they might pass us
so we hit eightyfive tryna keep this dream alive
all i see is green i think these screens is fucking with my sight
nowadays hoes claiming that they crushin
bop a darling in my bucket til their heads catch concussions
but please dont push my buttons i dont know you like that
cant do no favors for these haters i dont owe you like that
well i guess its the allure like when you need to score
one second on the clock and the shots all yours
hit or miss we take the risk
cause anything is better than viennas and warm grits
trading bustitbabies for fly divas that buck
her only concern is if my car match her clutch
yeah shes a gold digger but that pussy good
so what the fuck dont be late for this players ball
hurry up and

get money dont be no lame
bench warmers never ride foreign so play the game
never drop the ball never accept a loss
get back up if you fall and when yo number called
you better give yo all
i hope you give yo all
you gotta play until the end
the only diff between a winner and a loser is a winner plays until he wins

they told me life is what you make it
so what you been creating on your free time
ill lend you bars if you need rhyme or reason
some people change its a part of life like seasons
just be aware that everybody aint your friend
theyll be gone with the wind once your jump shot dont go in
or your acl torn and youre a couple yards short
from a super bowl championship and it was down four
gotta play the field be willing to ride willing to dive
for what you desire call your pop fly but never collide
with other players that play the game
dont be eager to run with crowds stay in your lane
pass this knowledge on to your team but carry the flame
cause its yours and yours alone to brighten your way
put god first and free your soul
cause even olympic runners sometimes lose their gold
so

get money dont be no lame
bench warmers never ride foreign so play the game
never drop the ball never accept a loss
get back up if you fall and when yo number called
you better give yo all
i hope you give yo all
you gotta play until the end
the only diff between a winner and a loser is a winner plays until he wins

let the shot spark soon as his pit bull barks
tire scars from skid marks leaves from jams in school parks
witness forget his original statement
even in protection programs theres no escapement
gunned down three in town hit king from seven crowns
spent rounds catch him while he rhyme in the zebra lounge
wounded back in the eightythree summer heat
up in three hundred and nine park rhyming off the drummers beat
i stalk the city streets demonstrating mic wrecks
all looking stank i aint playing with a full deck
and as they nervously stare i know they scared
they saw the coming of wu in neon in times square
household name assassin killa bee
mill to the grain that posses the wu trilogy
quick to spot those that bite camouflage and blend
those that got styles they got identical twins
dont stretch the small thing copycats are finicky
without skills they master the art of mimicry
but i go line for line on the whole page
your unspotted life on the mic is old age

dhani harrison  john frusciante play guitars

the joy the flowers bring me
the pain still has me sinking
all while my heart gently weeps
your smile has got me shrinking
the tears in your eyes are twinkling
because the heart gently weeps

sellin base smokin bones in the staircase
though i dont know why i chose to smoke sess
i guess thats the time when im not depressed
but im still depressed and i ask whats it worth
ready to give up so i seek the old earth
who explained workin hard may help you maintain
to learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
we got stickup kids corrupt cops and crack rocks
and stray shots all on the block that stays hot
leave it up to me while i be livin proof
to kick the truth to the young black youth

knew this kid named ronnie used to make cash with caesar
they made a lot of money back in the eightys crack fever
caesar was an overachiever a kingpin and eighteenandahalf
he got knocked and left ronnie to watch the team and the stash
plus his crib his jewels his whip and his girl
and ronnies selfinterests had him livin in a different world
he rocked caesars chains he pushed caesars range
smokin mad wools all day with caesars change
not to mention he pushed up on caesars wifey

heres a bulletin from state police princeton junction
the militia
certain individuals of unidentified nature
is now under complete control
hiphop is not what it is today
its the real echoes its the militia

if heads only knew how i felt about the rap game
theyd relocate and change their fuckin name
i eradicate move fakers roll with coat shakers
give dap to mad money makers
shared cells with life takers have sex with rump shakers
i make moves so imma earthquaker
ive been known to instill fear
although the world may be round we still trapped in the square
city light got me buggin and trife
some die by the gun some die by the knife
its all right like a game of spades im trump tight
premier hit me with music to ensure that it thump right
and my flight will be taken solely at night
cause thats when the freaks come out no doubt
and in the dark hours is when i will shower
with the knowledge of my trade to get paid
still i make moves like a snake in the grass roundabout
i be dickin it down while you be assed out
puff mad ls but never passed out
and if im caught up in a jam i blast my way out
therell be no lettin up just straight shuttin up
or well start the wettin up
lyrical infrared sceptor never miss you
big shug guru freddie foxxx the militia militia

everybodys spittin it the rhyme is hot
cause its big shug guru and freddie the foxxx
when premier bring the beats no it just dont stop

yo i aint one to succumb to no man but to command
and scoop up the troops when its time to take a stand
emphatically deep strategies leave casualties
i creep gradually til everybody knows
that i got more flows than rosebud got hoes
the anger inside had me trapped
til i got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
for big stacks watch your back when i send em in
caught you tremblin my name and face youre rememberin
several attempts but nah bitch youll never win
rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs well be severin
take you to the mat peep that you should keep back
my illkid format will lay you flat like a doormat
that i walk on i meditate while you talk on
and gossip so i drop my hot shit fully loaded glock clips
so get the fuck out my block kid
as nights turn to days days go back to nights we be speaking it right
and keeping it tight up in the street life
i meet life head on no holds barred
born with a heart of gold now mostly cold and scarred
en guard choose your weapon or get to steppin
lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
assessments are made before and during combat
i master my hunger blow the spot when i bomb cats
one of us equals many of us
disrespect one of us youll see plenty of us
conflict is what i predict
you and your fellas is mad jealous attempting to flare
we cleverly stalked ya your famll miss ya
the wars on thats why we formed the militia

everybodys spittin it the rhyme is hot
cause its big shug guru and freddie the foxxx
when premier bring the beats no it just dont stop
its the militia

you niggas owe me for my rhymes i come to collect
for you dope fiend niggas in rap i here to inject check
my style is butter baby spread it around
but when you niggas dont flow it right and fuck up my sound
i get down in eightynine i spit a buck in the face
of every mc that came in the place a scar youll never erase
mcs are only recognized for their flows

for all them faking ass niggas and how i bust up their nose
and while your nose is drippin and drainin blood
ill be standing over you screamin nigga what what nigga what

gloria gaynor on you motherfuckers i will survive
you can try to come at me but do you want the kick back
you step inside the cage of a pit and you get bit back huh
my war is so tight my drama so ill
beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
i push these lyrics through any mc and make it burn
so the niggas who be rhyming next will miss a turn
when you speak of whos the dopest mc i dont come up
but when you speak of whos the livest mc i stay one up whats up
i got stripes like you got strikes and bogus mikes
do what bitch niggas do best  bite
yall niggas cant make up a law that i dont overrule overthrow
preem brought bumpy this track so ima let you know
before i slide imma leave you this jewel
even mechanics walk around with they tools
its the militia

so many things will happen that one cant explain
you find yourself saying why me time and again
they say what goes around comes around
ahun so think about it while youre messing up clown
a mothers love and a fathers concern
here is the reason you should listen and learn
cause quick schemes and fast living can kill ya
i know how the excitement and danger can thrill ya
but take it from somebody who knows
cause after all the highs youre gonna feel all the lows
this is why knowledge of self is essential
cause if you dont have it you may simply go mental
see life is not a thing to be toyed wit
cause every second another dream is destroyed wit
the systematic plan devised to erase us
and straight to hell is where theyre trying to take us
but never fold and hold back your fears
have a strong mind and try to say your prayers

stick up kids is out to tax
and this is how the story goes

brothers are amused by others brothers reps
but the thing they know best is where the gun is kept
cause in the night youll feel fright
and at the sight of a fourfifth i guess you just might
wanna do a dance or two
cause they could maybe bust you for self or with a crew
no matter if you or your brothers a star
he could pop you and jet without a getaway car
and some might say that hes a dummy
but hes sticking you and taking all of your money
its a daily operation
he might be loose in the park or lurking at the train station
mad brothers know his name
so he thinks he got a little fame from the stickup game
and while were blaming society
hes at a party with his man
they got their eye on the gold chain that the next mans wearing
it looks big but they aint staring
just thinking of a way and when to get the brother
theyll be long gone before the kid recovers
and back around the way hell have the chain on his neck
claiming respect just to get a rep

ten brothers in a circle had the kid trapped
the one with the hoodie said well hurt you
if you dont run all your jewels and pay
give up the rolex watch or you wont see another day
see they were on the attack
and one said yo you wanna make this to a homicide rap
make it fast so we can be on our way
kick in the rings and everything ok
the kid was nervous and flinching
and little shorty with the thirtyeight yo he was inching
closer and closer put the gun to his head
shorty was down to catch a body instead
money was scared so he panicked
took off his link and his rings and ran frantic
but shorty said nah pulled the trigger and stepped
it was nothing he did it just to get a rep

the rep grows bigger now hes known for his trigger finger
rolling with troops of his sons like a gangster figure
hes near the peak of his crazy career

everything they say is irrelevant
im an element of rap that defines pure elegance
elevating my residence bigging them up
im in the hood rocking jmt shit in the truck
not i against i because i dont sleep on my stomach
i rock heavy metal kings and watch the barrel of the gun twitch
youre talking dumb shit hooting and hollering
i lift the cannon and wait for the bazooka to swallow them
imma do this regardless of them im the original
dirty rotten scoundrel surrounding your pinnacle
block the perimeter ill hit you with the fadeaway
got a bullet with your name on it for a rainy day

so many days so many nights

and in the lab everything was constructed with stoupe
and yall know that no one fuckin with us as a group

when all the light goes out where will you be
when the darkness comes what will you see

i carry heavy fists im a biological terrorist
if you aint been in war then you dont know what terror is
you try to help people but do nothin like therapists
its basic rules to the game cousin you never snitch
or you can see the type of lead that my beretta spits
or take you through the torture chamber and behead the bitch
yeah ill put your body to the blades and choppers
and teach you about the disruptive symbol of chakras
if you believe what they tellin you the beast and them won
thats why i speak about survival and need for a gun
i stand for what them thugs is repping
but they dont know the government is usin drugs as weapons
and drug injections was taught by the prophets before
about the cavalry of shadowy prophets of war
its hard to grip so i spit it at a different degrees
but the inner earth holds more water than seas

whos gonna save you when all the lights go out
its time to reconcile how you gonna go how you gonna go
when the lights go out when the lights go out
when the lights go out how you gonna go oh oh oh

when i was a little kid my mother told me not to stare into the sun so once when i was six i did the doctors didnt know if my eyes would ever heal i was terrified alone in that darkness slowly daylight crept in through the bandages and i could see but something else had changed inside of me

im the fire bearer holder of the sun
the earth and the universe combined as one
an everlasting energy taking all forms
blue skies on sunny days terrible storms
the one who tears down what you adorn
and curses the material things that you mourn
but look up in the sky because i am the dawn
and the light that empowers your flesh as you yawn
strong undeniably so lif better known as a society foe
the deity glow reach into my center
i bet you feel pleasure and pain as you enter
the tormentor pleaser embracer squeezer
as your skeleton crush your physical turns into gelatin plus
due to over stimuli you liquify
i send you back to the earth soil to quench the turmoil
when the ground splits to swallow of corporations and cops
give birth to rocks so we can have solid ground on which to walk
stand strong and talk and write down theories in chalk on the side walk

the devil lurks and my heart irks for the hell
look into the eyes of a nigga who fell
the devil lurks and my heart irks for the hell
look into the eyes of the

my style orbits round nine planets of forces
ominous metaphorics envision a devil corpses
lion hoarder mad scientist slash author
present the type of horror that boils your holy water
get warped with the knowledge that folds the holy father
hard boys become toys inside the real saga
so why bother my whole floor alliance is harder
so bring the drama we all know that science is smarter
i set off crowds style wild like a circus
i seek new souls when i walk past churches
allah praise you stay true to a devout purpose
seeking out the wise wherever the god searches
flows that i embark on leave your squadron shadow dodging
lyrics assault men like slugs that fill harkness
no option narrow odds
fucking with gods is straight gambling with your tarot cards

the devil lurks and my heart irks for the hell
look into the eyes of a nigga who fell
the devil lurks and my heart irks for the hell
look into the eyes of the

open the gates of midian for the fangs like the flesh
three cyborgs who bang like ladesh
we hang the best spit venom until your face burn
yet the critics are parasitic like a tape worm
the hate burn scathe the nerve of a buddhist
snake turn and fake yearns the kiss of judas
we take lives with knives steady abusing you
with the vicious intentions of denting your uvula
bruising you with text of a harvard class
ikon will smash into shards of glass
to reform into a whirlwind of sand
then reborn into the world hologram
a solemn man with plans to entwine matter
minds splatter from the grind of my divine hammer

the devil lurks and my heart irks for the hell
look into the eyes of a nigga who fell
the devil lurks and my heart irks for the hell
look into the eyes of the

just heard shots by the dust town and turn around and see your brother jump outta fresh towns
before he fucked the world cause its a cold bitch
with no panties on and some wet lips
and she licked her lips and stared at me

pussy lips that you wanna pop the peel off
two stepping with my rear bottom heels on
lady in the streets but a whore in the bed
tricks with the head make him spend more bread
little boys get treated like sex toys
fuck him in his mouth yet he run and tell his homeboys
but if the money long he can put the rubber on
rag city bitch rag city hoe
im a different breed and i do it for the jizz
masserati no rims do it for the scam
go hard or go home go hard or go home
go hard or go home go hard or go home
what your weed like what your bed like
what your heels like what your eyes like
what your bread like what your car like
what your crib like what your life like

i wanna take this time out from rapping right now
and share something really personal to the world
i wanna dedicate this to my baby

is a look ive never got from another brother
hes cool got swagg calm collective
and you know what else hes a damn good lover

the tenth sign of a zodiac one of the most serious and stable reliable responsible
and the characteristic that i like most is ladies he always ready willing and able
now when god created him i know he had to be in good mood
because my man gives me the utmost respect
and ladies hes never disrespectful and hes never rude
loving caring and giving hes all of the above

her pops tried to flex and bass then the tech correct
and spit in his face her brother dice tried to get shiest
so i took his life with a knife then asked him twice about his fucking son and wife
after that i load the gat and let the lead start flying
that shit is death defying now you need dental records to identify him
i had beef with this priest his name was father clyde
this how he died i had seven put on his side and fulled him with formaldehyde
i get more high then frequencies no one gets ass deep as me

and i quick to hurt a fool cause money got that murder pull
and dont leave my house without the guns mask and surgicals

and strap them down to clap them clowns i never seen a cap and gown
and im a basketcase ill bash your face and blast your waist
in a casket trace cause me and this bastard mase drop at a tragic place
cause uptown it aint nothing sweet its just guns a grief

run with introduers looters and sharpshooters
who spark buddah and fuck thick bitches with large hooters
beat niggas with lead pipes leave trails of dead mics
cause where im from niggas jewels get run like red lights

and we live by the street rules the thugs created
clowns get smoked about a thousand volts
so front and get a tech shoved down your throat

shawshank charmaleon six pack benatall

jihad jinkins liberating like abe lincoln

 twox

take it to the top
yea thats where we at with it hah
take it to the top
just cause you are a character uh
dont mean you have character
we taking stock right now
you ready lets go

a wise man know what he know and what he doesnt
if hes not really sure what hes saying he dont discuss it
a righteous man walks the earth without judgment
and loves his enemies enough to deliver justice
a pious man relies on religion for his direction
at times he introspective but his biblehood never questioned
a dying man will make a confession try to get into heaven
thinking his lifestyle is blocking his blessing
a violent man will stock up on weapons and go to war for his
get posttraumatic stress disorder become an officer
a man of peace uses his words in different mediums
hell bleed for his beliefs practicing civil disobedience
an honest man knows only liars are scared of the truth
his word is his bond but his actions always the proof
a faithful man never need evidence to believe
but still he gotta work for the blessings that he receives
lets go

sometimes its hard to believe
in what you dont see or understand
but the picture is so much bigger
than what we could even imagine
its hard to feel better
when the weight of the world make you feel sadder
put your faith into action
heads up and eyes open

top tier niggas blossomed in the basement
all the nights that we were lacking those refreshments
rain down thunderstorm with the flows
articulate with the bounce now im back like im derrick rose
once the one on the bench with the snotty nose
nefertiti would hold me when i was cold
communion sunday my twenties went in the bowl
forgive me lord for them bitches the night before
business deals and the bentleys i cant afford
gotta be the example for children to do their chores
blowing weed smoke on the cover of the source
rolling stones on the gone it was the boss
fallen soldier on his own so we march
roll up a bag of that weed therefore i spark
recite the quran im in the dark
devil knocking on my door he like a narc

sometimes its hard to believe
in what you dont see or understand
but the picture is so much bigger
than what we could even imagine
its hard to feel better
when the weight of the world make you feel sadder
put your faith into action
heads up and eyes open

no excuses if i start it then ill see it through
god is what i see in you so you might as well believe in you
think what you see on tvs true the media deceiving you
they misrepresenting misquoting then they misleading you
belief is a funny thing in case youre wondering
if they want the ring they coming for the throne like they the sons of kings
these average rappers is acting up for the dough
yeah i tell you what i believe but i back it up with what i know oh
its the facts versus the facts simile your raps killing me
my last victory was great moments in black history
i celebrated with a bottle i just brought back from italy
and some loud i got super packs like i backed hillary
lost in desire i walked through the devils fire
i inspire the resurrection of kings like hezekiah
the trust you put in me to be a beast with this rhyming
thats where the rubber meets the road and where your faith meets science
lets go

sometimes its hard to believe
in what you dont see or understand
but the picture is so much bigger
than what we could even imagine
its hard to feel better
when the weight of the world make you feel sadder
put your faith into action
heads up and eyes open

take it to the top take it to the top
yeah yeah take it to the top take it to the top
take it to the top take it to the top

kweli
whoa yeah yeah

how a nigga trying to regulate some shit thats not his
i aint trying to sign im just an artist nigga
im just trying to rhyme and go the hardest nigga

radio suckers never play me cause i dont let them
they like a pimp only hoes sweat them
when i do a show i love to catch the ladys eye
dodge the paparazzi i dont wanna see no lady die
sports entertainment academics business or politics
the fine hoes swallow dicks for dollars quick
young broads all up in gangs like the young lords
jump forward statutory rape now you done for
what you thought that shorty bout to act a her age
right now somebodys daughter is backstage
its a masterslave relationship and guess who toby
its the white girl in colorado and guess who kobe
tried to tell you not to fuck with these debutantes
thats more kobe beef than japanese restaurants
dont need diseases or cases trying to catch nothing
and when they throwing pussy best believe you catching something
say hi to tek

its not so much a business where you make a lot of money but if you enjoy the business then the money comes but if youre looking for the fast instant kind of famous and money its going to be boring to you because it doesnt happen quite like that

verse one
when the money come its sweet as a honeybun
but when the money gone they hide like a honeycomb
they tell you get your education
nigga go to college
they colonizing your mind like rhodesia
what you a rhodes scholar
they never tell you that degree is just a receipt
you be paying off them loans til youre six feet deep
peep
in my environment every snitch gon have to die
you ask me why
cuz my entitlement is american as apple pie
its hard to get a check its easy to get in debt
then get it wet
you could get a little head for a little bread
that shit is dead
get by get over
you gotta get ahead or be back in the shelter by twelve so you can get a bed
the conditions you raised in is preyin on your decisionmaking
you concentrating on that short paper
the broad paper that hard candy that jaw breaker
the dark side of the force pay for that lord vader
chorus
how you tell a nigga from the hood
we on the dirty sexy money like blair underwood
my money good xfour
cant touch it
its only human to want to look
money talk
my shit be tellin everyone to shhh
my money good xfour
verse two
the millionaire musician a fairly recent phenomenon
before there was  musicians performing on the street corners
out in the deep forest
the city drop the beat the night air sing a sweet chorus
the trees lean toward us in order to take in the cotwo that we let out and convert it into oxygen
every time you blow a breath out you start the cycle again
recycle the wind spin it any way you want it
its priceless this life is a blessing
no matter how you slice it or dice it you can grill it like a swordfish
a beautiful mind the bars gorgeous
i know im a suspect
when im walking and the streets is like my office
we the working class artists
they wishin that we was porpoise
but i know my worth
tell em to make an offer of gold first
im in the fight of my life and im taking the whole purse
soul search
for getting paid for creating the cold verse
got the money on my mind
tryna escape and it dont work
church
repeat chorus

you are now witnessing the demise of the music business
i say demise of the music business cause people always gonna need music in they life
you know what im saying
i cant do music with people im uncomfortable with
you know what im saying
i cant be on stage with you pouring out my soul if i dont like you
so with that said shout out to strong arm steady
shout out to jean grae
thats my blacksmith family you dig

i just heard a song that reminded me of times when you was finding me
rhyming in greenwich village circa one thousand nine hundred and ninetythree
yeah those was the salad days my careers appetizer
the main course a casserole a jambalaya
of different influences that led me where the music is
a student is only as good as his teachers tutelage
paying for college not learning was straight foolishness
so i stopped going to school but this was
hard to tell my parents  sat them down tried to get through to them
started flowing daily and traveled to different places
freestyled with clef and forte in the booga basement
with rubix and juju on flatbush my hood amazing
platinum island recording with duro and just blaze
and that was right next door to rawkus  whats up jarret and brian blackshaw
and matt fingaz kendra ross you got the soul of a stax singer
i love how you always bring it back sister
you and reesy making every record
i got classics with hitek and mos def that are so respected
shout out to corey smyth shout out to dave chapelle
i went on tour with the roots they played so well
writing rhymes with myka nine
me and pharoahe monch were soundbombing
me and lonnie lynn got a lot in common
mystik journeymen introduced me to top ramen
on the bus kanye west would never stop rhyming
aint no mountain high enough for him he never stopped climbing
thats why when the homies win i never stop smiling
see im smiling right now

nothing else matters more than friends and family
no doubt thats how its gotta be
this is my odyssey its just the god in me
friends and family
yup they all a part of me
cause i would die for them and they would die for me
friends and family
thats right and plus i love my fans
love when you throw your hands up  its like you all my fam
friends and family
like you considered kin
got me through thick and thin thank you for listening
nothing else matters more than friends and family

it started with a blast now im a iconoclast
promise to be honest in my craft and make the promise last
i do this for myself but the song for you
once i put it out for sale then it belong to you
this for amani fela plus diyani eshe
your daddy love his girl your mother never far away
this is for eque this for kierra paul
we wanna ride like ciara and we will never fall
headcquarterz and guru is love forever yall

your legacy will always be remembered for forever or
til the end of time whichever come first
big love to my mom and dad  you could have done worse
jamal and i the way we are cause you put your sons first
many black parents lose they sons to the gun burst
mommas drowning in they own tears til they lungs burst
voice cracking like michael stipe cause everyone hurts

first record was with mood back in ninetysix
in fact it was pretty fresh  google that find that shit
it sound good i was showing you what timeless is
you couldnt catch what i was saying without rewinding it
believe me every fan is special
you hear me now but i got fans from lyricist lounge and manifesto
so much wack rap i know its hard to tell the difference
but when i heat it up i make the garbage smell
im resurrected but im no savior
i know the game i can ball a little bit  im an ok player
double meaning cause the flow is layered
we love to say it but its easier than it sound to ignore the haters
to snap back like the jaws of gators

twox
where do we go what do we say what do we do
nowhere to turn nowhere to run and theres nothin new
where do we go for inspiration
its like pain is our only inspiration

yea i see a place where little boys and girls
are shells in the oceans not knowin they a pearl
no one to hold em while they growin
they livin moment to moment without a care in the whole world
now if i could help it i tell it just like it is
and i may say some things that you dont like to hear
i know this that people lie people kneel
people die people heal people steal and people shed tears
whats real blood spills gun kill the sun stillrise
above me trust me it must be morningtime
wake up the stakes up
everybody want the cake up to break up with the crew
but when the karma come back for what you do
its too late to make upsome excuse

i come from people who stronger than time and space
wherever theres competition you gonna find the race
i find a place in my heart for this hiphop
and pump blood through my vein my skin get hot
i take you very serious and make you write more
if i dont celebrate i got nothing to fight for
im tight raw excite yall like nightfall
im tight yall i walk the street like yall
about action talk is cheap right yall
you start yappin think about the beef you might cause
the trouble you could get into
you dont study you not prepared and cats is testin you
what you gonna do when you gotta face
the manifestation of the words that you put in space
they already there you cant take em out
the studio gangsta inside you tryin to break out

yea i see a place where little boys and girls
are shells in the oceans not knowin they a pearl
no one to hold em while they growin
they livin moment to moment without a care in the whole world
now if i could help it i tell it just like it is
and i may say some things that you dont like to hear
i know this that people lie people kneel
people die people heal people steal and people shed tears
whats real blood spills gun kill the sun stillrise
above me trust me it must be morningtime

a car or a phone forget about gettin a loan
you starting to moan your bank account is getting withdrawn
its pitiful how we becomin slaves to things that we own
they enslavin the brains with the whips and the chains
end up in the coffin chasing the fortune chasing the fame
slave to the rhythm slave to the night slave to the day
they hop aboard the underground railroad and run away
pray for the day niggas dont get taken away
for makin a way to stop their babys stomach aching today
i sip a whiskey straight no chase
its hard to take a man away from the sin when its inside of him
please

the prostitutes sellin the shit right in front of the cops
under the street lamp walking through the rain until our feet damp
single moms all line at the office because they need stamps
your cousin out of jail he spent his time finding god
with a felony kinda charge its kinda hard to find a job

as hes gotta get that gainful employment for his probation

just because you got out of jail that dont mean you free
  sizzla

the vital signs are improving i make em lay down
an idle mind is usually described as the devils playground
my rep established im rapping just for the sport of it
been nice for a career you just barely grasping the thought of it
indebted to the hood like a rush card
supported like push up bras and lumbar
except im never sitting im ever living like mumm
ra im the sun god
smart as a whip but forever ripping it dumb hard
i see you fronting with them dollar store shades on
faker than abs thats sprayed artificial as rayon
my rhyming satisfying your quest for fire like rae dawn

mixed with a bit of krsone and qtip

who woulda thunk that would ever happen
rootin for kweli cause he brung back clever rappin
sister  heads wrapped in fabric of the standard music
chicks  with their tits made of plastic look dancin to it
in this arena i balance your boy stand alone
and win it cause these rappers is more annoying than camera phones
maybe its me it could be hard to move me
but these niggas got me trippin like a white girl in a horror movie

yo the trap got you blastin your heat
its hot ones like shotguns from the passenger seat
the mic booth the district where they be packin the meat
cause they kept it raw as the jump off i hop back on the beat
back on the street like an excon
with enough in his pocket for a tip at a restaurant

cuttin through the bullshit record labels and the shady deals
ladies feel the beat when they out clubbin like baby seals
let me chill out cause the raw image to focus on
get back to my point this joint is jumpin like a circus song
yeah to break it down to the basic components
they dont want it so im runnin out of worthy opponents whoa

poems written by shakur as  interpreted by other artists

please wake me when i am free
i cannot bear captivity
where my country i am told hold no significance
i waited and died in ignorance
but my inner eye can see a race
who reigned as king in another place
the green trees were rich and full
and every man spoke of beautiful men and women together as equals
war was gone because all was at peace
but now like a nightmare i woke to see
that i live like a prisoner of poverty
please wake me when i am free
i cannot bear captivity
for i would rather be stricken blind
than to live without expression of mind
babatunde olatunki begins to speak in another language

because we all spring from different trees
does not mean we are not created equally

i was that tree that grew from the weeds and wasnt meant to be
ashamed im not in fact i am proud of my thriving  family  tree

because we all spring from different trees
does not mean we are not created equally

ashamed im not in fact i am proud of my thriving  family  tree

when i tell you im livin large you tell me its trouble
congratulations on the weddin i hope your wife know

we used to be like distant cousins fightin playin dozens
whole neighborhood buzzin knowin that we wasnt
used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
im gettin blitzed and i reminisce on all the times we shared
besides bumpin and grindin wasnt nothin on our mind
in time wed learned to live a life of crime
rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
i caught a felony lovin the way the guns blow
and even though we separated you said that youd wait
dont give nobody no coochie while ill be locked up state
i kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
said ill return but i gotta fight the fates arrived
dont shed a tear cause mama i aint happy here

that i keep a glock beside my head when will it stop

as we dream in a paranoid state
and our fate is a lifetime of hate

happiness living on the streets is a delusion
even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
shot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought
nine millimeter kickin thinkin about what the streets do to me
cause they never taught peace in the black community
all we know is violence do the job in silence
walk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
too many brothers daily headed for the big pen
niggas comin out worseoff than when they went in
over the years ive done a lot of growin up
gettin drunk throwin up cuffed up then i said i had enough
there must be another route way out to money and fame
i changed my name played a different game
tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
if one more cop harrasses me i just might go psycho
and when i get em ill hit em with the bum rush
only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
yo if youre smart youll really let me go g
but keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the uzi

they got me trapped can barely walk the city streets
without a cop harasskin me searching me then askin my identity
hands up throw me up against the wall didnt do a thing at all
im telling you one day these suckers gotta fall
cuffed up throw me on the concrete
coppers try to kill me but they didnt know this was the wrong street
bang bang count another casualty
but its a cop whos shot for his brutality
who do you blame its a shame because the mans slain
he got caught in the chains of his own game
how can i feel guilty after all the things they did to me
sweated me hunted me trapped in my own community
one day im gonna bust blow up on this society
why did you lie to me i couldnt find a trace of equality
worked me like a slave while they laid back
homie dont play that its time i let em suffer the payback
im tryin to avoid physical contact
i cant hold back its time to attack jack
they got me trapped

uh uh they cant keep the black man down
you know they got me trapped
naw they cant keep the black man down

uh uh they cant keep the black man down
they got me trapped

cant use the phone cause im sure someone is tapping in
did it before aint scared to use my gat again
i look back in hindsight the fight was irrelevant
but now hes the devils friend too late to be tellin him
he shot first and ill be damned if i run away
homie is done away i shouldve put my gun away
i wasnt thinkin all i heard was the ridicule
girlies was laughin tup sayin damn homies is dissin you
i fired my weapon started steppin in the hurricane
i got shot so i dropped feelin a burst of pain
got to my feet couldnt see nothin but bloody blood
now im a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
ran through an alley still lookin for my getaway
copper say freeze or youll be dead today
trapped in a corner dark and i couldnt see the light
thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life
what do i do live my life in a prison cell
id rather die than be trapped in a living hell
they got me trapped

uh uh they cant keep the black man down
they got me trapped
naw they cant keep the black man down
trapped
uh uh they cant keep the black man down
you know they got me trapped
naw they cant keep the black man down
trapped

yo yall seen twopac man yall seen twopac man
there he go ay pac

resist the temptation
this song go out to the underground railroad
digital underground

resist the temptation of the beast
you slip and loose your grip and forever fall asleep
the venom is contagious be wary of its spell
what you thought would be heaven turns out to be hell
i wonder if she knows the devils taking off her clothes
deep into her soul slow now hes in control
poppas doing worse a victim of his deadly curse
wouldnt be the first to leave the ghetto in a hearse
oh and how it hurts the children pay the biggest price
never get the chance to grow up with a happy life
blame it on the rock but we know thats a bunch of crap
someone from the top supplying us with plenty crack
keep em in a daze dont let them see the other way
let em all get paid wont live to see another day
see they never got a breath of the sunshine
now the kids addicted and only hit it one time
were destined to be dead as a nation
dont let it come to this resist the temptation

from pyramid top to bottom of bowl
from whips and locks to fist and afro
we dug too deep to give up this gold
dont be bought and you wont be sold
running on empty you aint gon go
running on empty lead you to nowhere
we fact nobody can lie
so resist the temptation

gamble for your soul with the devil
you wonder how low can you go before you finally reach the lowest level
as everybody sit and stares
theres no use looking in your eyes cause there isnt anybody there
and though it may make you wanna cry
got you stealing from your family and you dont even know why
i guess you think theyll understand
you feel cold cause you sold your soul to the dopeman
oh now theres no turning back in fact
its decided that would live and die for the crack
you got no friends cause you cheated em all
feel lonely low defeated and small
no one was there when i took the wrong path
and nobodyd care if i died in a blood bath
but is this my destiny
tell the lord they got my mind but he can have the rest of me
cause im ready to end it all
one bullet to the brain forgive my sins and all
i didnt mean to be a bother
a failure as a son a husband and a father
i wish i could turn back the time
go back and find why i let it crack my mind
and my only explanation it came to this
resist the temptation

from pyramid top to bottom of bowl
from whips and locks to fist and afro
we dug too deep to give up this gold
dont be bought and you wont be sold
running on empty you aint gon go
running on empty lead you to nowhere
we fact nobody can lie
so resist the temptation

your death left family behind
your wife and your son find a gun and pieces of daddys mind
on the door and on the floor
now her husband is dead what else is she living for
so now she picks up the gun
now son is the only one
grows up in adoption homes
gets older bolder and cold cause hes left alone
to him nothing is funny
mind set on one thing making his money
since i was left with no hope
i want money and gold ropes and so i slang dope
now im the neighborhood dopeman
and as long cause they smoking ill never be broke man
i live the life of a trifle
following a cycle so im just a psycho
but if i had a better life
i would have lived a good life and did more things right
hard to resist temptation
with all the aggravation and the frustration
of living in the ghetto
your mind gets twisted just like a pretzel
so its time that i check out
but one nosy cop just wont let me get out
they got me trapped once again
with a choice shoot the cop or live life in the pen
i cant stand the frustration
resist the temptation

from pyramid top to bottom of bowl
from whips and locks to fist and afro
we dug too deep to give up this gold
dont be bought and you wont be sold
running on empty you aint gon go
running on empty lead you to nowhere
we fact nobody can lie
so resist the temptation

good heart bad breed
living in the ill manor but were no plan b
mummy got christ daddy got a vice not surprised
he aint tryna follow no pipe dreams
nature or nurture is destiny real
if this estate had lakes and green fields
and he went eton and oxford too
would monkey see monkey do like you
fine line between obstacles and excuses
but a thick skin will still bump and bruise
and when you need them blue kickers and new creps
special brew wont get you dressed for school

you wont find seashells in east end
but you might see shells in east end
there aint no pier or no rock here
but most of your peers will sell rocks here
survival instincts a must
you hug that road but road dont show love
leave that place before you get stuck
cant wait till your wake before you wake up

this place aint changed
theres still a war going on inside of a defeaters mind
this place aint changed
a mans home is his castle but freedom lives outside
winners and losers
yep the manors a nogo tshirt weather but mandem are so cold
is it better
out here to out here

we came up in the same ends
bought sweets with the same pence
pot luck or was i godblessed
if i couldnt rap would i be in the same mess
postcode blame the postcode
but a strong minds like a vacation
the power of escapism
if you aint dreaming then you aint living
fork in the road which wayd you wanna go
trust me bruv i know the ropes gotta make a plan though
but youre in too deep gotta keep your fam afloat
and just cause we dont speak dont mean i wanna see you go
and you can blame me but thats eating up a hole
now your sisters on the phone me and smithy had to go
to your hospital bed with the tumour up in your nose
it was really touch and go while i was there
where was the ends then

you wont find seashells in east end
but you might see shells in east end
there aint no pier or no rock here
but most of your peers will sell rocks here
survival instincts a must
you hug that road but road dont show love
leave that place before you get stuck
cant wait till your wake before you wake up

this place aint changed
theres still a war going on inside of a defeaters mind
this place aint changed
a mans home is his castle but freedom lives outside
winners and losers
yep the manors a nogo tshirt weather but mandem are so cold
is it better
out here to out here

the manor
invisible walls that never fall
learn to climb before you crawl
dont get stuck here
manmade or mindmade
dont be a statistic blaming ghetto physics for holding you back
eternal strength versus external influences
victim or victor
the manor
concreted souls
cheap  industry folk
we share the same roads but not the same code
low selfesteemers mercs and beemers
small winners
itiswhatitisers
but you deserve more
the manor
throwing bricks at glass ceilings
do or die
he who dreams with open eyes is alive

this place aint changed
theres still a war going on inside of a defeaters mind
this place aint changed
a mans home is his castle but freedom lives outside

seen the look of love on many mad faces
when i rhymed about the time and not the paper chases
people all over the world givin mad respect
when i identified who the government wrecked
whats the sound scan ask the company rep
they dont care they just about keepin their checks

round and around and around we go
where the worlds headed nobody knows
round and around and around we go
where the worlds headed nobody knows
round and around and around we go

hear the crime rhyme created a lotta robots
can the real lyric fix the shit that the time forgot
loops gotcha brain gettin locked loaded up with words
that never meant a lot and you cant call the cops
and yall dont really know and yall dont hear me through
takes a nation of big brains to break up that flow
and the game aint changed but the heads be rearranged
in danger my language is rappin in anger
i be bangin so i point my finger
while we sleep racists set us up like sheep
every time i go someplace slaves in my face
black people in a plantation state
no control of our soul and wouldnt know our fate
now am i wrong to hate hate
thirtyeight countries fiftyone states now you tell me
who in the world gonna compensate
one hundred million lost make a nigga wait
gotta beg the queen to get food on the plate

round and around and around we go
where the worlds headed nobody knows
round and around and around we go
where the worlds headed nobody knows
round and around and around we go
where the worlds headed nobody knows
round and around and around we go
where the worlds headed nobody knows

im taking all types of medication
to keep me out the mood of premeditating
yo the longer im alone its worse
im having thoughts of killing me but im killing you first
my psychiatrist talks but i dont listen

i sit alone in my four cornered room starin at candles
are we on the radio dukes
awww yeah give it to me

it aint changed but its a different time
and im still playin tricks with my mind
my mothers always stressin that im livin wrong
but i got my smith and wesson cause im gettin grown
and their lookin at your little boys success
and i been thinkin im dealin with too much stress
so i stay up on my ps and qs
and watch out for the gs and fools
cause the homies that i thought i had
see me stackin up a grip
and they just started talkin bad
so i stay away from outsiders
and when i roll through it makes em open they mouth wider
i used to think that you was my one and only homie
my mind was playin tricks on me

my mind was playin tricks on me
my mind was playin tricks on me

yeah
dear diary im havin a little problem with my mind state
how many bullets would it take to change my mind wait
sometimes i want to end it but i dont though
they tell me see my pastor but i dont go
cause they all be on this one street
so i take it on myself to thank him one deep
and give my money to the most needy
and never put it in the hands of the most greedy
cause their puttin a price tag on a mans word
and its a fashion show so the men flirt
the world is endin so they try to make us switch fast
and they openin up these churches for some quick cash
and usin the money fo they new cribs
while brother johnson just got kicked out where he lived
i follow no man cause man be phoney
my mind was playin tricks on me
my mind was playin tricks on me

day by day its more impossible to cope
i feel like im the one thats doin dope
cant seem to keep my mind on a steady track
im all about gettin mine so i study that
but it seems they want to get me
so i try to keep my nine millimeter wit me
just in case they want to see a homies head blown
but i got to stay around to see my kids grown
i finally found a woman who could deal wit me
back then i had a woman who wasnt real wit me
and now shes back with her old lady
and now i got it goin on and they sure hate me
now im a goner and shes a loner
hahahaha her mind was playin tricks on her
one time for your motherfuckin mind
bringin it back like this here

my mind was playin tricks on me

rappers screaming all in our ears like were deaf
tempt me do a number on the label
eat up all they emcees and drink em under the table
like its on meput it on my tab kid
however you get there foot it cab it iron horse it
youre leaving on your face forfeit
i crush the mic hold it like the heat he might toss it
told him tell her they stole it he told her he lost it
she told him get off it and a bunch of other more shit
getting money dts be getting no new leads
its like he eating watermelon stay spitting new seeds
its the weed give me some of what he drooping off
soon as he wake up choking like it was whooping cough
they group been soft
first hour at the open bar and theyre trooping off
he went to go laugh and get some head by the side road
she asked him autograph her derriere read
to wide load this yard bird taste like fried toad turd
love villain take pride in code words
crooked eye mold nerd geek with a cold heart
probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart
study how to eat to die by the pizza guy
no hes not too fly to skeet in a skeezer eye
and squeeze her thigh maybe give her curves a feel
the same way she feel it when he flow with nerves of steel
they call the super when they need their back uhh plumbing fixed
how there only one left the pack comes in six
whatever happened to two and three
a herb tried to slide with four and five and got caught like what you doing g
dont make me have to get cutting like truancy
matter fact not for nothing right now you and me
looser than a pair of adidas
i hope you brought your spare tweeters mcs sound like cheerleaders
rapping and dancing like red head kingpin
doom came do his thing again no matter who be blingin
he do it for the smelly hubbies
seeds know what time it is like its time for tellie tubbies
few can do it even fewer can sell it
take it from the dude who wears mask like a tarded helmet
he plots shows like robberies
in and out one two three no bodies please
run the cash and you wont get a wet sweatshirt
the mic is the shotty nobody move nobody get hurt
bring heat like your boy done gone to war
he came in the door and everybody on the floor
a whole string of jobs like we on tour
every night on the score coming to your corner store

there it is done
now that the representative from south africa has been mind programmed
all of the world leaders on earth are under my control
and when they meet tomorrow in special session
i doom shall be voted master of the world
my plan is foolproof but just in case
and what about snow

niggasll never run out of shit
so much shit so much scripts through here niggas never run out of shit
 its another roller coaster ride

walk the path of jesus witness if hell freezes
the mind teases reality crack the pieces
nothing eases being chastise with blood baptize
guys revise acknowledge past lives
statements will be made acknowledge me
my mind is heavens gate so enter me
my mind is the gate to hell so try to flee
both gates look the same which will it be
demons scream from thought process
enter semen child born stress
body want to sleep but the mind cant rest
measure pleasure through financial progress
when it come to currency love is nonexistent
foes multiply friends become so distant
some hope you die backstab in an instant
foes i despise disguised as allies
to sabotage camouflage
loyalty is lies
to see god look into my eyes
to see the devil then you look into my eyes
as i rise from hells equator

cause imma slow it up speed it up slow it up speed it up
metal fingers feed beats grimm reaper eat em up
speed em up slow em up speed em up slow it up
brainsick tick tick tick mf blow it up
slow it up speed it up slow it up speed it up
metal fingers feed beats grimm reaper eat it up
speed it up slow it up speed it up slow it up
brainsick tick tick tick mf blow it up

take air compress it bless it
mix loops like ku klux
mf dont give two fucks
nigga quarterback blitz popped quickly fumble
leave game with concussion seeing stars and mumbles
this happens to any emcee that wants to rumble
dynasties destroyed like carringtons and colbys
noise reduced mf thinks in dolby
chop that ass in half like obiwan kenobi
greatest of all time god straight up told me
greatest of all time the devil even told me
icicles on surfaces of sun we livin coldly
prophets be phony
and we attack we switch like the wu tang symbol
still kill jack even though quick and nimble plain and simple
pick niggas off while they ballin
and die old like stalin
yes death i hear you callin i accept collect
human sacrifice must pay respect
we catch reck nigga we catch reck
and we gonna gonna

boom
mf grimm mf doom

so i met this young lady ya know when i went back home i was tryna spit my best game to her you know give her my best cap but she kept on snapping her fingers like snaps i said you know what girl you crazy then she asked me what he said

what did the asian say a peace of mind
thats what the asian saidi need a divine
intervention was his religion and i was surprised
him believing in buddha me believing in god
asked him what are you doing he said taking my time
meditation is a must it dont hurt if you try
see you thinking too much plus you too full of yourself
worried about your career you ever think of your health

what did the indian say a piece of land
thats what the indian saidi needed the man
telling me longevity is in the dirt
should buy some property first
should profit a better dollar with generational perks
equity at his best really you should invest
these tangible things expire dont you expect
income with so much outcome and yes
look at my heritage we blessed
now what the black man say a piece of pussy
thats what the black man said i needed to push me
to the limit to satisfy my hunger
we do it all for a woman from haircut to a war
we like to live in the jungle like to play in the peach
what you saying to me
he said nigga come back to reality for a week
pussy is power fuck on a new bitch every night
i wouldnt be prouder you should allow it

what the white man say a piece of mines
thats what the white man wanted when i rhyme
telling me that he selling me just for one thousand and ninetynine
if i go platinum from rapping i do the company fine
what if i compromise he said it dont even matter
you make a million or more you living better than average
you losing your core following gaining it all
he put a price on my talent i hit the bank and withdraw
hit the bank and withdraw hit the bank and withdraw
put myself in the rocket ship and i shot for the stars
look at what you accomplished and what he said to the boy
ima make you some promises that you just cant ignore
your profession anonymous as an artist if i dont target your market
if you aint signing your signature when i throw you my wallet
a lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
your world tour your masters mortgage i need a piece

i holler what you do what you say
i shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if i get freed today
i holler what you do what you say
i shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if i get freed today

what the black man say
tell em we dont die tell em we dont die
tell em we dont die we multiply
tell em we dont die tell em we dont die
tell em we dont die we multiply
tell em we dont die tell em we dont die
tell em we dont die we multiply
tell em we dont die tell em we dont die
tell em we dont die we multiply

what money got to do with it
when i dont know the full definition of a rap image
im trapped inside the ghetto and i aint proud to admit it
institutionalized i keep runnin back for a visit
hol up get it back
i said im trapped inside the ghetto and i aint proud to admit it
institutionalized i could still kill me a nigga so what

if i was the president

life to me like a box of chocolate
quid pro quo somethin for somethin thats the obvious
oh shit flows so sick dont you swallow it
bitin my style youre salmonella poison positive
i can just alleviate the rap industry politics
milk the game up never lactose intolerant
the last remainder of real shit you know the obvious
me scholarship no streets put me through colleges
be all you can be true but the problem is
dream only a dream if work dont follow it
remind me of the homies that used to know me now follow this
ill tell you my hypothesis im probably just way too loyal
k dizzle will do it for you my niggas think im a god
truthfully all of em spoiled usually youre never charged
but somethin came over you once i took you to them fuckin bet awards
you lookin at artistses like theyre harvestses
so many rollies around you and you want all of them
somebody told me you thinkin bout snatchin jewelry
i shouldve listened when my grandmama said to me

shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass nigga
shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass boy
shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass nigga
oh now slow down

and once upon a time in a city so divine
called west side compton there stood a little nigga
he was five foot something god bless the kid
took his homie to the show and this is what they said

fuck am i posed to do when im lookin at walkin licks
the constant big money talk bout the mansion and foreign whips
the private jets and passport presidential glass floor
gold bottles gold models givin up the ass for
instagram flicks suckin dick fuck is this
one more sucker wavin with a flashy wrist
my defense mechanism tell me to get him
quickly because he got it
its a recession then why the fuck he at king of diamonds
no more livin poor meet my fourfour
when i see em put the per diem on the floor
now kendrick know theyre your coworkers
but its gon take a lot fore this pistol go cold turkey
now i can watch his watch on the tv and be okay
but see im on the clock once that watch landin in la
remember steal from the rich and givin it back to the poor
well thats me at these awards
i guess my grandmama was warnin a boy
she said

shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass nigga
shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass boy
shit dont change until you get up and wash yo ass nigga
oh now slow down

and once upon a time in a city so divine
called west side compton there stood a little nigga
he was five foot something dazed and confused
talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
you can take your boy out the hood
but you cant take the hood out the homie
took his show money stashed it in the mozey wozey
hollywoods nervous
fuck you goodnight thank you much for your service

get your lazy butt up off my couch
get your lazy butt up off
get your lazy butt up off
get your lazy butt up off my couch

it seems nowadays friends step to me bogus
and end up on my couch at night without notice
its cool to have a friend over every now and then but i gotta have my space
and i dont wanna see their face
like every single day of the week talk is cheap
you betta find yourself another place to sleep
it aint my fault that ya moms got fed up
and now you wanna come to my crib and wet my bed up
you better find a job so you can get an apartment
and you can save your crocodile tears dont even start with
the sob stories i got enough from the other seven brothas in the den playin genesis
damn i cant win at this
seems like im gonna have to flip
and tell those other brothas that theyre gonna have to skip
ive had it up to here with these lazy cats
they keep sleepin on my couch and im tired of that

people come to my house and kinda wonder where the squadrons at
theyre not gone theyre just down at the laundrymat
because they wear the same pairs of clothing
im taking up crazy patience just holding
my temper
im about to start charging rent for
every single brother that kicked it with my mother eating biscuits on saturday morning like a family
the minute they step its like moms is crazy mad at me
cause theyre in my mothers room watching television
i feel like giving em the boot and say the hell with em
but if i give em the boot im not a friend though
even though my room smells like dime bags of indo
but i cant pretend like i havent been peepin it
even mom knows that my brothas been sleepin on
my couch for weeks so your speeches fall flat
they keep sleepin on my couch and im tired of that

maybe this was just my upbringing perhaps
but i was taught that i shouldnt take seven day naps
at other brothas cribs like i dont have a home
brothas on my couch so much theres like foam
coming out the seams and a pair of jeans
is missing from my closet i wonder why i even bother being friendly
theyre running my ass like the indy five thousand
they went and wrinkled my mothers blouse
when they snuck downstairs for a midnight snack
and ate the last slice of bread and a box of apple jacks
then they hit the sack with the stereo blastin
and even little tyson is fed up so im askin
you all to jet before i get upset
and throw each and every one of you bums out on your back
my house is a mess so step ya little pest
who was sleepin on my couch cause im tired of that

i light the firecracker wiretapper
tryna crack the pieces of information he should asked us
game chopper insane logic brain brolic
trained pilot i aim at plain targets
keep rollin stay glowing
so cold it would behoove fools to chill or be frozen
no wins for those kids
gon get burnt out burning the fuse at both ends
trendstarter get larger
its do or die see what i do to fools who pretend they martyrs
who are you dont argue
like you so familiar with the anatomy you claim no part two
forecastin more fashion sportcastin
playin em for a spell no more racket
so hot robots gon pop
deactivate their program thats a remote stop
skill is neededare you interested keep the frequency clear

what theyll never see and who theyll never be
you are so far beyond
what theyll never see and who theyll never be
you are so far beyond

got shit designed for the ear
just to make you recline like a chair
man of the board over affairs
you see it come and go like it was invited there
keep it to yourself though that aint for tell
or youre undone and your prophecy fail
come to the conclusion it probably failed
when foes brew a plot like ale
for the dough theyll go against the grain
no matter how you slice it thats a crummy way to play
they got it coming to em like age
when they turn up and they on another page
they phased out last year they got played out
frequency too weak transition they way out
going nowhere their transmission gave out
gassed up but cant accelerate now
who cares its time to celebrate now
by breaking down how they fear of a breakdown
trying to be swift pump your brakes now
word travels fast soon as it break out
foes we take out once we give the order to go
we drive through and then they get what they paid for
unstable situationwhos supporting them though
i dont know

what theyll never see and who theyll never be
you are so far beyond
what theyll never see and who theyll never be
you are so far beyond

damn i had them sad eyes when my dad died
why are the pure guys always the bad guys
i aint from here i just passed by
why you always cattin on your last life
little do they know i aint little no more
i aint saying im the biggest im just bigger than most
you flashy with your bread cinnamon toast
all these rappers are actors in cinema shows
oakland showed me how the third eye open
slow motion sipping magic potion
lonesome home alone macaulay culkin
broken i think apocalypse approaching
in the danger room but my name aint logan
hot enough to light a fire in the ocean so hot
watch the walls all close in
its game over for you now insert one more token

what theyll never see and who theyll never be
you are so far beyond
what theyll never see and who theyll never be
you are so far beyond

hey sucker nigga whoever you are
hey sucker nigga whoever you are
hey sucker nigga hey sucker nigga
whoever you are whoever you are

i be hating sucker mcs and the sucker niggas
posing like they hard when we know they damn card
what you figure rhymewise i do the figure eight so concisely
musically we are the herb so sit back and light me
inhale
my style is kinda fat reminiscent of a whale
young girls desires older female dreams
i be the abstract poetic representing from queens
socially im not inane black and white got game
if you came to the jam well im glad you came
see nigga first was used back in the deep south
falling out between the dome of the white mans mouth
it means that we will never grow you know the word dummy
upper niggas in the community think its crummy

qtip
in the morning woke up from sexual pleasures
looked at her sexual partner
who acquainted her acquaintance
five hours ago at a disco
she went lower than low into limbo
a thought crossed her mind her a bimbo
she answered no so she had to go
on with the program
creedence it seems that ive forgotten your name
but it seems that shes done the same
and now something has happened
suddenly shes been distracted
by something that has been attracted
she poked and poked and smacked at it
then she broke down and she scratched it
now i think you understand
clinic saw the doctor flex his biceps
then he picked up a pair of forceps
her pretty face showed fright
right then and there she fainted
a really grim picture is painted
the brother who she acquainted
was the enemy scary aint it
the pubic enemy
qtip
old king cole was a merry old soul
had a lady queen married since eighteen
he protested that he was infested
with lots of love and he couldnt digest it
all propaganda one big fat lie
cause i seen the king with my very own eye
schemed the scheme like a crack fiend fiend
and poppin up on the teenage scene
and proppin and pimpin hunnies with moneys
whole situation to tip was kinda funny
he hold the crown but not the jimmy hat
now he wears a frown and the jimmy hates that
so the fair maiden in the royal bedroom
caught the king scratchin so she had to assume
that he got vicked by the enemys tricks
the thought of cheatin made the maiden so sick
that she screamed and screamed went on and kept screamin
threw a pot and his dome was beamin
you could hear him yellin in the motherland
baby baby please baby understand
she ignored and walked through the gate
the king is in the kingdom to await his fate
of the enemy the pubic enemy
qtip
everybody get sweaten a deep is still a threaten
about the aids that hate the aids but still will be forgettin
about the  like the rocky picture horror
dont move tracks cause the pubic had the hour
you can get it from sleepin in nasty dirty sheets and
wearin nasty clothes for oh about a weekend
i suggest you do yourself a big favor
the press i keep questin ill be damned if i save ya
please remember this a kiss is just a kiss
a hug is just a hug but a bug aint just a bug
if you get the bug oh boy youll be buggin
youll regrets your moments even when you started lovin
 damn after loving just take it out
dont get so far to q man
inspect yourself protect yourself
respect yourself then correct yourself
make sure you dont get hand by the man
yo ill leave man damn

for the days of grimness and oppression

devoted to the arts of movin butts so get on up and
think about whats yours

yeah used to be at silvercity indigo
used to be in lunchroom playin dominoes
i dont want to have to go to funerals
i gotta start sleepin at the studio
i dont have no time to be no romeo
all the love i need is at the rodeo
all the love i need is here at ovo yeah
all the girls i know are there with e and tho
who knows where i end up when that shit gets old
maybe it never gets old and thats just how it goes
last table left in carbone callin plays on the rotary phone
i take a glass of domina to go with me home
might move our annual shit to the dome
i need forty thousand people to see what im on
yeah ducked a lot of spiteful moves
i was an angry yout when i was writin views
saw a side of myself that i just never knew
ill probably selfdestruct if i ever lose but i never do
steady doin double shifts
oneda doin the beat and i open up like a double click
more blessings because im generous
thirtyseater plane for like ten of us
remember when i bought sealey the fake chanel wallet
she knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
nowadays when we catchin up we just laugh about it
cant describe what my life is like when she asks about it
scary whenever i close my eyes at night
wakin up to public statements about my private life
i can never sleep til mornin on all my quiet nights
but you can rest assure that my mind is right
get no sick days i leave for like three months in six days
never stick around to see shit change
get lil updates texts in my inboxes have been poppin
seasons go by like im bingewatchin
went from club palazzo in the bridge to club liv
to not even showin up at a club less we doin bis
i cant even party while a nigga pursuin this
distractions will do you in in the truest sense
especially people that want to lecture me
and frame it like they just want the best for me
or they check for me whatever splits it up
so theres more for them and theres less for me
they dont know they got to be faster than me to get to me
no ones done it successfully
sevenam in germany cant believe that they heard of me
last verse that i gotta do is always like surgery
always tryin to let go of anything thatll burden me
thats the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
last chance i get to make sure that you take it personally
take this shit to heart its always executed perfectly
if we do a song its like takin my kids to work with me
you overnight celebrity you one day star
swear i told you that im in this bitch for eternity
i am a reflection of all of your insecurities
behind closed doors a lot of six god worshipping
done talk now cause theres other shit thats concernin me
theres real ones around me
i want to make sure they learn from me
i want to see my dog but his grandmothers his surety
he cant even dip out to see me in an emergency
my life is centered round competition and currency
takin summer off cause they tell me i need recovery
maybe gettin back to my regular life will humble me

this year for christmas i just want apologies
sydney gave up on me when i went missin
syn had a baby and treated me different
erika sued me and opened a business
wonder if they wish it couldve been different

i hate the number two that shit is unforgiven
tryna satisfy everybody
its like they cant get enough
until enough is enough
and then its too much
you tip the scale when i weigh my options
west palm girls are spoiled rotten
tiffany on you you know you poppin

master bedrooms where we get it poppin
just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
im a walkin comeup im a bank deposit
sell my secrets and get top dollar

opportunity and temptation
they would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
sell my secrets back to me if i was payin

i am still here with who i started with
the game needed life i put my heart in it
i blew myself up im on some martyr shit
carry the weight for my city like a cargo ship
im twentythree with a money tree
growing more too i just planted a hundred seeds
its ironic cause my mother was a florist
and thats how she met my pops
and now my garden is enormous
its happening penny lane just like you said
i avoided the coke game and went with sprite instead
uhhuh thats word to the millions that they putting up
im trying to do better than good enough

what am i afraid of
this is supposed to be what dreams are made of
but people i dont have the time to hang with
always look at me and say the same shit
they say you promised me you would never change
you promised me you would never change

am i wrong for making light of my situation clap on
when forty got some shit for me to snap on now that im on
i dont really want to worry about getting back on

and i be acting like i dont know how to work a phone
but hit redial youll see that i just called
some chick i met at the mall that i barely know at all and

what am i afraid of
this is supposed to be what dreams are made of
but people i dont have the time to hang with

you promised me you would never change

i live by some advice this girl lissa told me
the other day lissa told me that she missed the old me
which made me question when i went missing
and when i started treating my friends different
maybe it was the fast paced switch up
or the two guns in my face during the stick up
maybe cause a girl i thought i trusted
was who set the whole shit up
but in fact i havent seen them since they locked big rich up
i know but same time im quick to forget
im bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
burn it all burn it all im starting it fresh
cause half the time i got it right i probably guessed

for me and you
samples into outro

the first step is a doozy its roulette with a mood ring
the birth of an old slang the death of a new speak
a permanent postgame is littered with bridge trolls
skirting the copay divvy the death toll
innumerable codenames alerted and mobile
familiar rising and furnacing cold piles
resilient style kings impossibly tantrum
wandering wild things obelisk phantoms
on linoleum or lava leaders of a leadfoot fauna
his left source blunt force trauma
not pillar of the commune a splinter off the pagan
who vote off the elusiveness of truth and exultation
from the point of view of students labeled putrid little aphids
by the beautiful and cryogenic stasis
sadists meanwhile makers of a hideous whatnot
committed to a lowdown sisyphus uprock
are shaving at a truck stop aging exponentially
homie no myth flowers grow where he piss
and i still row boats outta bottles without abandon
to shrink into the sunset bumping pachelbels canon
in d motherfucker the author of the artistry
may or may not be weeping to an automated pharmacy
hello hello shit

too geeked up to even keep it down
too peaced out to even be around
too beat up to even breathe it out
too freaked out to even leave your house xfive

you wish you could dance more i wish you would talk less
my gentleman transformed to bringers of offed heads
moments of land war my lazarus species
tattered and bruised up from back in the cheap seats
hackers on crew cuts foam at the mush mouth
gag at the news truck notably unsound
dragging his clown shoes food in his moustache
raggedy hounds tooth zilch on a bus pass
im good house at the beach of expelled hubcaps
black lawn backyard melting into lovecraft
bad yarn spun by the hum of the bug zapper
of kings becoming runners and runts becoming alphas
and underdogs with posters of a frontside tony alva
on the sticker laden walls above their uncles bowie albums
graduate to flyers of an execrated sigil
and live to see another sexy generation fizzle
out keep rap homely
bear claw slippers oversized billy joel tee
fatfaced potbelly neckbeard crows feet
rat nest gross teeth pock marks go team
i walk with hawaii on a greenscreen behind me
so even the awkward pauses feel inviting
standing at a landmark sleep drought keep out
cant talk now too freaked out

hey kirby
whatcha doing kirby
whatcha doing there
hey kirby
whatcha doing kirby
whatcha doing there

hobgoblin shots of hot strongid
vaccine queen deem church socks hostage
nine weeks awesome hides in a slipper
look in her eye like she might be a wizard
cold met a cat lady in a parking lot
she got the heroes of tomorrow in a cardboard box
and probably hoarding forty more in the corners of fort knox
swap twenty on the spot and cop the warlock
back at the haunt found god in the hamper
briefs on her head playing walking with a panther
good around misery and golden era samplers
jeopardy and wheel at the heels of her handlers
bet more than a pet to worship
its an md recommended sense of purpose
here to bat around keys and the means to euphoria
soon to be hailed the greatest of all warriors

hey kirby
whatcha doing kirby
whatcha doing there im not takin no shorts
hey kirby
whatcha doing kirby
whyd you eat that leaf

homie dont fetch only woke to stretch
under a thought bubble rich with bowls of goldfish
skittish in the company of stranger danger
otherwise chase draw strings tails and lasers
in a steel cage match with a maze of cables
brazen gameface based on azazel
oversized ears up puke in the meow mix
shred a pair of earbuds remedy his cowlick
 thanks kirbs looking like a milli
keep an old man sharp keep a cold chantilly
spun plum dizzy in a frisky moment
never lands on her feet though i think shes broken
mouser in training nap on the toaster
decorate her cubicle with dogs playing poker
fifteen years taking prescriptions
now a shrink like ionno maybe get a kitten

hey kirby
whatcha doing kirby
whatcha doing there
hey kirby

i take ten steps with a bent left vision
study the disorders weve absorbed inside the village
i understand the plagues and why they shake hands with my grimace
then remain up in my face like top to bottom train car fillins
lets question the ascension of a broken social icon and bury its domino affect
imma blow this hex over the mission
just to administer the endall sucker punch toward its pitiful condition
crayz walz
with no alibi love is used as a guide by the civilized
some see it as the body heat you feel when you close your eyes
thats so much of a lie you can leave your hair dyed and scorch your roots
as the truth hits your ears begin to cry
why is it like this why the fuck do i care
i dont have the answers or at least the ones you want to hear
city lights look like bright groups of fire flies
many see the truth the proof only when the liar dies
tires screech to a halt the ground cries
spit sparks speak to the streets
the skid marks are replies
read discussions of what we rode through entrenched in the vocals
the hopeless stay hopeful the toxic fumes choke you
as i walk out my door step into the pollution
i breathe in the problems exhale solutions
physically the situations hard to stop
i had a wicked jump shot and sold crack rock on back blocks
casualties in this apocalypse street chronicle
abnormal abdominals pushups phenomenal
relaxin drinking my sixpack maxing
faxing my thoughts on the satellite via donahue push it
table talk salt and pepper conversation
integrated sectors metropolis and mecca
its a conspiracy you know i cant lie dukes
sometimes i feel the rats got a better deal than i do
aesop rockchorus
it goes thieves bandits low lives scum
punks that buckle under the rumble of my drum
steadily searching for something new under the sun
but its stagnant active element first of madness
thieves bandits low lives scum
punks that buckle under the rumble of my drum
steadily searching for something new under the sun
but its hurtin act of development first diversion
crayz walz
a new universe in ancient so i stay patient
in a gravel pit travelin thoughts unraveling pacing
embracing light of america and found a shade of darkness underground
the traincar used to be my apartment
sick of people rushin in the doors before i get out
conductors closing the doors before i get in i shout
the blizzards coming the blizzards coming 
dont get worried now weve been in a cold world
we just getting flurries now
aesop rock
yeah its like sloooowww dooowwwn
youre movin much too fast to bust through the finale fashioned glass
its delicate demeanor and i teach you how to hang
but we like one thousand nine hundred and seventy something twenty kliks outside da nang dear obedience
i apologize for the faulty academics
but they placed us in a miserable stasis
i let bygones be bygones
but tryin to see eye to eye with the faceless
just aint working the way the manual paints it
see i soak in a blue note factory
while most cats hassle bandits lamping  solo
and when the last red brick topples over the earth
to intercept your crooked little mess
i can be found in a social coma directly to your left
engaged in a conversation a marvel with my breath
regarding how to document the shady baby steps
i bounce checks like a modern man
sleep with one eye open while the other two drift
together specimens from the promised land
this for the thinkers
this for the urchins allergic to they own stingers
this for the absurd verdict linkers
this for that cat at my shows thats always got prophetic opinions
but cant remember where his drink is
im wallowing shrugging im plugging your corporation
cause we alley cats addicted to the sickly warped sensation
answer this when all is said and done
are you a memorable trooper or just a lab rat on the run
choose one
chorus

somebody in a cultivated moment of distress
composed themselves enough to artfully carve zoso in his desk
they was probably thinking fuck you fuck you fuck you in they head
with a hell bound arm in a acidy wash
homemade curfew a thousand oclock
and the pot leaf tattoo his friend did drunk
like a badge of mystique though it technically sucked
taking the name of the father in vain
on the way to the blade in his locker
estranged
a switch he lifted from a siblings skivvy drawer
whod branched off into ninja stars
and never knew his shit was sharked to
here with a higher purpose
and a prime alert to juvenile berserkers
like crocea mors in a arcade drop claw
gouging a valentine for miss othmar

into the eye of goliath you go
that levy crushin percussionll pull the monkey upright

it would appear you spelled out all the answers

when they ask how you feeling you tell em you feeling like
something important died screaming you tell em you feeling like
something even more important arrived breathing something you should probably try feeding
when they ask how you living you tell em you living like
something important died hissing you tell em you living like

something you should probably try willing

somebody in a cultivated moment of distrust
composed themselves enough to magicmarker zulu on these chucks
they was tryin to do the buckle font from renegades of funk
in a threed frame of exploding brick
and whizlines for the locally motion sick
beyond gross but evoked a host of oh dip
where a social neurosis owned the whole strip
heart of a cat with a lark in his mouth
in the marrow of waiting his guardians out
flashlight
chisel tips
milked venom
pistol grip
images relocated from milled vellum to scissor kick
silent agreement at hand
king of the hill for a queen of the damned
she in the doorway seething began
that clean white pair had a threeyear plan
oops

truly to beautiful loser it up u and he done
collateral damage a future alum that key to shambala
planet rocking bambaata

churning out a cancer for the vandal squad

animated colors on a page
like synthesized cultures on a stage

somebody in a cultivated moment of resolve
composed themselves enough to publicize the zeros in this stall
they was scoping every dog and pony previously scrawled
with a festering hate for the gum drop edge
disco sucks tee punks not dead
but a transient teen unsung godsend
via three bar chords and a mugshot grin
cheese
sign of a runaway tone in the face of authority thumbing its nose
cutting its teeth
pretzled up in special order vinyl and
birds that dip their belts in little metal porcupine quills

we saw them rat races machine or man sprocket or fat laces
hatchback of flashbacks from a heyday full of bad blazers
now major aes route the following order
to all his crews chromed generals
food clothes medicine

walk on glass bang on doors
talk all trash hang on whores
walk on cash bank on wars
like food clothes medicine its yours
its yours its yours its yours

we rotate protocol on a ring finger neighbor to peruse gross negligence
food clothes medicine
martyrs leak faster if the carver tweaks the dagger ninety moves choked citizens
food clothes medicine
well yats a quick example accept as commitments castle cool dope excellent
food clothes medicine
its tough to legislate when scum tongue down a dinner plate of booze coke heroin

ill bite the hand that feeds
chew the steak and spit the knuckles back
stitch em up and give em dap before his brothers rubberneck
iron chef lithuania christen kitchen stadium
with chicken and mass serotonin drifting into gravydom
save me some scallywags hold your breath
the curmudgeons gun dusty like the road to death
bag a pin stripe my lizard kisser no kill switch
just a guilty gizzard wanna recommend a pill slip
i wipe placenta off my face in the height of the disco era
cruise through liquid bubble gum fever death and christmas sweaters
through juice saccharin fast food studied holdin cliffs notes vendors
now holds a bachelors in training ninjas to tip toe better
these are them sham city kidney kicks to the loose bolts
belly achekillins for claim who stand iffy on food clothes medicate
pollywog hug a spot lit with bigger lizards
in the land of hot milk and honey with stingers in it
zinger
jimmy to jist up check ya tip cup
mothers watching babies near to preachers keen on fist fucks
keep your schnoz clean ears open chopper zipped up
food clothes medicine cause hungry naked sick sucks
collide your worker ants with autobahn inertia dance
and curb them herbie love bug by the cursive final curtain clamp
another savior with his foot cold stuck in his mouth
i played that who knows food clothes fuck it im out

flash that buttery gold
jittery zeitgeist wither by the watering hole what a patrol
what are we to heart huckabee art fuckery suddenly
not enough young in his lung for the water wings
colorfully vulgar poacher out of mulch
like ima pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt
fine sign of the time we elapse
when a primate climb up a spine and attach
eye for an eye by the bog life swamps and vines
they get a rise out of frogs and flies
so when a dogfights hogtied prize sort of costs a life
the mouths water on a fork and knife
and the allure isnt right
no score on a wartorn beach
where the cash cows actually beef
blood turns wine when it leak for police
like thats not a riot its a feast lets eat

and i will remember your name and face
on the day you are judged by the funhouse cast
and i will rejoice in your fall from grace
with a cane to the sky like none shall pass
none shall pass none shall pass

now if you never had a day a snow cone couldnt fix
you wouldnt relate to the rogue vocoder blitz
how he spoke through a nodoz motor on the fritz
cause he wouldnt play rollover fetch like a bitch
and express no regrets though he isnt worth a homeowners piss
to the jokers who pose by the glitz
fine sign of the swine in the swarm
when a king is a whore who comply and conform
miles outside of the eye of the storm
with a siphon to lure out a prize and award
while avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war
true blue triumph is more
like wait let him snake up out of the centerfold
let it break the walls of jericho ready go
sat where the old cardboard city folk
swap tales with heads like every other penny throw

and i will remember your name and face
on the day you are judged by the funhouse cast
and i will rejoice in your fall from grace
with a cane to the sky like none shall pass
none shall pass none shall pass

you tried you tried you tried to trick me
youve got a youve youve got a a lot of nerve
im im not im not trying to trick you
im try im try im trying to help

okay woke to a grocery list goes like this
duty and death any one object come stand in the way
you could be my little snake river canyon today
and i ran with a chain of commands
and a jetpack strapped where the backstab lands if it can
fine sign of the vibe in the crowd
when i cut a belly open to find what climb out
thats quite a bit of gusto he muster up
to make a dark horse rush like enoughs enough
it mustve struck a nerve so they huff and puff
til all the kings men fluster and clusterfuck
and its a beautiful thing
to my people who keep an impressive wingspan
even when the cubicle shrink
you got to pull up the intruder by the root of the weed
ny chew through the machine

and i will remember your name and face
on the day you are judged by the funhouse cast
and i will rejoice in your fall from grace
with a cane to the sky like none shall pass
none shall pass none shall pass

july five one thousand nine hundred and seventyseven
detroit michigan
porter you a real nigga man

it all started with a starter coat
the starter pistol got us out the momma jokes
the house party finally started now its time to go
get some pussy sponsored by the barber and a bar of soap
im stealing cars it wasnt logical
but on the bright side they taught us how to drive em doe
we used to tilt them bitches with screw drivers
so im kinda used to being at the bottom of your columns ho
but the billboard list was kinda comical
how the fuck was it designed and chronicled
i can see it now for sho
bunch of blasés from a buncha artists with a timeless flow
gettin trampled over on a twenty year old blogger flow
if pac aint on your list then you aint fuckin logical
im talkin up the shit not no fuckin five or four
what you gon tell me when i tell you
pac introduced me to the fuckin unlv starter coat
it all started with a starter coat
wonderin why brenda threw that baby in the garbage fo
on my way to cop my navy blue starter coat
it all started with a starter coat
the starter pistol kept niggas out here from startin smoke
without it id be dead or be an artichoke
the nine iron armor in the heart of gold its that fo
nobody witchu nigga thats the art of war lets go to war
but do not forget you fuckin start it doe thats my mama
woah what kinda coat is that starter coat

i grew up with three brothers
as soon as i was born my lungs collapsed
and i had to be hooked up to a ventilator

now a nigga shining though
growing up i gave a lotta niggas shiners though
i gave a lot of people my respect
daddy taught me that one growing up
he threw me through a shower door
i used to wonder why my uncle looking startled fo
crawlin around all on the ground like his heart is broke
i found out he got a crack problem
and he thought he dropped a couple particles
well im a fucking alcoholic so who am i to judge
im just honorable i be temporarily in love when im inside a ho
im a pure artist i dont need to see the charts
to know the art is under our control
highs lows problems pain drama thats whats optimal
i guess im just the best at thanking god
and feeling awesome though
cause i survived the era of the starter coat
it all started with the starter coat
i lost my virginity aboard the fucking boblo boat
i aint graduate on time i aint go to college so
a couple friends of mine did other friends of mine dead
im fuckin reminded just because i made the most money
that dont mean i went the farthest though
i hope my college friends reminded
you got degrees that dont mean you the smartest though
mo money mo problems
i lost plenty mo marbles on my marble floor
then i left in my starter coat
what they taught us that was all a joke
you may not got a lotta dollars at least you got a post
im arguing with satan screaming i dont barter souls
please dont take my memories of me and my starter coat

what kind of coat is that starter coat
what kind of coat is that starter coat
what kind of coat is that starter coat
what kind of coat is that starter coat

right off the rip nobody could fuck with me
im out of space mind and body my soul and so on
mami im fly is an understatement come to greatness

im on my own planet ill do my own thing

right off the rip nobody is quite like me
you gon need a nasa spacecraft to sight me
if you dont like me bite me
i could give a fuck less fighting excites me
leaning on the moon with a patron fifth
playing my own shit and i sound terrific
im not cocky im beyond that
its time to start another hobby im beyond rap
run and tell your baby daddy and your son ray
im hot i sunbathe on the sun bae
im the one on the one way
hands and pretty long legs from the runway
my nigga nauny is a genius
you gon need a ladder just to climb on my penis
got two words for the rap game fuck yall

im on my own planet ill do my own thing
then turn around and pat myself on the back for doing good
i dont need nobody else im gon do it by myself
say what you wanna say but stick to the facts its all good

right off the rip you thought it was a wrap for me
didnt you go ahead and admit it hater
cold as ice im a living refrigerator
the reason hip hops breathing the defibrillator
i did a bid just for drunk driving
itll never happen again cause now im drunk flying
im an innovator when i say im on venus
i dont mean that im dating the tennis player
im on saturn where you dont matter
alone im past the zone where your phone scatters
hello can you hear me now
you dont got a fucking choice
i elbowed my way into everybodys conversations
with rhyming timing and patience now im in space bitch
i used to have to be on some watch what i say shit
but now you gotta take it

im on my own planet ill do my own thing
then turn around and pat myself on the back for doing good
i dont need nobody else im gon do it by myself
say what you wanna say but stick to the facts its all good

they say a closed mouth dont get fed
i say a closed mouth dont give head
on the flip side know a closed fist dont get bread
and if you swing it then you gon get lead
boy i put em in a panic got em all frantic
overlook my antics youll see that im a throwback
hip hop stan smith but it lessen my love
cause the socalled rulers aint quite measuring up
now let me give the chicks a message
bitter exesll tell you that the dick is precious
three words get over it
and if you speak mine mention i could trip over it
low key like my name too big for the bill
betty white style get it in still
plus im on the high you cant fit in the pill
but i try anyway we gon die anyway ya heard

im on my own planet ill do my own thing
then turn around and pat myself on the back for doing good
i dont need nobody else im gon do it by myself
say what you wanna say but stick to the facts its all good

i was also gon ask about your fear as an individual
you know its plenty of people
feel a sense of security around you and kinda lean on you
you ever feel like a certain amount of pressure from that
do you ever get afraid
of course i do i mean everybody gets afraid sometimes
what possibly could make you afraid
what are you afraid of afraid of afraid of

im afraid im afraid
sometimes im even afraid to admit
im afraid im afraid of the weight of my problems
haters workin overtime eight or nine jobs worth
all these wanted ski masks niggas
old basketball shorts under jean ass niggas
need to know im a product of a dead poet rhyming at his low
equals mya angelou my emphatic flow can rise the status quo
lying on the padded floor addict at its best
eradicated from the fabricated
afraid of the thought of releasing music thats indicative
of where im at in life will they like will they hate
the better question is if they hate it is you down to pay the price
ill look you right in your eyes and say you motherfuckin right
dont bother me with adversity
i conquered more ground than king kong could
all i think about these days is mom good
cause she diabetic my daddy just had a cancer scare
and do he still work at the post office the answers yeah
im introverted knowing that its not about oz
bigger problems outside

theres a war going on outside
that no man is safe from
you see you can smile
but that wont change the color of your skin
but im the sinner im the sinner
yet you kick me punch me say dont trust me
shoot me down like im up to something
fuck with me and say ive deceived you
but hows that legal
am i that evil why do you hate me

im afraid of you going to college and not acknowledgin
im your father cause you not proud enough
but i fought hard to make sure you never see certain things that im a product of
its easy to confuse being a father
with being a provider but all we got is us and im afraid to lose you
you the coolest kid i ever saw she did a good job with you
sometimes i hesitate to take credit for raisin you too cause all i did was discipline
i never taught you to ride a bike but we still a lot alike
and you makin music now i wonder what made you wanna give this a spin
you know what im about to say next right im afraid of you drinkin
though i never taught you to swim im afraid of you sinkin
i know i taught you to fight you aint in condition to win this
you wired different
you just aint the nigga you friends is its scientific
not my opinion so you know you genetically predisposed
to more than just eating soul food so im afraid of you to try to risk it
you in a gene pool with a lot of sick fish
and im the sickest of them all alcoholics die when they stop from the symptoms of withdrawal
look out the window tell me what you see
police shootin brothers the color of you and me
and they actin like they hate us so you may just wanna love yourself enough to compensate it
if i can say this say this one thing this one thing nonrelated
you were never ever ever better than me in basketball
pffft hahaha yeah right sure

to get they name out they willin to get the lube
that balmain fit me like my religion true
call my assistant tell him im slippin im spittin jewels
somebody come out and get them like them memphis dudes
we independent while yall flash bitches
we in the trenches ball sack lickin addiction yall need interventions
the gas pedal mashin the carpet in them sl benzes
the dash retarded like the special olympics
the needle leanin past the finish line like lance armstrong
im exotic smellin like your baby momma vagina bonfire island
a creed avensis
im not a killer im just stricken with a sickness called homicidalitis
flat screens surround me and my dubs seat up in my whip
so she can read her twitter mentions in three dimensions
its no such thing as flossin if you aint never seen the dentist
but some of yall need to take them gold slugs out of your face
load em in the pistol and shoot em the fuck into outer space
maybe i aint rich as you which is cool
maybe i aint weird as you which is cool
maybe it aint a style to be lyrical

i dont give a motherfuck i just get your mother touched
i pick my own date pay my way call that double dutch
i grip the ass i dump the tip call that shit the double clutch
wax on wax off clean that ugly stubble up
bonsai truth is gonna unlie at sunrise
your makeups running ubers gonna catch you when it comes by
you boys are entertainment i understand you like the bitch
but you are pretty famous sweater like the one cosby
wore at his arraignment uh i stay patient
pray gracious made millis while billi racin
now they wanna trade places as my ceiling raises
my prime lays dormant they computerized not i
see im straight torrent i clock in write it with my pen out my acorn
and then i clock out and leave a black cloud on all eight corners
started with us to hear the pop loud  robin harris house party
i bet yall acquit it like a child killing cop trial
all you see on the ground is an empty rock vials
like tommy lee and pam anderson im  in the trump tower
with this here piece manners here magnum condom fit like juelz santana
bandana gear i used to need antifreeze
she about to need antifrizz antifrizz
im pac and im nas when i famed danced to anti big

i feel like i fathered all of your bars like i came up in your grannys crib
the most interesting man on the god damn planet
beef is having a niggas bitch fix me some god damn salmon
beef is trying a niggas clothes on when he aint home
beef is your wife when kids at school texting me theyre gone
i just took a dip in your swimming pool which is cool
i think you need to find some more comfortable slipper shoes which is cool

if you love somethin let it go
if it comes back to you its yours
if it doesnt it never was
hold me down baby

either let me fly or give me death
let my soul rest take my breath
if i dont fly ima die anyway
ima live on but ill be gone any day
either let me fly or give me death
let my soul rest take my breath
if i dont fly ima die anyway
ima live on but ill be gone any day

hold me down niggas wanna know me now
didnt want to play with me when to show me how
no meow cause its all about the bark
let the dog loose baby its about to spark
light up the night like the fourth of july
niggas know when i let go niggas die
with this y and you dont know you slow
like baltimore if you aint tryin to go you blow
i soak up all the pain and accept it in silence
when i let go its violence cause the wildest
is the dog barkin up the tree for the cat
in the fog what yall niggas see is the bat
flappin away but im blind like stevie
niggas dont hear me still tryin to see me
stop bein greedy you heard what i said
let me go let me flow or im dead

either let me fly or give me death

if i dont fly ima die anyway
ima live on but ill be gone any day
either let me fly or give me death
let my soul rest take my breath
if i dont fly ima die anyway
ima live on but ill be gone any day

i sold my soul to the devil and the price was cheap
ayo its cold on this level cause its twice as deep
but you dont hear me ignorance is bliss and so on
sometimes its better to be thought dumb  shall i go on
yo on the real what the deal its a mystery
how is it i can live and make history
if you dont see it then it wasnt meant for you to see
if you wasnt born with it it wasnt meant for you to be
but you cant blame me for not wantin to be held
locked down in a cell where a soul cant dwell
this is hell go get the devil and give me the key
but it cant be worse than the curse that was given to me
its what i live for you take away that and im gone
theres a difference between doin wrong and bein wrong
and that aint right just keep it fair baby
put me in the air and ill take it there baby  yes

either let me fly or give me death
let my soul rest take my breath
if i dont fly ima die anyway
ima live on but ill be gone any day
either let me fly or give me death
let my soul rest take my breath
if i dont fly ima die anyway
ima live on but ill be gone any day

ima flow regardless because im an artist until im trapped
ima continue to hit the hardest whether i scrap or rap
give me dap but you aint my friend
i see it in your eyes you contemplate my end
you waitin for that bend in the road where you were told
that you would go when you were old and if you died young it was cold
sold not for nearly what it was worth
think back twentysix years be like what if his birth
was a miscarriage and i never existed
have i given somethin that if taken away youd have missed it
didnt know yet i persisted it was the call of the wild
i merely say whats in my heart and you call it a style
dont put it in a cage dont mistreat it
you say you hunger for knowledge here it is eat it
another song completed is another thought captured
let me do my thing i got it locked with this rap shit

either let me fly or give me death
let my soul rest take my breath
if i dont fly ima die anyway
ima live on but ill be gone any day
either let me fly or give me death
let my soul rest take my breath
if i dont fly ima die anyway
ima live on but ill be gone any day

or give me death
or take my breath
ima die anyway
but ill be gone any day
or give me death
or take my breath
ima die anyway
but ill be gone any day

i love her with all my heart
every vein every vessel every bullet lodged
with every flower that i ever took apart
she said that she would give me greatness status
placement above the others
my face would grace covers of the magazines of the hustlers
paper the likes of which that i had never seen
her eyes glow green with the logo of our dreams
the purpose of our scene an obscene obsession for the bling
she would be my queen i could be her king together
she would make me cool and we would both rule forever
and i would never feel pain
and never be without pleasure ever again
and if the rain stops and everythings dry
she would cry just so i can drink the tears from her eyes
shed teach me how to fly even cushion my fall
if my engines ever stall and i plummet from the sky
but she will keep me high and if i ever die
she would commission monuments on her bosom to him
or maybe shed retire as well
a match made in heaven set the fires in hell
and ill be

younger outstanding achieving upandcomers

one time missing sunshine will never hurt your soul

come these are the tales of the cool
guaranteed to go and make you fail from your school
and seek unholy grails like a fool
and hang with the players of the pool
fasttalking on the hustle

and no one will receive thee
so shed no tear when were not here
and keep your faith as we chase
the cool

cool

affirmative no further furnishing is needed
i believe we are completed dig
we all in agreement on the wallpaper
happy with the color scheme welcome to the crib
a two family habitat for humanity
with a view of where the insanity live
my vida loca was built like bob vila via god
he architected i arted what i harbored jimmy carter
from chicagos west side finish my construction now
we hold the coming like contracepts
im conscious cept the cons i kept
with conversations held with the satan on my shoulder
which lead to steps that kept me looking over the shoulder
like chauffeurs where my angels at
painful yet mary i aint jerry garcia ma
here but im grateful chuuch

we just might be ok after all
sun gone shine on this day

its finna get heavy as heaven
i am atlas at this manage to balance
massive masses pull my back with out tilting my glasses
this was not pilfered from passages of ogs this is so me
ask us many mention little homie little bony
but the rhymes is fat in fact
just like a rochester customer
god bless the mothers and younger brothers of hustlers
cause she dont wan sob at his wake
but he want to follow in his steps
bang his hat learn his shakes
master his swagger in the bathroom mirror
cop a chevy steady mob in his place
chyeah its just the problems we face
look his moms in her face and promise hes straight

we just might be ok after all
sun gone shine on this day

then he leaves the house that love built that
hud renovated that section eight pays for
well lets pray for em let the beat play for em
put his struggles on display for em
cause he gotta go and face the drama
with a different face from the one that he use
to face his momma if you look close youll see
it consist of a smile that hurts an ice grill and a trace of trauma
little bit of his father another criterion
thats no different from a young liberian
who let the delirium weary him living in the inner city
out of his mind liria reconcilia
im cool i dont foretell best
i aint nicest mc i aint cornel west
i am cornel westside chitown guevara
malcolm exorcise the demons gangsta leaning
he traded in his kufi for a new era
chose a fortyfour over a mortarboard
i aint a credited institute graduate i aint from nazareth
my conception wasnt immaculate i aint master no calculus
a good addition to the rap audience
i back flipped on the mattress they slept on me on
whaddown joe knowing is half the battle
fighting temptation have an apple
shakes the snakes pimp the system

weve seen so many towns
where the trains dont ever stop

aint no smellin what the rose got cookin
how many flights just got charged for rebookin
google maps backpacks wrong routes tookin
yet through all the bullshit we keep pushin
long as we got sweets that we can keep kush in
me and deac lost like change in seat cushions
tryin to find the right highway the high way
speedin to catch time stopped on a dime for
five fifty pound turkeys crossin inine
we lookin at the weed like we lost our mind

on the road again the journey to the unknown again
another episode when youre supposed to end
week after week test my patience
sleep deprivations the key to miss three destinations
passed out drunk couldnt speak every nations
itinerarys missing the weeks reservations
ill rest my feet where the peeps dont know the strange
lucky im a creep and the streets dont know my name

weve seen so many towns and i got so many memories
but one comes to mind the first time we hit up helsinki
we did the show and hit the afterparty
one girl hit the bathroom i went after probably
it was totally destroyed and i aint talkin about the feces
the toilet was lyin on the floor in pieces
she literally shitted in the toilet so hard
that it split and got obliterated had to get her load off

nothing but strangeness
nothing but strangeness
nothing but strangeness
nothing but strangeness

were down in jozi south africa greet our brethren
these women got me thinkin dirty thoughts like im devin
we night clubbin all of a sudden i got her hands inside my pants
sayin white boy where youd learn to dance
were at adelaide australia with our promoter lost
whats that pill on the pool table thats an e somebody dropped it
this is twopm without hesitation he drops it
like i felt like partyin anyways aw fuck it

in the rain we ran from miami hurricanes
and left lanes on autobahn lanes
with foot on the gas gps on the dash
while all the names looked the same on the signs we passed
weve chased beers on aspen streets
and caught eyes in alaska that lasted weeks
strippers took my mojo with cheeks in santa fe
and in the netherlands i was asked to pull santas sleigh

the tour gospel according to suffa
every city looks the same lookin up from the gutter
so hook me up with another round dude theyre lovin the sound
so much the groupies back stage give eachother a pound
meal recognize meal
and debris so hungry on the mechanized wheel
you got a set of ideals leave them shits on the tour bus
and serenade a beer like bitch just the two of us

nothing but strangeness
nothing but strangeness
nothing but strangeness
nothing but strangeness

one two
its masta ace cunninlynguists
we about to get into the seasons
the seasons of hip hop
how we gonna start it

as we spring back to the past it was all happening fast
we glorified coke and smoking crack in a glass
when bboys danced to the latest jam
you could say this man was the greatest fan
when shoelaces were fat and all the rappers faces were black
and lightbrown a box with the right sound was all you needed
when it blast they must move
you just proved youre hard like l in krush groove
and songs started to drop aint nobody start at the top
before preme learned the art of the chop
this is way before sps and mpcs
and long before cds and mpthrees
the game started to bloom and blossom
and masters ready for the cermony like a groom in costume
growth from the rain of the previous years
i took notes from what i heard through these devious ears
yeah

as summers heatwaves ascended in its splendid manner
green was flooding our scene although the skin was tanner
fuck the police jumpin over radio scanners
it was hot in the shade wet paint all over the canvas
fuck vanilla ice cones we had t cubes amerikkas most
and wanted that chronic on the leftcoast
talent pools were full and fresh for swimming
backstrokin through dark sides and illmatic beginnings
them lemonade stands would make you street platinum
it was two live florida crews caught heat for rappin
but free speech pollination kept bees colonizing in hives
and stung delores tucker right in her pride
the tribes ocean splash was rising the tide
strictly four my niggas that were ready to die in the ride
i wish the summers vibe couldve lasted forever
to bad we had to have a change in that weather that shit was beautiful

lauryn hill
seasons change mad things rearrange
ladybug
play me in the winter
play me in the summer
play in the autumn
any order

hit the clock hit the blinds hit the pine ay
nothing but the hits same shit different time ay
working out the kinks from the mind to the spine ay
shower water calling fluoride on the other line
phone jumping off the dresser
in a silent suicide
saved by the pile of designers on the side
she answers
her cousin with the body of a dancer
say they gotta chance to be in a video
with little young so and so
she swear hes about to blow
he signed and we dimes
so cuzzo we got to go
grab hair clothes makeup
garcia vegas
and flock them other birds
they gon pay us like we vegas
from rental to the highway to rental mansion driveway
greeted by a oily jeweled rapper looking shiny
eye like he used to bully ice cube on fridays
gripping on her waist and grinning in her face and
she just want her paper cause she feeling out of place and
couple propositions got her feeling for her mace
and her cousin brought her burner she aint trying to catch a case
so they split
tires burnin end of the street
with a grand
some of none for you and none for me
sometimes you gotta duck instead of flying in a v
fuck flying in a v

any way the wind blows xfive

she hit the clock hit the blinds hit the vape ay
bout to hit the sky get the wand get the cape ay
working out the kinks but its love over hate
usually shower calling but today she got a date
with a clawfoot tub and a backrub
then her phone starts singing
as she bout to hit suds
hits cancel
but calls back
facetime
to ignore the moment is a hate crime
she mainlines
it was her cousin
talking bout some video
she jokes dont be out there acting like some city ho
and mo of her mamas quotes
through the smoke
cut through the weeds and the overgrowth
a rose
said cuz you my blood right right
you know that all that i say is love right right
you still wanna own a club right right
how bout we talking business under sunlight right

any way the wind blows xfour

deep sigh close the blinds hit the snooze ay
nothing but the hits same shit different tune ay
glued to the gloom with a mind full of blues ay
shower water running while she cries in her room
phone jumping off the dresser in a silent suicide
saved by the pile of reminders on the side
she doesnt pick it up
shes numb to the cuts and the wounds on her heart from a life in a rut
texts come in from her cousin but that doesnt interrupt
dark thoughts on her mind intertwined with the crushed
blue pills by the dozens
the only time she doesnt feel disgusting
is when shes home alone and she buzzing
clutching to a moment and atoning for something
she lays by the phone in a zone feeling nothing
uh
she reaches back to change the wax
as cannonball plays the sax
she fades to black

yo first i sprinkle the verse
by addin words rhymes
flippin em in a verse with lines
then imma hit em disperse rhyme venom
and then imma split em in half
feelin my wrath
venturin through parts of the south so dirty
youll want to be given a bath
itll take pathological liar to deny that im nice
and the truth hurts ow
wearin a blue shirt the best buy for the price
to get six guys this live and nice on the mic
so dont diss us because were fly
until you try what its like
im liable to slice at these emcee bastards
leaving their knees fractured
needin every piece of their teeth recrafted 
so dont front cause i see past it
youre harmless like wolverines adamantium claws
when theyre retracted 
if the scenes backlit
or seems static well wreak havoc
well beat batter to keep rappin
a leech battle a dream shatterer
for three nanoseconds 
count your paces one step to tonedeff
youre gone in sixty seconds like nicholas cage is

ill leave you riddled with basics
theres no need for complexity
to be beside myself i need god next to me
just kiddin
im partially bullshittin
the only time i take a loss pussy is when i lose kittens
i pitch shit past ya no matter whos hittin
i dont capsize boats
but i got crews flippin
you catch it the message needs analyzation
step and your boysll be pouring alcoholic libations
i flew sick you knew this
ill puzzle you doofus
fuck mentally
stretch you into a physical rubiks
itll take more than sticker rearrangement to change it
his language is so strange how do we contain it
you cant just paint this up upon the canvas
gotta get the mental picture
to begin to understand this
so anticipate defeat delete chances
got your heads speared on lances
doin burial dances 

im giving body language speech impediments
each uttered threat causes confident cats to stutterstep
cut a reputation down to sighs too raw for porn overdubs
plate of leftovers eat some warmedover thugs
a jaded wordsmith bleeding ghostwriters pens dry
getting on a rappers nerves corroding dendrites
when my thoughts connect you ought to step away fast
seems i gave cats adats the way they make tracks
forget a scare im not generous kid
spit society of nimh and indent it in lids
indie pennant is sick and this is just a quick reminder
if you was to pick a cipher then ill bus your clique to rikers
all expenses paid no questions asked
ill get open in the cut and leave your flesh a gash
cant relax man the last time i took a breather
i got brought up on murder charges start the crooked fever

hey yo im not a fella to riff with
im so nice mr rogers sued my ass
for copyright infringement
roll with henchmen
that will switch heads
from wanna be thugs to two hundred and fortyseven bitch kids
topping my shitlist
producting cat bastards wantin jiggy beats
for some wack rappers
switch my style who you tryina play
my beatsll maraud yo ass any time of day
like deuce bigalows chick
whenever you do shit
people see you and holler thats one huge bitch
shit when the lp rolls out
the sourcell be forced to make the quotables
a threepage foldout
no doubt im fed up with this wack shit
bombin the next kid wearin abercrombie and fitch
and any jiggy rapper actin fly on the radios
gettin pulled out of rotation like a firestone radial

kashal tee the hip hop scene i phatten
not even my winners belt keeps my jeans from saggin
it seems im braggin
but fiends been naggin for my next release
i apply all my expertise and make em extra pleased
even get the vexed appeased i make any brother feel this
all i do is independent like double helix
sellin out well i hope that youre not
but how else could you afford all the soap that you drop
you cant fuck wit me yo kid look
takin me out aint no small feat you aint bigfoot
you should know who the heck youre facin
cause my reputation leaves no room for speculation
now battle is that you want to do
what kind of man are you
i bet you sit on the urinal too
now that its proven to you
they got a lot to tell us
nimh got your heart skippin beats like acapellas

i be a cryptic author
writing poems on tombstones
celphtitled the nigga you couldnt bring home 
im at the crib wit your bitch givin me slow head
split you up in more pieces than when jesus broke bread
my clique is raw be prepared when you meet us
kill an unborn baby and you still couldnt defetus ooh
i dont battle with rhymes
id rather battle with nines
instead of using my mind
id rather shatter your spine
the closest you ever came to a punch line
was waitin for refreshments at the prom in eightynine
im super crafty super nasty super raspy
fuckin bitches with super asscheeks
you fucking faggots dont know what raw speech is
i beat a bitch until her whole body turn to cleavage
im hyperactive so i drink decaffinated
my left jab is fatal leavin cats decapitated

i am phallaxor the matter lord
master of war with plasma swords
massive in form with acid pores
mad for the taste of your planets core
gnashed in my teeth and i plan to hoard galaxies worth
im a savage
bored naturally because the lack of sport saddens me
im a galactic force
who dares to battle when standing before me renders you halved
when i warp through parallel paths to distort your atoms order
the galaxian matador dash at me
within a flash youll see packs of me
thatll be swarming within an asteroid storm
here is your last chance warning then i wont ask no more
did you get that
then ill hit you with that celestial bitchslap

perpetual impact that your mind cant shield
weighing in at a gillion parsons its zarcon steele
tentacles tatter your tissue till torn tender to the gristle
the pitiful pray for the victim i evict the veins of the victor
no matter the matter youre made of it contains the brains that i make haze of
thoughts youre thinking you thought are those brought to those that i make slaves of
the pecs your appendages pump is the hunk of flesh that i make caves of
imprint the pattern of saturn across your face like its makeup

you better wake up
you speaking of saturn  you late much
if youre reading the data its eight months till you see where the flash and the rings of my championships came from
now you want lightspeed
say what
there is no one like me likely so it doesnt take much
if youre taking up space and youre in need of a weight cut
ill sever your tentacles then ill make em a paintbrush
staining a blood moon
creative within one swoop  parted in four
the cosmic artist of war you could say that i was sun tzu
plotting the gore
onetwo
you can hold my weapons ill punch through your core defenses
then im shattering your orbital bone
while knocking the solar wind out of your solar plexus

youre outta your mind this marble is mine
to break into dust and do as a line
or roll it with space and lace it with time
right after i separate you from your spine
im here to perpetuate your demise
i savor the hint of hope in your eyes
when im done im sticking my dick in a black hole and creating the sun
to shine down on your grave from
wherever the fuck i came from
pimping this planet from day one
your earth chose me
zarcons so far gone in your galaxy balls deep
weight of the world fate has been hurled
too close within arms reach

my baby needs a diamond sky
caviar and moonlight wine
she hasnt yet been up on my
if shell take me

she got me chasing dreams shoe strings tied together
while niggas flaunt her for quarters dont want her but need the cheddar
but i cant fall playa for her letting him slay her
while this broad out in a brawl in more houses than prayer
yearning for affection but burning with no protection
cause every bit of bread i make im earning for bill collection
instead of pitching in she switching men but come back to me
cause she know when i freak her the speakersll come factory
lost jobs behind time spent on love
these chicks didnt mix with  men hard love
got me flaming trees cough and i name them trees
speaking on past relations that became emcees
but financially i lack the jack to tame them needs
theres other fish in them but i aint trying to sell them seeds
i aint no fisherman just out looking to poll please
but a man only stand so much begging on both knees

i said i give this bitch my time dedicate my grind to her
offering my best sweat bent all these lines  her
this bitch a dime and she know it hard to get chicks
bills but plays tricks plus cars they get slicks
sliding past like opportunity i try to catch them
but im using both hands to hold up my world
riding fast is consuming me id die to fetch her
boy i aint a man if i dont marry this girl
the swirl of joy and pain sunshine and rain
feeling like a player missing open layups in the game
is it a shame to sacrifice my logic over pussy
been trying to help common save this ho since is a rookie
its feeling like a lost cause all yall got her on some bullshit
that  nappy roots im like aw naw
but i want her to stay because i love how we lay
lady keep fucking with a nigga let me show you the way

these days they want to be criminals more than they want to commit crime
thatsthats not just crime thats the way of the world

theres something about a vandals lust
the lifestyles of the scandalous
aint nothing like it  america loves gangsters ha ha ha ha
look at all the angel dust the cocaine and the cannabis
aint nothing like it  america loves gangsters he he he he
hate stones but the man you trust
cause its fun to watch cannons bust
aint nothing like it  america loves gangsters we we we we
gone off that gangsta gangsta twox for so long
gone off that gangsta gangsta twox and so on

america loves gottis america loves bodies
pacino counting cnotes for shooting up club lobbies
while eddie nash controls bankrolls in wonderland
tony soprano hits channels and holds down ondemand
we wanna see it and some motherfuckers gon wanna be it
others are doing numbers that breed it bleed it cant defeat it
bush the political gangster man you gotta be high
gave plenty of orders for slaughters aint swatted a fly
modern day cowboys with shiny alloys for side arms
hiding behind bombs advanced cowards
in jesse james ways we handled the towers
guns blazing for freeze framing the king of new york
in the moments we face opponents give thanks to gangsta
maybe place babyface nelson in ranks to bank ya
got enough angst to handle the handle and squeeze the trigger
but pop that in the city its freeze nigga

ascareica lusts danger danger danger
war load the tanks up
in the name of the lord give thanks for anger
more major paper in gangsta gangster
heats nerves and veins hearing words from pranksters
anger anchors us cinematic screens spew
wrangler language systematic schemes too
change the brain up divide and conquer
mob on em ride till their lives are contrad
monsters driven by capital as a stimuli
can never be too powerful it makes us all admire you
well follow until we fall like fallen star from sky i
cant say its impact hasnt hollowed walls inside my
heart my art ummmm insane
is it that smart to react dark when facing pain
you aint that hard that scarred or that real
to go that far for that kill for that feel now thats ill

its sixpm again
and im tuning into cnn watching marines mow down
crowds with machine guns
sixteen weeks training atilla the huns philosophies
and now theyre thinking we wont bring peace to these
streets with the same techniques that shits hypocrisy
this aint democracy its a survival of the fittest
a country built behind closed doors with gods as their witness
picture this
people can become so blind that their ears cant listen
trying to save their souls with penitentiareligion superstition
never done unto others but claiming that theyre christian
while gods children are sittin home praying and wishing
for answers to their questions
herd of the armageddon wondering what side that were destined
life be a war aint no time for restin
thats why you give up your seven to five just to stay alive
trying to fuel the fire inside before the god in me has died
eyes wide trying to look out through this labyrinth
hoping to leave this earth with the same presence that we came with
trying to steer my path in opposite on opposite directions
that man came went
my soul came spent i tried to get it back
thinking that if my heart stopped that my body could relax
but theres no time to be laxed
because theres a war all through creation
gods warriors are dying and gangsters are their replacements

at night in my window i see your silhouette
crying heavy tears look how wet my pillow gets
throughout my days i dont smile i just get upset
and since you left look at all the shit that it affects
i take a picture of your face and i just hold it up
kiss it then reminisce on when it was both of us
its hard for me to open up im always talking to myself
but to nobody else
some say that church or maybe counseling could probably help
but they dont know about all of my idiotic lies
all the fucking times i left you traumatized
swore up and down to you saying ima try
and never did i try not to cry but i feel bad i didnt apologize
its time i cough it up and tell more my soul is taken never sell yours
i did some shit i probably coulda been in jail for
bury me deep inside hells core
and dont let me out until you hear bells roar

she said you never loved me you just controlled me
if you fuck around im calling the police
but all i wanted to say was im sorry
oh how i wish that could tell you

youre gone youre dead
youll never know that i was sorry
just leave me alone stay out my head
i wish that i could tell you
youre gone youre dead
youll never know that i was sorry
just leave me alone stay out my head
i wish that i could tell you

its hard to forget my heart is a brick
i tell myself marcus i thought that you were smarter than this
the mess i put you through was worse than pearl harbor and shit
id always harm you and flip mentally scar you and trip
sometimes id argue and get the nerve to call you a bitch
then bruise your back against the dresser that i tossed you against
my juliet at the time i never thought you was it
i do now but shit youre gone so i just offer you this
a song to you through it i open the crack in my chest
and show the whole world ive always had a lack of respect
for women who enter my life i look to vengeance as knife
intentions to fight if you thinking i was senseless you right
now every sentence i write i think twice on it so i dont regret
cause only stress lies in a sinful mind of loneliness
im an unholy mess put me in a hole to rest
welcome to my life this is how painful my stories get

she said you never loved me you just controlled me
if you fuck around im calling the police
but all i wanted to say was im sorry
oh how i wish that could tell you

youre gone youre dead
youll never know that i was sorry
just leave me alone stay out my head
i wish that i could tell you
youre gone youre dead
youll never know that i was sorry
just leave me alone stay out my head
i wish that i could tell you

now use this track as a lesson
all you guys out there who have some aggression
towards your woman it dont have to get hectic
that crap is pathetic now look at me i have to regret it
i cant go near her or nothing shell probably have me arrested
the only thing i could do is just make a track with a message
and hope she hears it so she could know i was badly affected
i never meant to be that type of guy
but i realized that i was and because of it im throwing my sinister life aside
i can cry at any moment just thinking about it
sometimes i hide it from the folks that im hanging around with
i should apply for a new soul cause i think its invalid
somebody told me when i die ill be safe but i doubt it
the grudge she holds against me it hurts me so severely
she wont come near me i thought that time was supposed to cure me
im so alone and weary writing songs to heal me
i swear that im sorry heather i mean it so sincerely

she said you never loved me you just controlled me
if you fuck around im calling the police
but all i wanted to say was im sorry
oh how i wish that could tell you

youre gone youre dead
youll never know that i was sorry
just leave me alone stay out my head
i wish that i could tell you
youre gone youre dead
youll never know that i was sorry
just leave me alone stay out my head
i wish that i could tell you

just cause im buzzing off the white contacts
dont mean you should take your ass to hot topic to buy a pair

in the gutter cause im a thug and their tough just struck

givin you love from a slug if you bug on a nigga
tug on a trigga no hugs ima kiss her with
grudges and plug her with drugs when i give her dick

tech nninene

this is my haiku

the sick pedophile
touching beautiful kiddies
really gonna die

i think the world needs more light
cause what they do in the dark too heinous for your sight
and mine is dark all the time
a sign to design true crime
but im blessed to have the platform for this rhyme

damn why wasnt the light on baby girl
grown men touch her she four livin in this crazy world
thats gonna affect her way longer than the lightest life span
if i was there id be sparking way more than a light man
but if we shine em all together we can run them off
gonna hardslide on everyone he come across
molotovs go to slavery in the holocaust
lotta chalk you aint lit up then you not a boss
light the darker alleys it might just spark a rally
for right these hearts are rowdy tonight we spark the valleys
in flatlands stoppin the bad man with grab hands
girl he groping go in the trash can
nowhere to hide i must say places aint light enough
you try to cut the bright of us an idol just might erupt
the fine of dusk would light as the night adjust
if you got em then light them up

if there was a lighter in everybodys hand
the world would seem brighter
the sky would be fire
wed raise our hands and burn the world
so raise your hands and burn the world

hey
why did adam shoot the school up
maybe cause the way he grew up
maybe cause of loose screws
scratch all that cause mama loved to pick the tool up
now the marathon blew up
and its by the hands of two nuts
when castro took the kids for about ten years and what he done i almost threw up

if them was my youngins id try to bring the sun in
closer to em turn it up a hundred and hold it to em
take a bite and chew em
some of they baby life they ruined
id be going crazy on the daily
daily id pursue them
dont need more reasons to turn this to a fire pit
barbecue i would do right find without all of it
its awful and off to no resolving it
molotovs make the night brighter

yeah
depressin is cnn was heaven cause we had sinned
the reverend is begging brethren to be sevens and being friends
tecca dont wanna see kiddies die
minors on the stretcher so what you gonna do with them twentyfive lighters on your dresser
yes sir shine them bright so they see us off in mecca
lessen the threats of mfers steppin with death impress us
to mess a good will divide up a fight
being right and polite come and help me light up the night
shine your light bright pedophile he cant rape her
people stand together make the place safer
no time to play when i weigh the straight haters
cause they fakers and doing evil is they nature
this is for  that once and often go through my head then i wanna run then off them
i dont want no second opinions so im asking her friend
just keep it lit so this dont happen again

if there was a lighter
the world would seem brighter brighter
fire fire
burn the world
burn the world

a wonderful musician once said
if the people who are trying to destroy this world arent taking a day off then why should i
i feel that
so how do i light up the darkness mr bob marley
this is my attempt right here
im trying

this is dedicated to my kids
aliya  yates and dontez antonio yates

as i blaze the pm i inhale with the scent of a million men
i exhale with dumpin seventeen up in the front i am
in the midst of a crisis god knows all the sacrifices i made
might have to heist to get paid in spite
but cant just the price that a nigga played bitch made
niggas think they know me they dont know me
they phony funny but they dont know
that im that ill type nigga thatll open that gut
not much luck
im feelin stuck with a capital s
hit the cess killed the stress
rottin away in the midwest i guess
they was right when they said i was such a psycho sight
sick inside a slight
deliver that makes me want to go master p at night right
no more pain i complain and pray to god and stuffs
it was unbearable until i tried cocoa puffs
that chocolate thai got me willin to fly up in the sky
but when i lose altitude that high
makes me wanna just come down and die
whos responsible for this madness me
whos responsible for this sudden strike of sadness me
i can see
i can look into your eyes
smile and then to your surprise
ill be yellin die nigga die when all the bullets fly

pushin ten of them on top of the world like james cagney
feel that agony
people naggin me
my raggedy life aint worth livin
sick of my aunt and uncle draggin me
see me drink my life away smokin tokin my life away
tryin to put this trife away in the deepest darkest hide away
if i could fly today to the golden gates
i could get away from this place of hell and fakes
but it might be too late
what it gonna be dead

puffin that stronger wdouble ed that hunger
dont know how much longer ill be on this earth

and jump in the next city they wanted me just kidding
but i can never tell a lie if you look into my eyes you can see that im a
angel  demon
lookin for the love in every thigh makin you wanna cry spiritll be
strangled  screaming
that im a serial killer when it come to heartbreakin hate and the fury you better cynic and it starts makin
everything wrong everythings gone
so why do you say that you will forever dingdong
that just will make you much meaner thats some mistake to love nninena
it sucks to hate the one thing that makes you come clean
then breaks and just leave you
im just a fucked up individual
i love lust and crushin you for an interval
plus bust the gush off in a centerfold
eating a meaty muff like its a dinner roll
you should have kept away like i told you
how can you press to stay when im rover
i think its safe to say that my fates to lay and ima waste away when im older
so just step and give me the cold shoulder
cause im a mess the nninenas the most vulgar
and im a threat youll never get no closure
my kiss is killing you wake up and its over

why cant you see me for the animal i am i warned you
expose my beast inside yes dear you are willing to willing to willing to willing to
you took my invitation and they all told you never to take me in
why cant you wake up and see that i am killing you killing you killing you killing you

i never knew why i had to be so cold
inside of me so froze its gotta be no soul
because when the lady want me in oath mode
i put on my ghost clothes and get on a close road
im tryin to tell you that im sick in the encephalon
i thought i could do it but i guessin we can never bond
as long as im chasin the gold like a leprechaun
my heartll be covered in cold ice and teflon
im sick with it im brick with it nninene twisted it
ten times outta ten if you lookin for what it stems
i guarantee that you gonna find a bitch did it
but im takin it back i wont blame it on you
cause i be the one that be gamin on you

and god said let us make man in our image tech
according to our likeness nninene
let them have dominion over the fish of the sea
over birds of the air over the cattle and over all the earth

projected image across my soul saying cant die
many death situations but that aint why
i got the spirit of an angel mixed with demoniac ways of livin
so this means ill beat the evil out of a nonbeliever until praise is given
but i know
torture is evil though it says in the bible
you got to be righteous spirited for the arrival
im righteous and wicked but i wonder can i go
if theres a heaven but on earth its survival
connected with angels but to demons im vital
approachin with hate oh yes its homicidal
like denouncing selena at cinco de mayo
certain death oh no oh no
im on the road to heaven and hell
dont even bother me ever since eleven and twelve
ive been that prodigy though life has never been swell
somewhere theres gotta be where a good samaritan prevails
but they get straight sodomy
so i learned the ways of man
grands
fillin my pants
gun in my hand
for the demons on the land
on the other hand i really am
anghellic
i aint got to stress if you cant tell it
look into my eyes
no surprise
im half cupid half relic cha cha
he who treads the path of the beast is also he who sins are repentable
but if you ever ever ever ever heard of god then we gotta do away with the genitals
dont ever do somethin youll regret
do away with all these goody goody law abiding mothafuckas and let there be tech nigga

im loving the way your legs go so far back youre one of those flexible girls
i figure your daddy always said you was one of the best in this world
but nevertheless in this world im just professional girl
i teach em a lesson have em stressin and confessin to girls
how good it was and how good it could be if they just tried it
taking my double dosage skip the daily dick diet
tried it they so excited and cant hide it
im trying to do my thang but you gotta be quiet

now even when i just come in your house and cover your mouth because your momma is home
you grippin the sheets and making a effort not to holler and moan
you got to keep it on the hush cause we in no rush
you tellin me its the little things that mean so much
and its an illusion thinkin that you can match what i can do best
so if ya man call tell him to put some hair on his chest
but he dont even have to know we keepin it on the low
you walking it like a dog and stay working it like a pro so

imma taste ya neck and begin to nibble around your earlobes
down to your belly button then im unsnappin your bra thinkin your titties are tryna tell me somethin
hard nipples colder then icesicles
workin it with my tounge you can just tell me if it tickles
freaky deaky kinda sneaky ludacris and the gang
disturbin the peace we runnin the streets and steady slangin them thangs
but you gotta keep the noise down in order to keep the boy down
its joy all around and you know how it sounds if you just

as the crime scene evolves the doors are open the doors are open
look at you sister johnson in the front row
with thongs on your legs open tryna tempt me

and its all for the money
cause envy breeds jealousy jealousy breeds hate
they on the taste for the money

my biggest gift and my curse

getting audited by the government giving up millions to the irs
or having to take a paternity test from a bitch i never met
im getting sued by my own family member all cause my dog bit her
and she was the one who walked up and put her hand out and now she got her handout
its driving me crazy almost as if this shit was planned out
what else can anybody do to me it aint new to me when every time i turn around
another money hungry motherfucker suing me
truthfully ive had it up to here
and it dont help that forbes reports what im makin every year
they listen closely and i was really demonized
that i was told to go to school graduate and get a job
but im a hip hop cash king rapper from the south
and everybody wants the easy way out

yeah rappers foreclosin on their houses
cant keep up the payments they owe a couple hundred thousand
say they making millions and bills steady pillin
diamonds on their neck they kids stomach out here growlin
get your priorities in order nigga
you talk about it but you really cant afford it nigga
that car you bought depreciated once you drove off
no wonder your baby momma wanna knock your nose off blahhh

when im pushin ninety by myself up in the hov lane
they tryin to figure how many mo women that i can take on my plane
bein one of the few rappers responsible for changin the game
now desperate artists tryin to sue but they just makin some claims
cant get in the spotlight for nothin and it just makes em insane
thats why some of the niggas resort right back to bakin that caine
and sellin it off to junky monkeys who keep bakin they brain
as they grow older theyll be feelin a lot of achin and pain
so right at the head they might as well just be aimin that thang
and you aint helpin the process out by always cakin these dames
but it is hard givin up the place where they be shakin they thangs

and cats who know where all the hot lo gear is at
the stompin grounds where you find a pound smoke is that
be blazin charm that have your wave cap floatin back

if you rely on your skill then rely on your steel
if you have no ideal or any thoughts to feel
what you sought was real to give em slots to fill
busters stop to deal
but i face them quicker than takin a box of pills
now you gots to chill
get cops and sheilds steady hark the 
if theyre lookin for prey ready to stalk and kill

everything you ever heard of is not a myth
crazy dogs you dont ever wanna deal with

smoke a whole pound when i feel myself comin down
live how i wanna live and answer to no one

think again before you try and come and get me
or youll be shot up by a gang of gypsies shot

i sever heads just to sharpen my skills
zoom in on brains like a john carpenter kill
surprise thats the element your confidence is delicate
never recuperates i leave you mute and celibate
break the victim down to a jelly consistency
the brain twisted spits now tell me who gets with me
i felt they were listening and the smell of fear amps me
sweet tooth room full of candy wrappers i get antsy
mission activated attention captivated
vocals ring bring the socalled king on stage assassinated
youre nice where you from
thats the question i ask
distraction got struck pull their heart out their ass
the blast is nuclear when the crew appears
so seek shelter the only helpful advice
is that you should steer clear of the exits
i take reps and make messes
broken when the spot closes were off to breakfast
invested breath skills adrenaline
refill the gut then to my hut to build with the pen again
from hennepin to lexington the first section conquered
laid seeds in the soil peep the props and honor

its four hundred and thirty am do you know where your heads at
its four hundred and thirty am do you know where your heads at
its four hundred and thirty am do you know where your heads at
its four hundred and thirty am do you know where your heads at

cant expect everyone to see shit the way i see it
cant expect anyone to be dope the way i be it
so be it atmosphere leaks through like sunbeams
to snap you like a bungee when the sayers takes the country
hungry and this emptyness makes me grumpy
take an emcee stuff him between some bread cheese and lunch meat
its just a snack rely on ant to thrust a track
into the mind as i slip behind the whack and crush his back
must react if we dont we have no work
so i stomp them let his team remove remains up off the astroturf
now whos eager to be made a believer
it wakes the dead when i shake a rivals head until his teeth hurt
knee jerk when i yank your brain into a fever
and melt the weak channels in your receiver
you need to keep your beaver in your pants
fuck your leisure and your plans
i wear a van halen tshirt
bust a stance and crush your plans
its all inside the flows balance we figure well
your style has the personality of a speak and spell
you need development to reach the plateau im at
so take a fat step back so i dont mistake you as a bat

its four hundred and thirty am do you know where your heads at
its four hundred and thirty am do you know where your heads at
its four hundred and thirty am do you know where your heads at
its four hundred and thirty am do you know where your heads at

flight one hundred and one super jet service for pittsburgh and los angeles
will depart from gate twelve passengers may proceed into the
gate area for checking faded out echoing

oh yeah los angeles hot and bothered
helicopters watch their daughters play parking lot soccer
a whole lot of love from the targets hide
got a soul looking for a magic carpet ride
environment perfect for a hustle
many people are distracted by the puzzle
and while theyre not lookin the angel got tooken
welcome to the gray space between fingerprinting and booking
do your best cause the lesson is love
its enough to keep your head up another day to get up
wake up and let the sun shine through the smog
free the dialogue til everyone believes in god
la to some its hell to some its play
pay the cover charge and watch what you say
the barbie dolls caught body parts come off
and i think shes a hestop look at how it walks
they got the weirdoes the talent the beautiful
an arm and a leg for a onestory cubicle
and if the heat dont beat you the pigs will
everyones relaxed but no one can sit still
los angeles i love it i love it
lips glisten believe im gonna miss it
ill be back

ooh california highway california my way

i used to know this woman who had the most beautiful
tattoos on the top sides of both of her hands
she was fortythree years old and as far as i know
had never yet been with a man
its not that she wasnt attractive
she was beautiful but it was the way that she interacted
she was aggressively passive to the point where she
wouldve intimidated any mitt that ever tried to catch it
on the right hand she had a tattoo of a nude girl
she claimed it is what god resembled
but on the left she had a mirrored image of the same female
and this one she explained looked like the devil
i remember once watching her touch her own breasts
how the tattoos smiled as they stared down her stomach
as if anticipating when theyd be allowed to caress
the sweet flower that they both seemed too hunger sweet flower
now maybe i was high but it felt so right
heaven and hell both take to this womans womb
it didnt make sense how she could commence
touching herself with me wide awake in the same room
but if ive learned anything in my years my years
i learned i no longer believe in surprise in surprise
but what happened next damn near stole my tears
the tattoos came alive right in front of my eyes
they both slowly stood up and climbed off her hands
and showed me why she never took some time with a man
they climbed deep inside of this womans garden
she closed her eyes and she gently bit her bottom lip
i stepped i left and i dont regret leaving
and id never forget all the things i saw that evening
a glimpse of religion a piece of coming closer
to understanding more about what intrigues me most
i didnt get turned on i just got turned
i wasnt as aroused as i was concerned
for each one of em ive hurt
and every time ive been burned
ive got a lot to teach but even more to learn
so now i keep my eyes open hoping to take in all i can
about woman taking in all she can
and for as long as i breathe ill save a seat in my memory
for that woman with the tattooed hands

these headphones keep me from rememberin rememberin
also guilty of letting me not forget also guilty
what type of harvest will september bring beckoning
everyone to put him to that test somebody please kill me
ive got a sickness it feels like love
its not contagious take off the gloves
drop your defenses apply a coat of perfect
ill form the sentences you try to interpret
itd all be so simple if i was rich but im not
but im not so i compensate with thought i got a lot
i got a lot of nothin that you need to know ay yo
you would think he wasnt aware of the glow whered you go
swimmin in a bottle of imposters
losin my ground in the name of takin it farther
we can thumb wrestle or we can make a daughter
i thought it was supposed to get easier when you worked harder
stole the city i still feel helpless
baited the hook and caught me a selfish
im gonna gut it clean it cook it feed it to a she
and see if i can get her to need me

and now im standin at the bottom of the steps
and if i tilt my head a little i can look up her dress
and im willin to bet that shed move if she knew
so imma tap her on the shoulder imma give her a clue

all it takes is a stroll down the street
a pro and he greets a new soul hed like to meet
showed you the beating of the artery he keeps on the end of his sleeve
as he pretends he can breathe
lend me a piece of your superiority
i feel alone on this mission im wishin there was more of me
a pair of me apparently im a parasite caught inside a paradox
a paradise a parody the hair police have got what you need
for you to get over me and move on with godspeed
id let it all go and break eggs for a livin
if i wasnt so conditioned to just take what im given
get it got it catch it caught it and lost it
yet i cant stop it its embedded in my optics
plus the frustration is a product of the gossip
if you cant walk away can you at least change the topic
overextended the amount of time allotted
broke the engine i dont know cracked the block
now im standin at this gravel roadside festival
and i aint tryin to move cause this view is incredible

standin at the bottom of the steps
and if i tilt my head a little i can look up her dress
and im willin to bet that shed move if she knew
so imma tap her on the shoulder imma give her a clue

fall in love with all of she fall in love with all of she
hasnt stopped callin me hasnt stopped callin me
message in a bottle theres a message in a bottle
and i stepped inside a pothole i stepped inside a pothole
somehow forgot my name somehow forgot my name
blew out the flame she blew out the flame
a means to an end a means to an end
cant even be friends its a song about a friend
shes still in my dreams she steals all my dreams
angel spread your wings angel spread your wings
tryin to comprehend im still tryin to comprehend
cant even be friends its a song about a friend

all togethercrowd whooo
smile while you do that shit you know what im saying
cause like some of yall if you aint smilin youre ugly i swear to god
alright  some mean mugs
alright on the count of three one two

i realize that we aint the same
but you might appreciate it if i try to explain
while im sitting in the middle of a lake
gotta find a fish to come and nibble on the bait
ima set the stage for the challenge
ima meditate just for practice
ima concentrate on my balance
imma contemplate on this canvas
im a bandit running with a stolen moment
the careful arrow narrow focus
gotta roll with both eyes open
quality of life feels like im floating
trying to make this minute stretch
cause whats in my face is so picturesque
i mean it even made me quit the cigarettes
i mean shit i guess i got a fish to catch

just like an answered calling
when i drop this line in the water
keep fishing man with a vision
look brother i saw the future
look past ill draw it for you
strong words of an old soul
dont rock my boat i told them
reel em in throw em back slow

everything looks clear in hindsight
if you can adjust to the twilight
trying to live enough life to last a lifetime
roll with the ride like im supposed to survive
how you know that you alive
if you aint fighting for a mouthful of future
this aint business as usual check the tackle
box full of beautiful look like shrapnel
break the cycle and the old mistakes
but the boat obeys the waves
and then the little fish spoke as it broke away
it said know limits but know with a k
yesterdays catch will cook tomorrow
right now i gotta do what i gotta
took a time out from the human drama
put my line in the water now who wanna holler

just like an answered calling
when i drop this line in the water
keep fishing man with a vision
look brother i saw the future
look past ill draw it for you
strong words of an old soul
dont rock my boat i told them
reel em in throw em back slow
just like an answered calling
when i drop this line in the water
keep fishing man with a vision
look brother i saw the future
look past ill draw it for you
strong words of an old soul
dont rock my boat i told them
reel em in throw em back slow

i used to force your heartrate to run a race
and now its safe to say its be running out of patience
frustration you want some separation

i had a rough day but thats life it happens
woke up on a dark side of my mattress
i guess i forgot to set my clock
overslept almost lost the job
then to top it off im kinda hungry
but cant eat till i find my money
its in my wallet but my wallet aint in my pocket
cant remember the last time i saw it
and they dont want me in a bad mood
afraid that itll spread and everyone will catch an attitude
they got em all singing the same tune
thinking i should go and start a fire in the break room
coworkers make me sick
and the manager really aint shit
but i cant quit so im hiding in the basement
holding onto to my face like fuck this place

every day cant be the best day
do what you can right now dont hesitate
thats why we try to make love and get paid
take the bad with the good now lets play

hell naw i aint going to school
the teachers a jerk he must think im a fool
and all the kids mess with each other always all day
class warfare up and down the hallways
and if you aint popular
nobody talks to ya unless they mocking ya
not even bus driver or the hall monitor
i might as well climb inside my locker huh
its a bad day bad week and a bad month
dont nobody want to trade with my bag lunch
someday imma be so cool
but for now i got cheap shoes so i keep losing
girls give no love to a poor man
its a prison the clock is warden
man it wont get no better when i get home
so i listen to the voice in my headphones

every day cant be the best day
do what you can right now dont hesitate
thats why we try to make love and get paid
take the bad with the good now lets play

cant dance with an upset stomach
the overdraft notices just kept coming
somebody broke into the porch and stole a chair
top of your head stopped growing hair
broken glass computer crashed
the car wont start and the tires went flat
dog got loose brought back a dead cat
daughter found it and had a panic attack
plus you aint had sex in how long
afraid to admit that the fires all gone
the better half is talking about separate
you wish you could take it back to yesterday
you not alone its hard as hell
but dont waste no time feeling sorry for self
well be right here with you through your war
cause youre the one that we make this music for
now turn it up

every day cant be the best day
do what you can right now dont hesitate
thats why we try to make love and get paid
take the bad with the good now lets play

she goes by the nickname peyote her real name is iris
appearance doesnt matter so im not gonna describe it
she was a dancer down at edit this portion
i cant name the spot they dont merit the promotion
but i been there look like any strip club
everybody slicked up trying to get they dick sucked
smoke and mirrors you know fake magic tricks
like these people didnt come here just for ass and tits
but this one in particular was popular with midlife ballers
and white collar out of towners
plus it attracted athletic individuals that came here to play against
the twins and the timber wolves
safe to say she made the rent good
twenty years of age a spot up in kentwood
she had the car the dog and the kitchen sink
she had a drugfree body didnt even drink
she had a sister who wouldnt stop giving her shit
for dropping out of art school to be a stripper
iris was sick and tired of the questions
but big sis didnt understand the perspective
she knows her little sister isnt a slut
but she objectifies herself and contributes to the gluttony
now heres iris stealin from the devil to buy some time
to make life something special

where did you go when did you fall
that little one you all grown up
oh how theyve grown those days are done
under the gun now you are dealt
where did you go when did you fall
that little one you all grown up
oh how theyve grown those days are done
look at us who you to judge

her oldest sisters name was jocelyn
awfully slim on a diet of bottled water and oxygen
she lives on higher water by the target
and she dates a photographer thats how she started modeling
she aint no supermodel this is minneap for that youd have to move to chicago
or maybe la or ny
now she does what she does here and she gets by
and her boyfriend gets a little currency
taking photos for advertising agencies
now hes gonna steal from the devil
stick it to the man revolutionary rebel
one afternoon after work he went to the strip club
just to loosen up that shirt
he and a couple job associates are gonna sink them drinks
like they about to be extinct
never met his girlfriends little sister
but she recognized him from cell phone pictures
any other circumstances shed have hollered
but topless in heels is a little bit awkward
eventually his friends leave
and when he gets up she grabs him by the coat sleeve
too drunk to catch what she says
but he did offer her three hundred on some head like

when you do wrong it makes me want to do right
it also cancels out the guilt that makes the load feel light
it also gives some leverage to the morally impaired
so make mistakes for us to hold over your hair

you better dead those tears
uh they say the end is near
and i doubt that they were talking about this can of beer
get on the purple motorcycle and ride
were still trying to party like its one thousand nine hundred and ninetynine times out of ten
were all looking at our fate like a date and we hoping that she brought her friend
lean on the same crutches
like a new game plan aint nothing to fuck with
pass the judgement pon the left hand side
splash in the flood like youll never get dry
run like the blood from a dead mans pride
everybody bets with they life
and lately i feel like the meal got tasty
trying to look at what the cooks putting in the gravy
i know im not crazy
i just got so much soul the devil hates me

sing a song we will recite
worked so long to build your life
but it could feel so wrong to feel alright
when the world might not live through the night
sing a song we will recite
worked so long to build your life
but it could feel so wrong to feel alright
when the world might not live through the night

were supposed to live in fear
otherwise mama might see you in some prison gear
gotta be a model civilian
and get your name printed on a bottle full of pills and
spill your guts into a dixie cup
give no fucks kiss no butts
so edgy such a rebel
low levy another level
but everybody want the same thing we all want the same things
we all wanna chase dreams
celebrate trying to maintain
with a little more time to appreciate this painting
now pretend youre not alone
and put your hands up in the air like a drone
yeah now hold em over your head
like your home got invaded by the feds

sing a song we will recite
worked so long to build your life
but it could feel so wrong to feel alright
when the world might not live through the night
sing a song we will recite
worked so long to build your life
but it could feel so wrong to feel alright
when the world might not live through the night

apocalyptic little predictable
opportunity hypocritical
i got a wristband give me access
we gonna party til they bomb minneapolis
and well admit that its not that complex
just a big popularity contest
working with the same tools ever since grade school
now say a prayer for the pimp and pump the keg dude
and if you try you could get so high
convinced you could kiss the sky
and that seem better than trying to be a better friend
hold your breath in and then dive in the decadence
im lucky im alive just to represent
and document my life in the present tense
so ima keep talking shit
until mama nature kicks us off the tit

sing a song we will recite
worked so long to build your life
but it could feel so wrong to feel alright
when the world might not live through the night
sing a song we will recite
worked so long to build your life
but it could feel so wrong to feel alright
when the world might not live through the night

she got a condition of the heart  a heart condition
so as a kid she had to adapt to smarter livin
not much room to rebel because of health
no drugs no booze just kiss and tell
well known on the scene jail bait queen
had the first baby barely eighteen
father of the child was after one thing
when the daughter came the dad was unseen
it dont matter he aint got a job
so she had to go to work and leave the baby with her mom
second shift till the neck is stiff
but she worked to build her own nest to live
soon after that babys dad slash lazy bum with no cash
he want to come over and crash
he want to play his part
so she let him move into that garden level apartment
she knew better she did it anyways
explain better when you trynna see some better days
the suns up catch those rays
butterflies now whos got chase

but she still dreams after she woke
tight hold on that hope
sometimes it could seem so cold do what you gotta do to cope
but she still dreams after she woke
tight hold on that hope
sometimes it could seem so cold do what you gotta do to cope

two years later two months pregnant
same daddy same broke ass situation
this time the doc said her heart might break
praise god that the job got her health benefits straight
she believes in the right to choice
but she loves baby girl and she wants a boy
makes more now a days on the day shift
balanced that with night classes take some
time and space and make it all fit
the apartment they now live in is overcrowded
raised her voice and made her point
told that boy go get employed
he put on his best shirt
said he wasnt comin back till he gets work
she knew what that part meant
so she swept every piece out that apartment
peace out keep out take the scenic route
rather only have to feed three mouths
she adapts to everything now
and nobody asks what she dreams about

a little girl was her first reason to breathe
and a little man was the first man she believed in
she gotta live right and do right by self
she do for self she dont want your help
afraid of bein alone but fear aint enough to knock her off of that stone
gonna make that home her home with or without a man that she could call her own
big boss at work is anxious continues to hand her the wrong advances
she passes the test she knew the answers
quit the job to go take her chance with life
this is life we all strain
while we pray for dollars and we work for change
its all the same we all struggle
sometimes you gotta say fuck you
when you smile and she doesnt return it
give her room man dont disturb it
if it makes it hurt less to curse and fight
go ahead and hate the world girl you earned the right

leave your shoes up by the furnace cause we just put new carpets in
she asked me bout my day then sat me down
told me we should have some fun there aint nobody around

thats alright this shit crazy what the fuck she had me take
if this kill me imma come back haunt her every single day
as i wait sittin somewhere that i never seen

power and imagination got all my surroundings changin
found a place to drown my brain it something like its outer space
but nothin like the pictures from the astronauts
they showed me back at school
when they told me drugs were bad oh man oh man they had me fooled

i dont know what happened to me
but as soon as it hit me i was fuckin free

time and time a brother asks why
the rhyme is not laced with a gangsta touch
i said simply because i dont live that way
still kickin them rhymes rugged and rough
but that wont sell
cause you gotta keep it real
so that we can feel
where youre coming from
because these streets is ill so if you aint
killing niggas in rhymes
your whole sounds just bubble gum
i said i wont contribute to genocide
id rather try to cultivate the inner side
and try to evolve the frustrated ghetto mind
the devil and his army never been a friend of mine
but niggas dont wanna hear that shit said the brother
who was obviously totally misled and yelled out
murder murder kill murder instilled in the influential thoughts
of our kids heads

shallow days you never wanna
let a brother be a brother
fully inner to the outer
caught up in all them hollow nights
cant escape cause everywhere that i look
people front and it just aint right
repeat

i said dont you know the powers that be
are using people as pawns devouring we
until they see us all gone and outta the scene
and as i passed the chronic he said look at where i be
i tried to get a job for real
but all the homies hit liqs and rob and steal
and keep fat pockets caught in a rut to catch ground
this ways in plus who could you trust
i said im all about protecting mine
but neglected minds be gettin left behind
why dont you change your environment
he said this is all i know
plus my fams all that i got i cant go
i said you gotta make it for the fams
damn he said i didnt make the ghetto
the ghetto made the man
i said youre more than just that
shook his hand said damn you gotta find a way
to break the devils master plan peace

shallow days you never wanna
let a brother be a brother
fully inner to the outer
caught up in all them hollow nights
cant escape cause everywhere that i look
people front and it just aint right
repeat

the word peace is just an expression
used to say bye when its time to jet
and them red black and green medallions
was all just part of the trend i guess
hardly ever them around brothers necks no more
instead of that gold gats
inspiring gangstas and macks
who at the young age of four
be seeing more drama than war veterans
instead of learning gods laws
and hiphop is a voice that we enlisted
to express how we be feeling about this and that
but music does reflect life
and kids look up to what youre portraying
and mimic what you act like
its time for a new day
an era in rap conscious styles
makin them aware of the happenings
but their ears seem more steered towards
selfannihilation so then they might laugh
and write this off like im out here just
blowing wind maybe label us soft or unreal
something they just cant feel while they yell
murder murder murder kill kill kill

i just keep movin on moving on 
i just keep movin on moving on 

shallow days  hollow nights
repeat

fee fi fo fum i smell the blood of a rapper thats wack
as a matter of fact i smack a back of the style jackets are now
mellow minced defeatin the mental
and become gentle as ben but then they stibble and dribble
and bend like a pencil
the only utensil i got is brain power
and you know its essential i rock i rain showers
sleet snow and raise hella eyebrows with my styles
youre wondering how wild
when what where made ladies so horny
they cant even be showin they butt bare
look up there beside the birds the planets the hawk
the rappers who talk the mo shit
im makin em walk the plank they stank im takin they rank
they tossed tiddlewinks im playin em like that game
im gunnin and rackin and packin em up
and im runnin this here rap thang
main you wanna go to war ill take you
i physically break you when i break through
im makin you fake crew you made a mistake fool
i hate you mcs ill grate you like cheese
i may choose to squeeze my pencil
and write out a couple of rhymes
whooooaaaa whooa my goodness
are we slaughterin is this just slaughter mc night
or somethin man what is this
is this all the aggression you ever had
how many mcs must get ripped before by says dont flip with the gift
you know thats what im talkin bout
how many mcs must get dismissed
before somebody says dont trip with the gift
laughter
you know its all good
kp and sloganmasters in the house the cheezit terrorist
and we chillin at nine hundred and three we got thirteen minutes left
and then we got brenda short and her records

chorus gift of gab
we keep embellishin upon a new uncharted path
expressin what we see and how we comprehend the math
so theres enough for everyone we gotta make it last
we gotta make it last

as i embark on lifes journey from the point where im at
peace to everyone i know or who i go way back wit
every pimp every mack every gangsta to jack
every hustler feedin babies anybody problack
every sister raisin kids without the help of a dad
wantin for they children all the things that they never had
all the brothers handlin business even though shits hard
wakin up at five am holdin down three jobs
all my rasta brethern gettin insight from trees
to my brothers up in college gettin phds
or any other degree even if you just read
for mental health see youre concious that your mind is free
all my people locked down for your past mistakes
mentally and spiritually dwellin past the gates
you could change your ways elevate today
to all recovered alcoholics chillin up in aa
every blackowned business keep doin for self
helpin out the community and spreadin the wealth
understand that help aint gonna come from nowhere else
revolutionaries makin the unjust get dealth wit
head on black people got to meet the task
educate keep learnin gotta question ask
and let your light keep shinin and remember the past
by any means necessary well be free at last
chorus

as i embark on lifes journey from the point where im at
peace to everybody strivin to live right and exact
even though anxieties try to pull you down
see your troubles as a blessin and youre homeward bound
everybody gotta struggle thats the way of the world
cant develop biceps if you dont do curls
cant achieve a a garden if you never water your crops
if you never paid your dues then you dont get props
couldnt eat a proper meal without cookin it first
cant receive a paycheck if you dont do work
if it wasnt for the rain then the trees wont grow
when the spring came around what a sight to bestow
when you face adversities dark clouds wont last
if you never study how do you expect to pass
the grasshoppers laid around while the ants did chores
when the winter came around he was left outdoors
see the cycle keeps moving like a big machine
evolution of the mind soul body and being
godll never put upon you more than you can take
sometimes you even gotta learn from other peoples mistakes
so head on black people got to meet the task
educate keep learnin gotta question ask
and let your light keep shinin and remember the past
by any means necessary well be free at last
chorus

amazing phase your days your hazy ways my blazing arrow
the rays that range from asia way to rio de janeiro
a craze you crave but work todays the day that in a major way
ill make you say oh look he saved the day and also paved the way hooray
rocking my crew like razor blades today and days away from now okay okay
im like a laser ray keeping the stage ablaze
and dangerous ways rapping the phrase that pays
all things just aint a phase but ageless ways a cagey great displays
yo hey this aint a game so stays awake
cause if you came to play youll all behave insane
after we change the game it wont remain the same
ill fade away so make your disc and play this tape in your camaro
amazing phase your days your hazy ways my blazing arrow
the verbal dart i throw a murder all my foe and kill em
but learning all and so im growing while im learning with em
inferno ill explode returning out the globe about to blow
now get up out your seat head on out the zones that i patrol
rock and roll might tear you out the soul like blunts and alcohol
i knock your whole toboggan for a loop and now the doubt will flow
im not the pro you wanna knock cause on the real i got the glow
cosmic flows as i suppose thats how its supposed to be
and got to go howd ya know intuition
i was on the old safe surface
figure out your purpose thats impossible
but logic will disturb the thought or focus what its not is all about
the grow about the kind of onus only god can know
i rock it for the chocolate for the awkward for the thoughtless
in your home or at your office
im your early morning coffee sip who got the ball
we roll with navajos with double barrels
amazing phase your days your hazy ways my blazing arrow

yeah yeah uhh uhhuh
brand nubian yeah yeah check it
introchorus
you dont have to drive a fancy car
just for you to be a shinin star
no matter who you are no matter who you are

uhh now it started it off for me in apartment sixc
project style ate government cheese for a while
pop duke wasnt there cos he had to do a bid
so momma love stuck with these bad ass kids
she used to say keep your head up always think positive
and never be ashamed of who you are or where you live
teenage years i had to struggle doing that
shorty say dont talk to him girlfriend look where he live at
crib probably crawlin with roaches and rats
plus cats be in his hallways with the drugs and the gats
i used to try and honeys used to walk on by
now im damn near twenty and still aint got no ride
caught a record deal now them same old chicks that used to walk on by
go out their way to say hi
but they gets none
thats why im with the same girl from the same projects that i come from
because
chorus xtwo

well this is that time that youve waited for
three linked from what was said to be extinct
you say take my weedsmellin ass home im grown
more thirst than if i swallowed sand bags
not fiending enough to go out and grab bags from women
i swear if we dont hear this on the air

on the late night blunted in the basement with sadat

where some brothers might go for broke
utilizin the effects of the smoke

i pull cash to smash make the blunt last

in a flash put that ass in the grass
flag is halfmast somebody mustve passed
were makin your ass drip into the stands
fold my cash at last my task to teach the class
and receive somethin more than brass and some glass
make a brother work hard long and fast

dreadlock i set to rock for my block
clock wax like crack samplin from old stacks
thats where the souls at in this whole rap universe
we kick the funky tunes with a verse
sun moon and star some boom for jamar
to get me in the flow now im read to go
set to show everybody in the party that were nice
without sippin on bacardi and ice

this style flash jamarll be the shinin star
no matter who you are no matter who you are
ill rape the tape drive along the interstate
with weight wipe the slate and mob the gate
by fate ill avoid the court date no legal aid
everythin is paid why cause a tyraid
if the money aint made talkin millions
but spendin pennies and gettin cheap shoes from kennys

now lets take time out to say peace to the gods peace
bust how i release cause this beat is hard
we be the squad fard taught to rule
take a thought to the top now i drop the jewel

i push the cadillac deville and still be real
i drive a garbage truck and not give a 
i need to earn a buck fo the year
im through with buyin wild gear
just somethin i can wear somethin fly when i appear

well now were here to take the gold and the cash for the bill fold
i told their ass to chill and theyre still cold
frozen cause theyre not amongst the chosen one
sun shines like a beacon similar to how im speakin

as i receive the mic for the last time i clear up your past crime
all felonies can go as long as you know
brand nubian will stand without the use of a band
we always work with a plan

peace to the gods peace to the earths
peace to the positive people of the universe
brand nubian came to work it like this
ya see each and every day
each and every waay
were gonna show and prove
teach you the righteous way
peace to allah and justice and justice justice
peace to allah and juuhhhhstice
repeat these two lines throught song

the knowledge is the foundation
the wisdom is the waay
the understanding shows you
that you are on your way

the culture is igod
the power is the truth
equality only shows you
that you have planted your roots

god came to teach us
of the righteous way
how to build and be born
on this glorious day

the knowledge of the cipher
is to enlighten you
true that true that true that you know
that god is right inside you

it aint hard to tell i excel then prevail
the mic is contacted i attract clientele
my mic check is life or death breathin a snipers breath
i exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
deep like the shining sparkle like a diamond
sneak a uzi on the island in my army jacket linin
hit the earth like a cometinvasion
nas is like the afrocentric asian halfman halfamazin
cause in my physical i can express through song
delete stress like motrin then extend strong
i drink moët with medusa give her shotguns in hell
from the spliff that i lift and inhale it aint hard to tell

the buddha monks in your trunk turn the bass up
not stories by aesop
place your loot up parties i shoot up
nas i analyze drop a jewel inhale from the l
school a fool well you feel it like braille
it aint hard to tell i kick a skill like shaquille holds a pill
vocabulary spills im ill plus matic
i freak beats slam it like iron sheik
jam like a tec with correct techniques
so analyze me surprise me but cant magmatize me
scannin while youre plannin ways to sabotage me
i leave em froze like heroin in your nose
nas will rock well it aint hard to tell

this rhythmatic explosion
is what your frame of mind has chosen
ill leave your brain stimulated niggas is frozen
speak with criminal slang begin like a violin
end like leviathan its deep well let me try again
wisdom be leakin out my grapefruit troop
i dominate break loops givin mics menestrual cycles
streets disciple i rock beats thats mega trifle
and groove even smoother than moves by villanova
youre still a soldier im like sly stone in cobra
packin like a rasta in the weed spot
vocals will squeeze glocks
mcs eavesdrop though they need not to sneak
my poetrys deep i never fell
nas raps should be locked in a cell it aint hard to tell

if heaven was a mile away
would i pack up my bags and leave this world behind
if heaven was a mile away
or save it all for you
if heaven was a mile away
would i fill the tank up put gas
and be out the front door in a flash
before reconsidering this hell with you
it aint you its the thing you do do
its tearing my heart in two
i wouldve fell with you to hell with you

if heaven was a mile away and you could ride by the gates
would you try to run inside when it opens
would you try to die today
would you pray louder finally believe in his power
even if you couldnt see him but you could feel him
would you still doubt him
how would you start actin
would you try to put the keys down thinkin every drug sale that you make in the streets he can see now
would a fiend even want to get high would he stop smokin
if he knew on his own two feet he could just stroll in
to get away and escape from the craziness
and i bet you theres a heaven for a atheist
its hard takin this racist planet
where they take a younger brother in a handcuff
even if he innocent nigga get on the car
put your motherfuckin hands up
thinkin ima lose it my moms in chemo
three times a week yo keep tryin but people its hard
and god your young soldiers not so bold but needs you
this worlds my home but world i will leave you

if heaven was a mile away
would i pack up my bags and leave this world behind
if heaven was a mile away
or save it all for you
if heaven was a mile away
would i fill the tank up put gas
and be out the front door in a flash
before reconsidering this hell with you
it aint you its the thing you do do
its tearing my heart in two
i wouldve fell with you to hell with you

nigga what you think ima stop building
ima stop feelin like im amistads greatgreatgrandchildren
how im not gonna want to make millions
since the quarter water days in the hallways
makin fake gold caps
with the reeses pieces wrapper in my mouth all day
but then my style has quite a while
that same type as ill and al skratch
game time took em cats never looked back
cristal blowin dub sacks
thats when it all just hit me you see the broads and bentleys
is nothin unless my niggas spend it all with me
id give it all away quickly
just to hear them all about some new kicks free
of any autographs and not to be recognized forgive me
its becomin unbearable makin hits is easy
put a famous bitch on a hook there you go with a platinum cd
i know you heard the noise preachers touchin on alter boys
sodomizin not realizin god is watchin before the lord
how could they do the devils work
a man give another man head in church
hell it hurts just to fathom the thought wishin that i fled the earth

if heaven was a mile away
would i pack up my bags and leave this world behind
if heaven was a mile away
or save it all for you
if heaven was a mile away
would i fill the tank up put gas
and be out the front door in a flash
before reconsidering this hell with you
it aint you its the thing you do do
its tearing my heart in two
i wouldve fell with you to hell with you

you trapped in your own hell
every day i wake up im blessed
every day you wake up and breathe another breath you blessed
to all them niggas runnin around

reminiscent of my first time up in a chick
you was innocent but now you rentadick wear the tightest shit
chanel looking real airbrushed nails

to see a prophecy your ebony tone is locking me
the way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me
wishin i could be the one man but you juggle
way too many willies all in one hand
you wanna run up in clubs getting rubbed on
niggas pull your hair shake your fat rear
get your fuck on  following week you back there
but what you stuck on weed clowns and cars
puffing with some lil nigga husband not knowing shes out
could you believe eve mother earth of the seas

igloos of ice tricking on you you never listen
to this nigga spending franklins on tennis anklets

say men are all the same what we need to do is break this chain
you got a job parttime and schools your night thing
with dreams to settle down it aint far from now
you getting interviewed but your boss is into getting screwed
typical day that the black girl sees
coming home wanting more from a college degree

diamonds all shining looking all fine
pretty little face get a little high
young girl struggling trying to survive trying to survive
mother of the earth she made you and i
just tired of playing the same ol games
messing with my mind emotional thangs messing with my mind
and there goes a black girl lost

where are you focused on legit niggas and where the coke is
nice and thug life niggas yo you seem hopeless
your value  too much to be measured i wonder how you
could ever be played your pussy worth gold amounting to
more than the world but not knowing nothing about you
you leaving the crib taking all your kids out to
drop them off letting some nigga knock you off
so hot and soft thats the same thing that got you lost you should be ashamed
growing up seeing it it should remind you you bein lied to
everything that move be inside you
sacred as you are left with these wannabes to guide you
i watched you hard to knock you i tried not to
they spot you out dancing topless in your drawers
damn look there goes a black girl lost

you should be ashamed of yourself
the way you carry yourself
the way you hang out all night long
doing silly things that is wrong
black girl lost

i guess you knew and blew a good thing baby

bye baby i guess you knew why i walked away
when we walked to the altar that was an awesome day

you screaming at the racist cops in miami was probably
the highlight of my life like ha yo look at my wife

divorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending
with you paying out the ass and im talking half
not some but half no serious half
half of your soul half of your heart you leaving behind
its either that or die i wanted peace of mind
and all i seen was selfish cowards
under their breath saying why did nas trust her
but look at yourself speak louder bruh
you live with your baby moms
and scared to make an honest woman out of her
and make her your bride fake pimps you aint even alive
at least i can say i tried plus enjoyed the ride

customized in london by guys who suitup kings

maxwell he gon sing invited lauryn hill and the gang
baltimore north cacky mississippi

im getting married

yo its like waking up from a bad dream
america just to figure out
you wasnt dreaming in the first place

if all i saw was gangsters coming up as a youngster
pussy and money the only language i clung ta
claim ta i mold myself up to become one
aint ya happy i chose rap im a monster
streets deceiving cant believe my achievements
cultural strata persona is that of a nonneeder
cause i dont need nada cept for prada beaver
for cold winters tattoos got my summer sleeveless
to my gs on the flee from the coppers
stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors
from the slums i come up a phoenix caked up
trying to take what im eating came up a dismissive kid
you lucky if you allowed to witness this
savvy mild wild hardly
a mans man who wouldve knew the beach houses and wild parties
jezebels and stella mccartneys
for years all that how can i not be dead
this old german said i was a thug with a knotty head
looked at my benz and called that a nazi sled
with a face like he wonder where i got my bread
probably all these stones he see from my shows overseas
from crime to rhyme my story is im from the home of the thieves

america americaaaaaa pay attention
wake up this is not what you think it is
america americaaaaaa pay attention
this is not what you think it is

blessed the lord is a g he gotta be
whos the god of suckers and snitches the economy
lipstick from marilyn monroe blew a death kiss to fidel castro
hed want me to spit this
only the strong survive nas bear witness
the hypocrisy is all i can see
white cop acquitted for murder black cop cop a plea
that type of shit make me stop and think
we in chronic need of a second look of the law books
and the whole race dichotomy
too many rappers athletes and actors
but not enough niggas in nasa
who give you the latest dances trends and fashion
but when it comes to residuals they look past us
woven into the fabric they cant stand us
even in white tees blue jeans and red bandanas

america americaaaaaa pay attention
wake up this is not what you think it is
america americaaaaaa pay attention
this is not what you think it is

assassinations diplomatic relations
killed indigenous people built a new nation
involuntary labor took a knife split a woman naval
took her premature baby let her man see you rape her
if i could travel to the one thousand seven hundreds
id push a wheelbarrow full of dynamite through your covenant
love to sit on the senate and tell the whole government
yall dont treat women fair she read about herself in the bible
believing she the reason sin is here
you played her with an apron like bring me my dinner dear
she the nigga here aint we in the free world
death penalty in texas kill young boys and girls
barbarity im in the doubler casually
bugging how i made it out the hood dazzle me
how far are we really from third world savagery
when the empire fall imagine how crazy thatll be

america americaaaaaa americaaaaaa
america americaaaaaa
this is not what you think it is
america americaaaaaa
this is not what you think it is
america

some are just more into it than others

uhh uhh where am i going
where am i
yo its ill

yo my wifes tired of fucking me
life tries ducking me
luckily i find em just at the right time
mac in my right arm
tequila bottle in my left arm like christión
watching my life go
cant do myself in
wolves in the night yo hells men
two revolvers i can let twelve spin
hop in my benz push it to the limit
bucksixty who wit me
my cris two ls twisted blunts and inner conscience
telling me that i aint shit
no matter how much cash i sit with
still gotta ask the lord for forgiveness
my precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
to replenish my adolescent brain
blessed be her name before her birth i was insane
so i drive to cool the pressure down delay the pain
i ate from these poisonous fucked up streets
tasted larceny it was sweet i starved for more to eat
though i took that was to live hope god will forgive
as odd as it is the more i gain the harder it is
to maintain bitches playin games
niggas snitchin
i aint saying names
but yall niggas better watch how yall slang
lost so many close niggas
drunk almost crashed
im going too fast
highway patrol will just flash
lights in my rearview
if they stop me i hope they lock me
instead they speed ahead
yo nigga watch me

im drunk by myself gun under my seat
i dont want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
im a ride to the end of the road if i have to
praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
steering wheel in my hand
trying to hold it steady
anything in my way is dead
cause thats the way i feel i am already
when im drunk by myself alone in the zone
drunk by myself

heard niggas hate me but i hated too once
been in the shoes of a wolf in the night when he hunts
for every shell niggas bust we bust at ourselves
cant tell them niggas nothing though
bullets wake em up well
take them to hell
stick up niggas once ran up on me
my decadent lifestyle attracted sharks on me
i aint your mark homey
its hard to look straight
my foot on the brake
spilling my bottle not even shook of the jakes
could hardly look both ways
put out the haze blurry vision
think about the time in my life before i was in television
hella women
jealous niggas up in my vision
since we all hood niggas expect kilos
for what they not seeing is police expect rico
only if i could take care of everybody intoxicated
windows up blasting ac going wherever instinct takes me
i hate it when im like this
the bottles my accomplice

im drunk by myself gun under my seat
i dont want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
im a ride to the end of the road if i have to
praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
steering wheel in my hand
trying to hold it steady
anything in my way is dead
cause thats the way i feel i am already
when im drunk by myself alone in the zone
drunk by myself

the reason that i want to be alone
tired of all the things that went wrong
that would have went right if i would have did it on my own
take another swig
the more i drink the more i think bad thoughts
fake friends who hung around who wanna bring you down
not knowing who to trust rumors about niggas coming through
supposedly to shoot at us not knowing what was true
or what to believe thats why im on the low lately
choosing a henny bottle over a friend driving again
to keep my mind off that weak shit
theres love through it all
things to live for
i swerve almost crash into a wall
think about the good
find myself laughing
turn the cell off no way to be reached
know im near my crib
tryna see my way through the streets
reminded of the positive i take my drunk ass home
start feeling out of it cant wait to get out of this whip
bring my ass to the crib
im tired

im drunk by myself gun under my seat
i dont want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
im a ride to the end of the road if i have to
praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
steering wheel in my hand
trying to hold it steady
anything in my way is dead
cause thats the way i feel i am already
when im drunk by myself alone in the zone
drunk by myself

word up word up

i seen some cold nights and bloody days
they grab me and bullets spray
they use me wrong so i sing this song til this day
my body is cold steel for real
i was made to kill thats why they keep me concealed
under car seats they sneak me in clubs
been in the hands of mad thugs
they feed me when they load me with mad slugs
seventeen precisely one in my head
they call me desert eagle semiauto with lead
im seven inches four pounds been through so many towns
ohio to little rock to canarsie living harshly
beat up and battered they pull me out
i watch as niggas scattered making me kill
but what i feel it never mattered
when im empty im quiet finding myself fiending to be fired
a broken safety niggas place me in shelves
under beds so i beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
keeping me full up with hollow heads

how you like me now i go blaow
its that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
i might have took your first child
scarred your life or crippled your style
i gave you power i made you buckwild
how you like me now i go blaow
its that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
i might have took your first child
scarred your life or crippled your style
i gave you power i made you buckwild

always im in some shit
my abdomen is the clip the barrel is my dick uncircumcised
pull my skin back and cock me
i bust off when they unlock me
results of what happens to niggas shock me
i see niggas bleeding running from me in fear stunningly tears
fall down the eyes of these socalled tough guys for years
ive been used in robberies giving niggas heart to follow me
placing peoples in graves funerals made cause i was sprayed
i was laid in a shelf with a grenade
met a wreckedup tec with numbers on his chest that say
fivetwoohninethreeeightfive and zero
had a serial defaced hoping one day police would place
where he came from a name or some sort of person to claim him
tired of murdering made him wanna be a plain gun
but yo i had some other plans like the next time the beef is on
i make myself jam right in my owners hand

how you like me now i go blaow
its that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
i might have took your first child
scarred your life or crippled your style
i gave you power i made you buckwild
how you like me now i go blaow
its that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
i might have took your first child
scarred your life or crippled your style
i gave you power i made you buckwild

yo weeks went by and im surprised
still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
besides me its bullets two vests and then a nine
theres a grenade in a box and that tec that kept crying
cause he aint been cleaned in a year hes rusty its clear
hes bout to fall to pieces cause of his murder career
yo i can hear somebody coming in open the shelf
his eyes bubbling he said it was on
i felt his palm troubled him shaking
somebody stomped him out his dome was aching
he placed me on his waist the moment ive been waiting
my creation was for blacks to kill blacks
its gats like me that accidentally go off making niggas memories
but this time its done intentionally
he walked me outside saw this cat
cocked me back said remember me
he pulled the trigger but i held on it felt wrong
knowing niggas is waiting in hell for him
he squeezed harder i didnt budge sick of the blood
sick of the thugs sick of wrath of the next mans grudge
what the other kid did was pull out no doubt
a newer me in better shape before he lit out he lead the chase
my owner fell to the floor his wig split so fast
i didnt know he was hit its over with
heard mad niggas screaming niggas running cops is coming
now im happy until i felt somebody else grab me
damn

these are the onlychild blues
the onlychild blues
the onlychild who yo yo yo

back once again hello its yo favorite mellow schizo
the pavement on this yellow brick road fuckin up my mental
my mood just like the tempo
heartbeat that instrumental
i never lack potential every track is essential
every project is special abundant and fundamental
give a fuck about hundreds as long as its for my mental
with wisdom from what ive been through
knowledge that some cant get to
understanding that college is only out for a nickel
we could all be so simple tune it to the metronome
this how i used to feel back on the metro home
fresh outta class i knew these days they wouldnt last
just a stepping stone i gotta pass another story for the lap
but fuck it give him glory when he crash
he gettin revved up heads up and hes coming fast
he paved the lane before the cash
they tryna swerve me out of that
but i dont just got speed nigga i handle my ass
pedal to the gas life is but a getaway dash
my mama stash guarded by my pen and pad
im drawin weapons with the raps
you shoot i shoot backno questions asked
raise your hands for the realest cat alive
cat alive cat alive cat alive cat alive

thats that boy right therethats joey bad
the onlychild blues joey for the money manyo joey man
the onlychild who yo yo joey

and i remember sittin in my room all alone
staring at my ceiling fan getting in my zone
mama was never home
woke up one morning papa was gone
young and lost so i ease my mind to popular songs
and of course i sold my mind to music
writing everything i thought
started openin my mind then i send it abroad
they dont know what my ascending has caused
my third eye been blinking since
irv gotti been inking murderous thoughts
at least thats how irv gotta be thinking
if im takin a loss and im better next week
and im never weaker
never sinking on the fucking deep end
any shit i missed i prolly peeped it

like you know its fast living
these are the onlychild blues its not necessarily living
the onlychild who
you can also speak on the facts that hey youre a teenager
the onlychild blues
how me and you we go back and forth with it all the time
like you know what the onlychild blues
these are the onlychild who
the onlychild blues

yo onlychild blues ocb ocb
jovaughn clean your room ocd ocd
i used to wanna be like odb odb
now im a rap star omg omg
only childblues ocb ocb
yo jovaughn clean your room ocd ocd
i used to wanna be like odb odb
now im a rap star omg omg what

everything is perception
your perception of yourself or who you are is not what other people think that you are
so like for instance you might say im cool i dont wear jewelry i dont this i dont that
you dont have to to to

after that day my nigga
i remember when he came back to school three weeks after
gave that nigga a bible
and i was like yo wherever you go take this shit with you
you feel me and you gon be good
like i cant cause you my friend and i cant protect niggas
like all i can tell niggas is sit n pray and thats it
but niggas be taking their life for granted like
you know being on some wild cowboy shit you cant
you got beef with some nigga like dont be in their vicinity my nigga
i feel it
soul music

sometimes i just sit and pray
sometimes i just sit and pray
said i dont know why do i live my life this way
why do i live my life this way
yo said the apex rhymes on the empires eyes
can testify im the best of fly
live your life and im gon live mine

tell me what the fuck an angel does
were seeing kids who aint aged enough
getting high off angel dust
from ny to los angeles
there aint no love
in the heart of the city
looking where they car be at
and they party at
cardiac arrest can feel risky
real pissy i chase cheese and real pussy yeah
cats used to yawn on his rap now look at em
shit aint been the same since them niggas started booking em
pull up with your pen up looking sharper than a bulletin
with pin stripes and hollow tip bullets in it
hes something that youd invest in
catch him live on late night but he aint interestin
pop up and poop out something like intestine
no corrections cause the mic been checked in
the only time he be asking is when he sexing
my team like teenage mutants and xmen
fire spark when i step in
he the human torch
inhaling fumes of all sorts of course
steez taught me how to store it in my ball shorts
so when we stop by the d we never get caught
i say it again we face ls but never lost
either be a warlord for six fees short
each day in this living hell feel remorse
but he had a million dollar smile way before he flossed

sometimes i just sit and pray
sometimes i just sit and pray
said i dont know why do i live my life this way
why do i live my life this way
yo said the apex rhymes on the empires eyes
can testify im the best of fly
live your life and im gon live mine

yo im trying to oprah winwin with a l in my hand
remotely passed off like the generous man
and they wonder what it cost to put the pen in my hand
but dont understand they the only one who gets the benefit damn
sometimes i just sit and pray
they couldnt walk this way in my js
it wouldnt feel despair but disarray
like their souls disappear
son got hot flows got dropped like disarray
couldnt close my ghost souls eyes closed
covered with raybans i call it my eyes closed and i know
even through shades of black
i see brighter days looking back in fact
so i relax my mind see what these tracks can find
a gold mine that will make me rich in both dimes in mine
gotta make it all mine if you dont mind
cause sometimes

sometimes i just sit and pray
sometimes i just sit and pray
said i dont know why do i live my life this way
why do i live my life this way
yo said the apex rhymes on the empires eyes
can testify im the best of fly
live your life and im gon live mine

right on the block where they sit and play
lives the vicious ways where they spit and spray
vicious treys coming for the ice you kept in yesterday
its nothing but the history
protecting ya from being history
and then the next day your face is just a mystery
for niggas who really aint feeling me are all my fucking enemies
even the lightest hours requires heavy artillery
accelerate without the breaks of a break
and still im not eating up to now and theres a lot on my plate
all in a days work of god and his grace
you wanna eat then tell god and say grace
and avoid the heat getting the boil to surface
a soft nigga caught between these rocks and a hard place
because the mafia is on the look out for the scarface
but the illminded child is ill minded child
got a round of styles
killing niggas mental like a round of shells
very well rounded round it well til the highest number
praying that two thousand and fortyseven aint the highest number

sometimes i just sit and pray
sometimes i just sit and pray
said i dont know why do i live my life this way
why do i live my life this way
yo said the apex rhymes on the empires eyes
can testify im the best of fly
live your life and im gon live mine

get off my cheeks let me do my thing
interrupt the wave length
live and let live
and people talk smart got the balls to say
they apex and standing for this way
but got nothing to show or give
i aint judging

yeah you remember back in the days
when niggas used to rock waves and shit
when like yo i had the fucking three hundred and sixtys my nigga
like nobody in the hood was fucking with my shit
and thats real shit

uhh since ninetyfive momma been working ninefive
and i know the landlord fed up with our lies
so we pray to the gods the jahs and the allahs
to keep us safe and watch our lives
cause all we tryna do is do good
put on my hood when i walk through hoods
cause these niggas these days is loco
youll get it in ya vocals if you aint a local
yeah thats why im tryna go global
yeah thats why im tryna be a mogul
and im hopeful that me spittin it soulful
will have me in the daily postal flying coastal eatin tofu
like i told you i know niggas who trash rappin
worried bout the trendin fashions rather than ascendin passion
they want me send em tracks but i just send em laughter
right after i start laughin they start askin what happened
but back to the chapter
momma told me follow dreams should never have to ask her to
so thats what i do became an mc master
since then its been a disaster for you and your favorite rapper
go ahead ask em whos joey bad
watch em gasp asthma damn its so sad
he paused the chatter cause he know he rather back up
than to admit the kid is hotter than magma
but fuck it you gotta give credit where its due
cause you aint gon like the karma when its set up on you
it can get you on your medical fuck you up in the decimals
or get you two to three for residue found in your retinal
uh and they told me not to be so complex
dumb it down to accomplish articles in complex
and the source alfredo of course
there i go again steppin out of line runnin off course
i heard reports that its like sexual intercourse
with your thoughts when i talk about the shoes in which i walk
for it is not faux nor false that this kid from the north
speaks with forced supports of reinforced assaults
im sure by now you can assume he never lost
unless with some form of divorce or a corpse
born boss no days off child labor
let me see those in favor to spin that back like tornadoes
yeah

what the rap audience aint ready for is a real person
you know what i wanna say a real nigga
im coming at em one hundred real i aint compromising nothin
anybody that talk about me got problems you know what im sayin
its gonna be straightup like if i was a street person
thats how im comin at the whole world
and im being real about it and imma grow with my music

yeah but its far from over
wont stop til i meet hova and my mommas in a rover
til im an owner of the worlds finest motors
i blow like supernovas in your daughters room on a poster
known as historys biggest musical composer
no disrespect to bob mar but yeah another stoner
marijuana my odor and when i get older
hope my spermatozoa from my scrotum intercepts an ovum
like three times have three kids i hope
me  wife can show em not to make the same mistakes you know that we did
i hope they acknowledge the knowledge
cause yeah they gon need it
cause when my parents tried to tell me i just wouldnt receive it
couldnt believe it til i saw with my own pupils
felt bad when i learned that their advice was truly useful
but fuck it only made us as human beings more mutual
even though over time my punishments they grew more crucial
should use the word brutal cause my parents mad strict
hope one day ill attract the likes of even madlib
go gold on mad shit and hear my songs mastered
until then all i can do is imagine
imagine ima make it all happen

i want what i want how i want when i want it
ima keep it a hunnid im blunted
i dont give a damn i dont give a fuck about another man
fuck a brother man
ima make it make it rain like the weather man
old girl shoulda shoulda got a better man
ass fat lookin good in my letterman
in the hood im a better man
wish a mothafucka would would
whole life i been up to no good
change it all if i could
rearrange my heart the beat good but i cant
im a sinner not a saint
layers to my life no i cant
cover it up with paint
keep on livin livin
livin on money and women
as soon as im in em im out
now the truth never come out my mouth
speak life when i come in her mouth like

im a dirty mothafucka a waste of life a waste of skin
wanna repent dont know where to begin
next of kin dont give a damn bout me
i know god dont give a damn bout me
people try but dont know bout me
but the devil said that he want my soul
but the devil said that he want my soul
give it to me right now
give it to me right now
give it to me right now
give it to me right now

somebody save me
i need you to save me
to wash away my sins on high

id rather be a different man in another world
than work for the man in my universe
wonder what it feel like to take flight
momma told me everything gon be alright
i mean my life cant be off right
but come to think about it
everybody runnin the world seem to be all white
can you mothafuckas see alright
i mean i need it i want it i gotta have it
every day tragic
if youre from where im from everyday aint magic
on this i know
i been telling everybody ima give it a go i know
i been there before feel it in my soul oh i know
love it or hate it i made it
i did it i lived it
while the whole world lookin at the boy like whoa
baptized in a ocean of hennessey
really wonder what the remedy
tell me how the world gon remember me
got me feelin like the enemy
like i aint got no energy
i been lookin for an entity
feelin like i need to chill like i need a new amenity
fuck all that

im a dirty mothafucka a waste of life
a waste of skin
wanna repent dont know where to begin
next of kin dont give a damn bout me
i know god dont give a damn bout me
people try but dont know bout me
but the devil said that he want my soul
but the devil said that he want my soul
give it to me right now
give it to me right now
give it to me right now
give it to me right now

somebody save me
i need you to save me
to wash away my sins on high

i know my life was lived the wrong way
i know i did you wrong in my own way
but it was the flashing lights that mesmerized
that hypnotized the only
part of me you loved
part of me that had the strength to rise above
part of me you know
part of me you love more than to let it go

dear god i just wanna know why
why do you put us here
why do you put us below
why do you put us subservient
why do you put us below these evil motherfuckers
and then we crawl and we scratch our way out
we betray each other
we lie we take from one another
and we told you gon forgive us at the end
but the state dont forgive us
im locked up and half my friends
and then when i get out or i make it out
im expected to somehow give back
to people who never wanted to see me escape
im startin to hate the man in the mirror
and its gettin clearer
that society was designed to keep me on the bottom
so if you real if youre out there for real
please explain to me why
why do we suffer why do we die
and why do the people
who go against everything you ever said always get ahead
ive done so much wrong i dont know if i can ever be right
but tonight i am in this church
asking you to show yourself to reveal yourself to me
because im tired and i dont know what else to do
so black im blue so brown im down
i done been everywhere but up and when i finally get up
i am ravaged with guilt and pain and shame
and all i wanna do is believe in you
the darker you are the closer you are to dirt
and they make sure it hurts
and i am tired of hurtin man
im tired of bein looked at second guessed doubted feared
so if you out there do something about this
cause i cant take it no more

life is beautiful im so lucky to be alive
im gonna take this moment right now
here and school them people
i know deep in my heart everyone is created equal
i truly wish that i could see the sequel of our people
truly wish that i could check it
now when i hit the road and tour the world
i see like different light this music shit just aint the world
brothers and sisters from different mothers and misters
all different colors and creeds all come together for me
boy im blessed to be free uh

this is our time
still im looking back let me rewind
this is our ride
dont let me lose my faith let me rewind

doing seventy on this highway
on the front of this bus im busting my mind open
hoping these lyrics will keep me coping
on the grind like copin no time to bring the dope in
but this nyquil got me feeling lit
its been like three months since ive been home
sometimes it feel like forever just how long i been gone
yeah you know thats the shit that i been on
you know i love it feel like theres never enough of it
let me bring em back
chilling watching tarantino we know ive been on it forever
my endeavor like a feature film
step into the realm of the realest do you feel this
im in it my limit the chillest
let me bring em back yo
yeah i woke up early on my born twentyfive its a blessing
progression everyday lessons got me stressing
but im testing reminiscing
when i would listen to my intuition
and now i made it resurrecting
young sinatra i created im elated
it seem like everyones somehow related
letters back and forth from my homie
thats locked up in prison
doing fourteen its been five i know my hearts with him
ive been so busy it feel like forever since i hit him man
i think about how i wasnt shit when he went in
what if the tables was turned
and i was the one that been in damn
he said hes seen me in the magazine
he said hes seen me on fallon and kimmel
thats been my dog from the kennel
i never thought that out the millions watching he was one
it makes me reminisce about the times when we begun
skipping class with all of my homies
on a constant search for who i was
i rarely went to school they wonder why and thats because
my situation at home was alcoholics and drugs
i never graduated but i made it to the summit
dont get me wrong so many times
i thought that i would plummet
felt like i didnt have the heart and couldnt seem
to stomach all of the beef around my way
i mean i never wanted to live a life
where all youre truly living is a lie
i knew i always wanted more
and so they wonder why i said they wonder why

this is our time
still im looking back let me rewind
this is our ride
dont let me lose my faith let me rewind

you are watching a ma master at work
logic

i took her off the showroom floor no money down
near the chrysler building in the heart of midtown
two hundred horsepower under the hood
junk in the trunk very far from damaged goods
designer frames with windshields that stay tinted
the most beautiful thing someone invented
her wrangler had a sticker on the bumper
a sign in case tow trucks tried to dump her
rear view mirror that of serena william
staring was a crime then the look kill em
brushless showers and the brazilian wax
cash in the glove compartment free from tax
low mileage on the odometer
graduate with more degrees than a thermometer
spark plugs for great conversation
she would focus on the finish line and destination
steering in the right direction
made sure i wore seat belts had air bags for protection
in her tank she loved to stash my tool
i kept her full superunleaded fuel
she had a room full of skirts and rims
the old ones used to swing off ropes that often hung from limbs
a temp at the ford modeling agency
suburban area where the caucasians be
her greatgrandfather was a cherokee indian
explorer and navigator traveling then begin
sharpening his arrows on plymouth rock
commanderinchief who raise cattle on the selling of livestock
king of the frontier rider of thoroughbreds
he was just as sharp as a needle without thread
legend in truth but known to run the herd
his sons were oldsmobiles who drank thunderbird
land cruisers sitting on fertile soil
with equipment that ran off expensive oil
folks bragging said the horse pulled a volkswagen
they love mustang sally and lollygagging
fished in lake tahoe cooked the barracudas
hunted impalas with the sixshooters
from a long range with the dog rover
it was something else to see em knock them over

some got caught in the crossfire
bunch of rabbits indicating these dudes should retire
one was going bald rocking a sunroof
a gas guzzler in his grill was one tooth
a strong accent and a beard like lincoln
who hated the golf course but he loved drinking
avenger used to pick up chicks
had magnums that were ram tough but thick
he wore blazers where he used to hide the ruger
for encounters with the jaguars and cougars
a veteran who could salute and sing the anthem
in accord with the plan he was the phantom
he had a fat lady they called hummer
and umm she needed body work the whole summer
she had a few friends who used to stay in a pound
abandoned the parking lots and junk yard bound
regulars in rest areas and truck stops
cassette players known to make the tape pop
gold diggers who on the cream like wells fargo
in vegas they circle around the monte carlo
you know the snakes with the fangs and vipers
bloodsuckers who all used to piss from diapers
met the cavaliers at the outback steakhouse
chicken cutlets supreme just for takeout
one of them was forced to live in astoria
cause at the auction they had crowned victoria
since then her friends charged her battery
had her running off with the sweets of flattery
she kept a loud muffler couldnt trust her
police used to always pull over this duster
a pothead who some called a firebird
a foul mouth who could have used wiser words
her man used to hustle and ran a crack corner
so insecure he kept lojack on her
creeping with his visors low highbeaming
temper would accelerate private eye scheming
he would check her consoles for rubbers
she would pass the inspection with flying colors
she would turn left if he said right
on her cycle he would often run red lights
his voiced echoed as she dodged the convo
protools
her previous owner all he did was bone her
some drove her crazy she was just a loner
he had her leaking transmission fluids
said it was an accident didnt mean to do it
no insurance with her grill decayed
she sobbed uncontrollably still stayed
another total eclipse of the heart
like the freezing weather that never gave her a start
plus he had a sidekick in his garage
and if he needed a boost she would give him a charge
he was sentenced for running an escort service
escaped from prison but made a few nervous
his baby mother had wifed a bmw
number one on the list so he brought trouble to
she done everything to regain her liberty
tried to be outty but went into delivery
moved to aspen survived a avalanche
a different element inside a fatter ranch
far away when she changed the pattern
the distance was like from mercury to saturn

when a motherfucker steps out his place
and gets slapped in his motherfucking face
just because the motherfucker tried to base
the god the god
and while i see his whole clique pass us by
motherfuckers think they qualify
and for those niggas want to try
the god the god

yo im not caught up in politics
im no black activist on a socalled scholars dick
i come through with the wu and drop math
and versatile freestyle bombs and phonographs
and deliver all things in number and weight
searched to death on how living things relate
cause at a young age i was molded in a religion i relied on
and got caught up in superstition
scared to split pole ducked black cats
once in a while threw salt over my back
but with knowledge of self from off the shelf
made things seemed complicated now small like elves
so turn off the lights light a candle and have a seance
pull the lid off the dean martin scandal
witches warlocks spooks and holy ghosts
rza lets defraud the hoax

when a motherfucker steps out his place
and gets slapped in his goddamn face
just because the nigga wouldve tried to base
the god the god
and while i see his whole clique pass us by
motherfuckers think they qualify
and for those niggas want to try
the god the god

we were on the same ship when the slaves were checked
i had to pull your card you was on the top deck
so i plotted my escape i saw the thin line between love and hate
and fast from the hog on the plate
i suffered brutal pain from whips and chains
punishments that were set to wash the brain
so look listen observe and also respect this jewel
drawed up detect and reflect this
light i shine because my powers is refined
through the truth which manifest through eternal minds
purified gases and masses the same elements
that helped spark civilization classes
i see brothers quote math plus degrees
lip professin ass niggas cant feed they own seeds

when a nigga steps out his place
and gets slapped in his motherfucking face
just because the nigga wouldve tried to base
the god the god
and while i see his whole clique pass us by
motherfuckers think they qualify
and for those niggas want to try
the god the god
when a motherfucker steps out his place
and gets slapped in his goddamn face
just because the nigga wouldve tried to base
the god the god
and while i see his whole clique pass us by
motherfuckers think they qualify
and for those niggas want to try
the god the god

ive seen a kid
one night out at the spot
he had a wutang logo on his face
and just a tattoo this big
and a whole bunch of other shit carved on it
you dont see that often i mean
i mean ive never seen a gunit logo
on someones face or arm or
yknow not sayin that there isnt
but umm
i would say its sort of like a cult following
yknow but were just regular people
i mean i look
i look at myself as a regular person

age aint nothin but a number nothin but a number

rule number one never send a boy to fuck a grown ass lady
and respect the game cause the game is known to be
gone fast baby

sippin cold codeine and pulling up clean
popping up at the spot and dropping the top
and keep a bad yellow bop with my dick on rock uh

you cant get no house no car
no weed no bar no flash no show
no class no flow no help no love
no liquor no drug no clique no crew
no tracks to flow to no pager no phone
no flavor no zone no fiend no cut
no wife no slut no name
nowhere in the game to get me five
no nothing without that dirty ass money

my momma taught me what the value of a dollar should be
but everybody i saw balling was rolling selling keys
in the late eightys niggas pulling up on ds
putting dick up in these hoes and making em pay fees
learn how to ride dirty cause aint shit for free

her heart starts beatin her hands get clammy
cause she used to be stucked up now shes on my jammy
cause shes on it
and shes on it
her bedroom eyes they start to twitch
but she wont front cause shes got that itch
shed drop to her knees if id only say please
instead of counting sheep cold counting beasties

the sky is falling and the only thing that can save us now
is sensitivity and compassion
da da da dadada da da da
da da da dadada da da da ooohh
but i know one things for sure
im gonna get my kicks before it all burns down

yeah some say tragedys hard to get over
but sometimes that tragedy means its over
soldier from the academy league of rollers
i deny being down though they seem to hold us
my shoulders are strong i prove em wrong
i aint doing nothing but moving on let the truth be known
but they talked that freedom at us
and didnt even leave a ladder damn

i work at the corner store
we all got problems problems
no ones gonna fly down low
no ones gonna save us now
how you feel youre not alone
were all just jealous jealous
we dont reach the sky no more
we just cant overcome no

you tie my hands what am i gonna be
what have i done so bad what is my destiny
you tie my hands what am i suppose to see
what have i done so bad what am i gonna be

i knock on the door hope isnt home
fates not around the lucks all gone
dont ask me whats wrong ask me whats right
and imma tell you whats life and did you know
i lost everything but i aint the only the one
first came the hurricane then the morning sun
excuse me if im on one
and dont trip if i light one i walk a tight one
they tryna tell me keep my eyes open
my whole city underwater some people still floating
and they wonder why black people still voting
cause your president still choking
take away the football team the basketball team
and all we got is me to represent new orleans shit
no governor no help from the mayor
just a steady beating heart and a wish and a prayer
lets pray

these friends they come and go
but i got family family
these kids so fast they grow
they learn so quickly now
that theres nowhere to go
that theres no future future
dont make this here so low
and we cant overcome no

you tie my hands what am i gonna be
what have i done so bad what is my destiny
you tie my hands what am i suppose to see
what have i done so bad what am i gonna be

yeah and if you come from under that water then theres fresh air
just breathe baby gods got a blessing to spare
yes i know the process is so much stress
but its the progress that feels the best
cause i came from the projects straight to success
and youre next so try they cant steal your pride its inside
then find it and keep on grinding
cause in every dark cloud theres a silver lining i know

yeah yeah yeah
see right now we just riding on love
a shot in the dark
we aint tryin to do nothing but hit the heart
we need love
thats all yall thats all

you tie my hands what am i gonna be
what have i done so bad what is my destiny
you tie my hands what am i suppose to see
what have i done so bad what am i gonna be
you tie my hands what am i gonna be
what have i done so bad what is my destiny
you tie my hands what am i suppose to see
what have i done so bad what am i gonna be

yeah born right here in the usa

til we took they shit now its time to floss we lock and load

so youre the motherfucker they call immortal technique
what the fuck make you so special nigga
huh what the fuck do you do

i calculate planet alignment like mayan astronomy
discoverin atrocities
worse than aristotle subjectin children to sodomy
your theory of the galaxy is primitive like ptolemy
the truth about the universe dug up like aztec pottery
unpredictable results like experimental psychology
i stomp the streets with emcees beneath my feet in colonies
but presentation and spirit revolve around autonomy
searchin for monogamy
and cuttin fake bitches out of my mind like a lobotomy
so obviously im not gonna be here to play games
walk the top of the world and leave the arctic circle in flames
battle the beast and false prophet predicted in the king james
i give a fuck about your emcee name i dont admire you
only by dental records will you be identifiable
cause the future is not reliable
remember when rap was not economically viable
comparable to what motherfuckers think of me
i might be nobody but wait til im together like a symphony
resoundin sound that will continue infinitely
angel of death punishin all those who live in infamy
and shine so far away from you
youll never get a glimpse of me
attempts to extinguish me dont even bother me none
like retarded kids throwin ice cubes at the sun
a victory against immortal technique will never be done
just degrees of losin it every second youre addin one
some niggas dream of pushin kilos but i drop tons
with more facts and formulas and philosophical logic
then a basement full of scientists puffin on chronic
dip the mic in potassium cyanide and liquid bubonic
and use it as a sonic wand to find the spawn of the demonic
screamin like onyx is of absolutely no consequence
the poison is dense enough to clog up your arteries
mercy is not a part of me
i cause you bodily injury permanently
because simply verbally murdering me
is inconceivable cause of the unbelievable evil injected inside
the blood stream of my people
and redemption is not located under a church steeple
the feeble and the meek in soul just like the technique
will inherit the earth but the earth will be weak
mother earth in her decrepit terminal illness physique
the year three thousand is bleak no happily ever after
just death following the fourth reich disaster
a legacy of bastards with plastic explosives
your futures been eroded cause you forgot that when your free its multiplied indefinitely
by the struggle that be the struggle i see
to socialistically unite the third world countries
expose hypocrisy in americas democracy
sloppily obsessed with stoppin me cause i speak prophecy
trample and dismantle your capitalist philosophy
the same way i stomp the conquerin rap monopoly
and im not a fuckin prophet but thats the fuckin prophecy

i never make songs to disrespect women
or to judge people about the way that theyre livin
but the way i am is based on the life i was given
like them white boys losin my religion
i used to be a christian and a political pawn
the bible is right and all your native culture is wrong
next thing you know you tellin me bout makin a song
come in the studio and tell me that im makin it wrong
pissed off cause reality is makin us strong
like the ghost of timothy mcveigh makin a bomb
ayo marvin gaye what the fuck is goin on
these rap niggas made propaganda out of your song
but its the gong show amateur night at the apollo
my dick is like my music but harder to swallow
so children follow me like the pied piper
and sing the chorus in the air with your blunt and your lighter

you played yourself thinkin youre down with me
i end your life nigga dont fuck around with me
and if you kids cant listen then youre bound to see
the way you get shot for crossin the boundary
you played yourself thinkin youre down with me
i end your life nigga dont fuck around with me
and if you kids cant listen then youre bound to see
the way you get shot for crossin the boundary

the second verse is worse than the first in disrespect
scripted specifically to keep people in check
harlem to boston real niggas spit with me
but landspeed you aint fuckin shit to me
and underground labels know that i dont trust you
youre only independent til youre major so fuck you
and if youre pissed off cause you think that i dissed you
ill rape your moms so we can make this a personal issue
dance with the devil remember that youre not on my level
stupid youre not ready
i won disypher bragging rights from rocksteady
and practically every battle that they got in new york
and i still murder rappers on the street for sport
doctor guillotine cuttin you short little man
but you dont give me props cause i never won at scribble jam
well fuck you i hope someone you love dies
so fuck your crew and fuck your family too
technique said it bitch what the fuck you gonna do

you played yourself thinkin youre down with me
i end your life nigga dont fuck around with me
and if you kids cant listen then youre bound to see
the way you get shot for crossin the boundary
you played yourself thinkin youre down with me
i end your life nigga dont fuck around with me
and if you kids cant listen then youre bound to see
the way you get shot for crossin the boundary

yeah wrap it up on these niggas
wrap it up yeah

immortal technique incinerates degenerate fags
burn trent lott wrapped in his confederate flag
i got the beretta with my face wrapped in a rag
so put the african slave jewelry in the bag
motherfuckers tell me that a diamond is forever
but is it worth the blood of malcolm and medgar evers
house niggas get your head severed tryin to be thug
you dont concern me im tryin to hurt the people you love
word of mouth is im in the club bein sneaky
im like the body snatchers and your girl is gettin sleepy
i murder you indiscreetly right at the source
like the roman legionnaire that stabbed christ on the cross
this is about you though it aint about jesus
and you shouldnt fuckin talk about telekenesis
nigga please movin shit with your mind
try movin your moms out the projects with your rhymes
and next time im comin after cualquiera
profanity fuckin carajo maldita mierda
roll up the hierba y pasala para la izquierda
put the price up to listen to me pop shit
cause i got martha stewart givin me stock tips
underground money with honeys up in the whip
bangbuscom nigga fuckin your bitch

yeah played yourself nigga fuck all of yall
you dont know shit about me
why open your mouth and discuss who the fuck i am
i thought i told yall niggas on volume one
i wasnt fuckin around you just slept
cause you sold a few thousand units in the golden era
when niggas would buy anything on the shelf
but those days are through and you are through with them

self selfpity selfself pity
why the fuck is everybody else giddy
i woke up and felt shitty
matter fact i felt the same all week
let down like my last album on the shelf sitting
and i think i might need help getting out of bed
cause im here and i keep spinning out of thread
im my own worst critic and i gotta write a album
but i keep hating on myself its like i get obsessed
cause i hate what i write say something tight
i be thinking too much wondering what they gonna like
i dont got a lot of fans im afraid that i might
let em down if what i make dont relate to them right
if it dont then they aint gonna buy my record
and if my second doesnt sell better than the last
imma owe the record label cash
so its hard to relax and write raps
i be losing concentration sometimes
i look at what they saying online
somebody unfollowed me and call me out cause i aint respond
im behind on my deadline and i got a home life
to juggle aint no freetime
my manager clowning what you write another deep song
what is it this time your lady your struggle trying to be something
not in the mood to write a weed song
i take the beat and give myself a mental beatdown when i rap

im my own worst enemy the energy i haves a waste
cause i use it battling myself cause im a basket case
da da da da im a basket case
da da da da im a basket case
staring at this glass of whiskey wishin i would pass away
but im always wishing for the worst cause im a basket case
da da da da im a basket case
da da da da im a basket case

i cant have conversation with rappers
im not an asshole to anyone unless i have a reason to be
but god forbid if they ever had a buzz or a name
then they feel like we are equal and these dudes always want a feature for free
i try to network and help em out i just gave em a tweet
but im starting to wonder if the shoe was on the other foot
would these motherfuckers do the same favor for me
but on the other hand people think im all famous
i aint half as paid as you think when i tell em what the price is
to get me on a record they act like its too expensive just to pay me a g
and im starting to feel guilty
cause im known as the guy who never quit and never gave up his dreams
so a bunch of dudes tell me that i gave them motivation
not to quit and they gon try to do the same thing as me but
only difference is i spent fifteen plus years studying my favorite mcs
so i kept getting better some of yall aint got it cant hear it but its blatant to me
and i dont want to hurt their feelings so i tell em that the music that they making is tight
but your image looks bad and you suck and you need to give up and youre wasting your life
and its all my fault damn

im my own worst enemy the energy i haves a waste
cause i use it battling myself cause im a basket case
da da da da im a basket case
da da da da im a basket case
staring at this glass of whiskey wishin i would pass away
but im always wishing for the worst cause im a basket case
da da da da im a basket case
da da da da im a basket case

they tell me that i need to tweet more but i feel kind of immature typing my thoughts online
plus the fans that i got will probably hate me if they knew what type of shit that crossed my mind
cause i hate rap
let me take that back i just hate whack rappers for the most part
even though i rap fast i dont like when people try to impress me with doubletime
and they be swearing that they go so hard
they dont really even say shit
anyone can rhyme thinkin and drinkin and sinkin
inside my lincoln and think its dope it aint about the speed
you gotta make it make sense
and did i mention that i really hate fake fans
i dont understand how one minute everyone could be on your dick and they say you hot
a year later the same fans steady be talkin shit bout that rapper actin like they forgot
thats how the shit works
first they love you then they hate you then they love you again
you gotta toughen your skin
this kind of shit hurts
this music industry is dumb dumber than the comments on youtube
saying that i use the nword hell naw
i dont rap like that i dont hang around white boys who act like that
i done said too much bout to snap im mad
at the world even i dont really have my back when i rap its like damn

im my own worst enemy the energy i haves a waste
cause i use it battling myself cause im a basket case
da da da da im a basket case
da da da da im a basket case
staring at this glass of whiskey wishin i would pass away
but im always wishing for the worst cause im a basket case
da da da da im a basket case
da da da da im a basket case

yeah
sometimes i just get fucking pissed off
i just get sick of all this bullshit

shits sad growing up in the gutter
but i made a lot of kids want to be like i am
its weird people see you on the come up
think you happy with some money but im mean and im pissed
my girlfriend knows that i love her
but i mentally abuse her and i treat her like shit
we both suicidal she a cutter
all i do is selfloath whats the reason i live
bunch of empty liquor bottles in the cupboard
lying to each other like next week well quit
get drunk make a straw outta dollar
but its okay its only cocaine not meth
my family looking at me like a fuck up
and theyre right and i dont want to disappoint my twin
i pray one day ill recover
but its like im tryin to schedule an appointment with the  devil
lord knows i dont wanna  die
so im begging praying help me please
i lie like im covering for someone
with anxiety and i aint got no selfesteem
lot of people are going wanna tell me shut up
cause they got it way worse im a selfish piece of shit
make a motherfucker wonder what its gonna take for me to change mentally
bags underneath my eyes cause i live too fast
grey hairs on my beard
feelin like i cant breathe if i dont take a pill so im always on a xan
drink a bottle every night i feel them doing damage to my liver
i aint ever been this fat and disgusting
i dont wanna rap i wanna nap on my loveseat
i aint sayin this to get no pity im just feelin shitty
lookin like a piece of metal rusting and trust me

and i dont really like
the person ive become
this isnt who i thought i would turn into when i was young
but now im grown and they say im
no good xsix
im just a drug addict drunk im
no good xsix
they say i need to turn my life around

i dont know maybe im a hater
im supposed to write a rap but i hate rap now
stop breathin when im sleeping then i wake up
still in my clothes cant remember how i passed out
lately im an angry drunk am im afraid i
might have been a dick best friends gettin cussed out
but fuck it then i guess ill found out later
what i done nother hungover day bummed out
true shit i aint no exaggerator
nose bleedin trying to act like i aint sniff shit
people think theyre motivating me to take up a different lifestyle
fuck them and their fitbit
they just wanna help but dont appreciate uh
cause they love me and they dont wanna see me die young
every day im dissapointin my creator
ive been strugglin to get up out the hole i dug
lately ive been switchin over to the vapor
chain smokin newports hope i dont crush my lungs
i can see my future and its as plain as day my
girl cryin to the operator calling nine hundred and eleven
i tour blessed to be an entertainer
been spendin months away from home theres nothing i find fun
signed a record deal i love the record label
three albums later underrated when its my time come
couldnt afford the tour bus so i went and bought a van
theres some money selling records so i got to tour again
i dont wanna bore the fans so i bought a couple lights
plus some background singers but i cant afford a band
jealous of these rich rappers and the money that they make
i was up outside of chilis having lunch and a lame
started rooting for his team on the screen
when i see happy people wanna punch them in the face
im ashamed cause

i dont really like
the person ive become
this isnt who i thought i would turn into when i was young
but now im grown and they say im
no good xsix
im just a drug addict drunk im
no good xsix
they say i need to turn my life around

yeah

your money gone sweeter than some honeycomb
gettin money long till youre freaking phone bill
go on cut it on

get in mine hit the guardrail
trynna work but the cards dealt
and still flex on em like im doing curls with a barbell
traffic in and out my house like its a yard sale
i be in the crib with a blonde bombshell
livin like a kingpin did it with the inkpen
shit im sayin make sense when it sink in
im distinctive pinky ring pimp
spittin shit that you think spin in distinction
like the horn of a rhino or elephant tusk
soarin through the sky like a pelican does
snort a bunch of white when im feelin the buzz
you sayin you supported i can tell youre jealous of us
but thats cool with me cause my fanbase thick
youre wounded again make the bandaid stick
its a movement you can shit the campaign bitch
light the fuse and im lit like a lampshade is
every verse im going on one of my rampages
let the champagne fizz
i can show you how to get paid
but they just went and stole my template
trynna copy me but they could never be this caliente bitch

time for me to bring the hardcore back
got em feeling like déjà vu

motherfucker shut the fuck up when im talkin lil bitch
im sorry wait whats your talent oh critiquin

to give a subpar bar or even have an opinion or view
you mention me millions of views attention in news

billions of views your ten cents are two
skim through the music to give shit reviews
to get clicks but bitch you just lit the fuse
dont get misconstrued business as us

or get dissed cause i just dont get
what the fuck half the shit is that youre listenin to
do you have any idea how much i hate this choppy flow
everyone copies though probly no
get this fuckin audio out my audi yo adiós
i can see why people like lil yachty but not me though
not even dissin it just aint for me
all i am simply is just an emcee
maybe stan just isnt your cup of tea get it
maybe your cups full of syrup and lean
maybe i need to stir up shit preferably
shake the world up if it were up to me
paul wants me to chill yall want me to ill
i should eat a pill probably i will
old me killed the new me watch him bleed to death
i breathe on the mirror i dont see my breath
possibly im dead i must be possessed
like an evil spell im evil evil spelled
jam a crest whitestrip in the tip of my dick
with an ice pick stick it in a vise grip
hang it on a spike fence bang it with a pipe wrench
while i take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
like vicepresident mike pence
back up on my shit in a sidekick as i lay it on a spike strip
these are things that id rather do than hear you on a mic
since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
jesus christ man how many times is
someone gonna fuck on my bitch fuck my side chick
you wont ever see em icy
but as cold as i get on the mic
i polarize shit so the temps might freeze
and your skull might split like i bashed you upside it
bitch i got the club on smash like a nightstick yeah
turn down for what
i aint loud enough nah turn the valium up
cause i dont know how im gonna get your mouths to shut
now when it doesnt matter what caliber
i spit at ill bet a hundred thousand bucks
youll turn around and just be like man how the fuck
sourpuss gonna get mad just cause his album sucks
and now he wants to take it out on us ooouuu
but last week an exfan mailed me a copy
of the mathers lp to tell me to study
itll help me get back to myself and shell love me oooouuu
i mailed the bitch back and said if i did that
id just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
especially an effing recovery clone of me nfing
so fingerbang chicken wang mgk igg azae
lil pump lil xan imitate lil wayne
i should aim at everybody in the game pick a name
im fed up with bein humble
and rumor is im hungry im sure you heard bumblings
i heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
i heard your mumblin but its jumbled in mumbojumbo
the era that im from will pummel you thats what its comin to
what the fuck youre gonna do when you run into it
im gonna crumble you and ill take a number two
and dump on you if you aint joyner
if you aint kendrick or cole or sean then youre a goner
im bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
i guess when you walk into bk you expect a whopper
you can order a quarter pounder when you go to mcdonalds
but if youre lookin to get a porterhouse you better go get revival
but yall are actin like i tried to serve you up a slider
maybe the vocals shoulda been autotuned
and you woulda bought it
but sayin i no longer got it
cause you missed a lot and never caught it
cause it went over your head because youre too stupid to get it
cause youre mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest
with your expertise and knowledge but youll never be an artist
and im harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
what ill never be is flawless all ill ever be is honest
even when im gone theyre gonna say i brought it
even when i hit my forties like a fuckin alcoholic
with a bottle full of malt liquor
but i couldnt bottle this shit any longer
the fact that i know that ima hit my bottom
if i dont pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
i dont see why yall even started with me
i get in beefs my enemies die
i dont cease fire til at least all are deceased
im east side never be caught slippin
now you see why i dont sleep not even a wink i dont blink
i dont doze off i dont even nod to the beats
i dont even close my fuckin eyes when i sneeze
aw man that bet cypher was weak it was garbage
the thing aint even orangeoh my god thats a reach
shout to all my colorblind people
each and everyone of yall if you call a fire engine green
aquamarine or you think water is pink
dawg thats a date  looks like an olive to me
look theres an apple no its not its a peach
so fingerbang pootie tang
burger king gucci gang dookie dang
charlamagne gonna hate anyway doesnt matter what i say
give me donkey of the day
what a way for two thousand and eighteen to get underway
but im gonna say everything that i wanna say
welcome to the slaughterhouse bitch yeah
invite em in like a one a day
im not done preach
cause i feel like the beast of burden
that line in the sand was it even worth it
cause the way i see people turnings
makin it seem worthless its startin to defeat the purpose
im watchin my fan base shrink to thirds
and i was just tryin to do the right thing but word
has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
or still yet to be determined
cause im determined to be me critiqued or worshipped
but if i could go back id at least reword it
and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent
sold the dream to that hes deserted
but i think its workin
these verses are makin him a wee bit nervous
and hes too scurred to answer me with words
cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
but i know at least hes heard it
cause agent orange just sent the secret service
to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin him
or ask if im linked to terrorists
i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists
but my beef is more media journalists
hold up hold up hold up
i said my beef is more meaty a journalist
can get a mouthful of flesh
and yes i mean eating a penis
cause they been pannin my album to death
so i been givin the media fingers
dont wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
but they been puttin me through the ringer
so i aint ironin shit out with the press
but i just took this beat to the cleaners

a crew to stomp and then two feet to rinse

but then she comes back to me

my baby girl keeps gettin older

people make jokes cause they dont understand me
they just dont see my real side
i act like shit dont faze me inside it drives me crazy
my insecurities could eat me alive
but then i see my baby suddenly im not crazy

everyones leanin on me

if i could hit the notes id blow somethin as long as my father
to show her how i feel about her how proud i am that i got her
god im a daddy im so glad that her mom didnt reh tnaw
now you probably get this picture from my public persona
that im a pistolpackin drug addict who bags on his momma
but i wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
cause theres a lot of shit i keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul
and just know that i grow colder the older i grow
this boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
and this load is like the weight of the world and i think my neck is breakin
should i just give up or try to live up to these expectations
now look i love my daughter more than life in itself
but i got a wife thats determined to make my life livin hell
but i handle it well given the circumstances im dealt
so many chances man its too bad coulda had someone else
but the years that ive wasted is nothin to the tears that ive tasted
so heres what im facin three felonies six years of probation
ive went to jail for this woman ive been to bat for this woman
ive taken bats to peoples backs bent over backwards for this woman
man i shoulda seen it comin whatd i stick my penis up in
wouldnt have ripped the prenup up if ida seen what she was fuckin
but fuck it its over theres no more reason to cry no more
i got my baby baby the only lady that i adore
hailie so sayonara try tomorrow nice to know ya
our babys traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
and suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted

hardcore lyric comin at ya they attackin ya
rappers bite like dracula the soul of hiphop
im puttin back in ya with the south bronx vernacular
bound to put the crack in your armor i am much sharper
than a lot of other mic rockers slightly eccentric
but everythings authentic when i said im hiphop i meant it
emcees wanna debate the issue but false though
if they studied they would see that they are hiphop also
hiphop you cant do it you gots to be it
you cant confine it you have to free it so you can see it
as your expression and learn the lesson on life in ghetto sections
and what you feel is the forward direction
for black people not these star wars save that for rtwodtwo
i got five fingers like bruce lee do
and with the five fingers i grab microphones and bring the
stinger to djs rappers singers and beer drinkers
this mcs a thinker unlike others but i wont diss yaz
youre still my brothers and sisters kris is
one aspect of hiphop rap
negative rap positive rap forget that black its a trap
to set us back concentrate on various rap talents
presently the rap radio format is unbalanced
you either got the player or the concious rhyme sayer
all day on your radio not with a different flavor
someone has to die before you hear a concious record
people dont like gangsta rap but concious rap they dont respect it
the truth is people are afraid of black youth
our expressions our lessons and gold teeth so

they tried to harm me i used to be malcolm x
now im on the planet as the one called krs
kickin the metaphysical spiritual tryin to like
get with you showin you you are invincible
the black panther is the black answer for real
in my spiritual form i turn into bobby seale
on the wheels of steel my spirit flies away
and enters into kwame ture

in the streets there is no eq no didodidodido
so i grab the air and speak through the code
the devil cannot see through as i unload
into another cerebellum
then i can tell em because my vibes go through denim
and leather whatever however im still rockin
we used to pick cotton now we pick up cotton when we shoppin
have you forgotten why we buildin in a cypher
yo hear me kid government is building in a pyramid
the son of god is brighter than the son of man
the spirit is check your dollar bill g here it is
we got no time for fancy mathematics
your mental frequency frequently pickin up static
makin you a naked body addict and its democratic
they press auto and you kill it with an automatic

we lead em to freedom or poetically beat em up
in conventions like meet em see them we plan to eat em up
im bein mcin seein and agreein that this here cut
definitely will hit them up so we sing

i scream on these rappers like directors do actors
hang with computer hackers on farms and ride tractors
thug spelled backwards is gut drop the h
if you aint got guts and you callin yourself a thug you a fake
not just the guts to bust off fortyfour calibre
cause mad thugs turn bitch when you show that ass algebra
its like the vexed look the sex look
the checks look cause brothers be scared of that textbook
you best look elsewhere knowledge of self here
never no welfare echinicea for health care
outrappin em slappin em ghetto scholar like pun joey crack and them
on spraypaint we put fat caps on em word
up in the yard we go to hittin it harder
then return to reprieve as mildmannered kris parker
the exec signin on checks approvin budgets

nore goes what what cube goes yehyeah
jamaicans go buck buck mc eiht goes gyeah
master p goes unghhh busta rhymes goes yah yah

 with ad libs

the prophecy is fulfilled

i drop the rawest beats
you dont really want it
no ice just heat
you dont really want it
playa face defeat

that was a nice try nelly i dont mean to be bold
but put that hot in herre bullshit on hold
and lets get down to the facts of the matter
in the dictionary under whack rap you the rapper
its simply cuz youre lacking the spectacular vernacular
and hip hops character seems to be in back of ya
either that or youre truly amateur im asking ya
how does it feel to have the whole world laughin at ya
you just too stupid to see
i was made on the streets you was made on mtv
how you gonna talk about my nose to attack me
when you steady guzzling them pills for your acne
my nose comes from a line of kings
your acne comes from you eatin the wrong things
your words dont make me hurt they make you work
youll hurt when you find its you getting jerked
i tell ya it dont take me to say
dont buy your album street cats aint buying it anyway
you telling me make up my mind
yet on your album you dont know if you wanna sing or rhyme

you trying to diss me how
if it wasnt for the trueschool your bitchass wouldnt be here now
blau blau show me respect from the gate
or imma have to drown you kids like andrea yates
you cant handle the break im a flamethrower you a bic lighter
you think im cocky cuz you a dick rider
i spit tighter im not like all the rest
im not a playa but i did stay at a holiday inn express
so nevertheless imma teach ya teach ya
but when them slugs hit you youll be screaming momma ei ei
you never seen me sing you dont know what i bring
youll be singing the blues like bb king
im all about the unity of miss and mistas
you all about grabbing money and dissing our sistas
take your ass back to tv land
and let this be a lesson you cant see me man

just when i thought i could do my gospel
and become an apostle i got a whole to get hostile
i dont mean to knock ya nelly
but aint you that mtv house nigga with a spine like jelly
imma do this by the book for the art

she blew me a kiss and gave a bitter frown
like how can we get rid of this clown
me and her sat down he got a little jealous
cause his punk ass sat in the middle of us

the sun reflecting off the corals colors i cant describe

used to want a briefcase and a short commute
used to wanna sell coke and whip an audi coupe
crazy if i did that wouldnt be talking to you
walking through the pitfalls of a college student
crazy how you get them letters and that make you feel accepted
til you walking round the campus and you the only african
nobody with passion just cats that take direction well
take acid trips to find themselves well

i gotta get better at being me being who i am
i gotta get better at everything being who i am

im trying to look for motivation of smaller things
but baby steps to my atonement when i foster dreams
ive been told im too transparent with my thoughts sometimes
so i wrote songs until they pass and i can fall in line
i fell apart the moment that you thought you found yourself
cause i knew at that point i couldnt be in the equation anymore
but moving on with open broken hearts
will show you everything you need to see about yourself to start moving forward
so many things i wanna say that im not sure need to be known
but everybody swears they fucking know me
so why dont i lay every card im holding on the table
at that point i wonder what theyd show me
i almost lost my father still surreal for me to think about
considering how many of my friends have lost theirs
i never know if what im saying is the right thing
if not im ready more than ever for the crosshairs
its all fair when its not you
some people have angels what if only shadows follow you
and all the ghosts inside that seem to hollow you
the branches of the weeping willow start to swallow you
and then you realize youre exactly where youre supposed to be
the horizon clears you wipe the tears
and all the skeletons are ready for your story

new music  music
babymaking music your main lady shaking to it
this the feeling teachers never gave to students
who get paid too little to raise the stupid
who learn more from gangster music than basic schoolin
a whole generation of angry youth who get mistaken as a pain or a nuisance
distracted by the fame and jewelry a country where we praise the wicked and shame the clueless
when the enemy is within who do you aim the nuke at
are we really at the top or is that just howre we are trained to view it
i wonder who made the blueprint is it the same bloodline that enslaved the jewish
built ships and chained us to it paid a sniper to aim at luther
took the world trade flew planes into it and framed the muslims
this probably sounds like a scene from your favorite movie
well wake up wake up it dont take brains to do it it take bank to do it
welcome to the capital where only the greatest do it
good intentions is what the road to hell is paved with usually
and bitches swimming bottomless in bottomless ace of spade jacuzzis
drowning in my own lust i had to drain the fluid out the group think think tank
i outgrew the fishbowl i snapped your fucking fishing pole
fuck opinions they just want me trapped and fucking pigeonholed
now snap a fucking picture hoe
got me feelin like i dont get it you dont get it
yeah theres truth but who gon spit it
yeah i could say it but who gon get it
complicated fuckin lyrics who gon listen
we all fuckin hated math now who wants physics
i aint speaking to you all cause you all get it
but see theres projects from duval to new york city
you ever wonder why its called the projects
picture the statue of liberty in a thot dress
i leave you all to your thoughts to process
sincerely yours truly god bless

the closer that you get
the closer that you get to me
thats just a road that gon hurt you
hurt you
i know i said some shit
i know i said some shit i dont mean
but girl we know thats what words do
words do
your body says it first your body says it first
so when you open up your lips to speak
just know i already heard you
heard you
i told you i aint shit
but still you wanna be with me
we both know i dont deserve you
im only gon hurt you

im not gon change for you you cant fix me cause im not broken
before you develop feelings lets put the real in the open
you could give me your heart that still dont mean that i own it
its like walking the tightrope between logic and our emotions
i dont know why the storys always the same
two people fall in love til they go separate ways
im savage by nature so blame my creator
so much pussy thrown at me i need a coordinator
eh every girl thinks shes the one hundredth girl i done slept with
when i aint even got enough time to check all my messages
look i grew up around woman
so i never felt the need to rush and get settled down with em
i know i dont speak for all men i speak for me
so you dont commit your life to someone who aint gon keep it a g
embrace the good the bad the ugly
cause theres certain shit in this man that just cant adjusted
i know the truth is like alcohol
you think you can handle it til you cant stand at all
tryna manage with a damaged heart
if every nigga aint shit then really whos the fault
we both know what we here to do
i get my bluntness is offending you
i guess im young and hypocritical
i want the sex but not the spiritual residue
and you want something magical
cartoon and fairytales conditioning what come natural
out of touch with the actual using sex as collateral
confusion occurs when ones own beliefs are incompatible

fights all the time you say you fine
i know you lyin its on your mind
and i aint blind i often find
you dont have to cut the knife just untie the line

the closer that you get
the closer that you get to me
thats just a road that gon hurt you
hurt you
i know i said some shit
i know i said some shit i dont mean
but girl we know thats what words do
words do
your body says it first your body says it first
so when you open up your lips to speak
just know i already heard you
heard you
i told you i aint shit
but still you wanna be with me
we both know i dont deserve you
im only gon hurt you

i got a new confession
i battle with depression
i got a lotta trust issues
i guess i feel neglected
i used to have a message
now im just fucking reckless
i spend a lotta time
just tryna be accepted
i cancelled all my shows
i burned all my clothes
im going out my mind
i just need to be alone

it just rolls and it rolls

when you express your finesse to your dress code
every steps a pose youve been blessed and it shows
my interest grows the effervesce explodes
because this chicks characteristics mystic
hips are thick just a little bit of lipstick
cant resist it description egyptian smile
queen of the nile that means she dipped in style
she remind of nefretiti yes indeedy
but its hard to get it like hieroglyphic graffiti
studied her exhibits and checked her colorful curves
intellect with swerves i coulda wrecked my nerves
thats my word diggin her enigma that exist
in a sister carefully wrapped in her figure
we connect like a collision and hug just to knowledge
her wisdom speed up my metabolism show me love

your mo is hard not to notice so my motives
is to stay focused body moves like aerobics
attractions vibes i caught came from your ways
and actions but mindframe hard to explain
no actin or mindgames but thinkin of what can happen
is migraines the xrated though remains
we relaxin and you naggin me for the agony
to your anatomy by the fractions
your measurements the pleasures in every inch of your temple
i travel twentythree million miles of your mental
chemistry between you and me in harmony
causin angles to meet like trigonometry
or pyramids thats where your deepest treasures are hid
then it gets odiferous cause i know where it is
i mastered that cause its easy when you react
the allnatural aphrodisiac show me love

holy are you
holy are you
there is no god but you
there is no god but you
praised be the lord

for those who find it hard to believe and it is
why they call me the god mc the lyricist
trace this down to the roots from genesis
the world wonder im still standing like pyramids
design so vivid every brick it got a story to tell
my rhyme flow different like a hieroglyphic
mind prolific infinite like mathematic
the first language now add that and add graphics
then go let the blocks know its the gospel
lifes new manual so watch close
the new michelangelo and pablo picasso
prepared to show you the cosmos and rock flows
even my lyrical metaphysical
what thisll do is help you get to your spiritual pinnacle
you find your mind too farfetched for it to fathom
i bring the darkness to the light split the atom
its like watching the big bang theory emerge
i take titles bond them to reveal new words
they want a clear view
from the farthest and the darkest corners of the universe
to a corner near you
a pharaoh in ghetto apparel stay blinged up
fort knox display a modern day king tut
wrapped tight rap like ive been preserved in time
spit the holy water then touch it and turn it to wine
its the god

we were children of the most high so we fell
from paradise to holy hell
probably descendants of the holy grail
another part of history they wont reveal
timesll only tell
you waiting for judgment it came
in the form of a thug in the game
to create a strong position theres blood in my vein
the chemical is identical we one and the same
with seven letters in all three of my government names
walk on water nah neither did jesus
its a parable to make followers and readers believers
from egypt to budapest rakim is the truest left
understand the scriptures like the minister louis f
i told you who god is you ignored me like most the prophets
jesus solomon abraham moses and muhammad
i showed the scholars well fulfill the broken promise
i spit this truth to predict the future like nostradamus
like revelations im hoping my quotes reveal
the seven spirits of god when i open the seal
interpret the holy quran these flows will guide you
translate the torah and decode the bible
warn the elders in the mosques masons and the law
the seven churches the synagogues its the renaissance
skin is bronze like the messiah
rakim allahs about to reveal the biggest secret in time men are god

okay last time this is drugs

the only sign of a murder was the blood on the foresteps
i stopped for a second to wipe it up
and threw the bloody towel in the garbage bag with her guts
pretty as a picture her name was rosie
had to kill the bitch cuz she was getting too fuckin nosey
a school ho she attended u of h
a law student who was looking for a fuckin case
but she was barking up the wrong tree g
ay yo why in the hell did the bitch wanna fuck with me
walking around my crib steady casin
askin about the strange smells that were coming from my basement
she asked one too many motherfuckin questions it was time
somebody taught the stupid bitch a good lesson
i snuck in the house through the back door
it was like a scene from psycho
the bitch was in the shower
i rushed her quick so she wouldnt have a chance to holler
and said shut the fuck up ho
and slammed her motherfucking head against the cold floor
struggling soaking wet
i gagged her mouth with a whole box of kotex
after i fucked her check out what i did
slit her fucking stomach and watched her squeal like a pig
the shit was gruesome g i couldnt call it
i cut off her fingers and flushed them down the fuckin toilet
then wrote my name on the wall like i usually do
to mark a murder ho yeah on murder avenue

more murder more murder more murder yo
more murder more murder more murder watch me hurt a ho
more murder more murder motherfucking murder nigga
more motherfucking murder gots ta pull the trigger
more murder more murder more murder check it
a hundred and fifty seven thousand victims in a second

gotta give it up to bridget and ted brand new newlyweds
theres nothing i would love better than to have their fuckin heads
on a platter i watch them sonofabitches scatter
in broad daylight but yo it really didnt matter
i put the gun to their heads and said shut up
the nigga was big i watched this big motherfucker nut up
on the rampage both of em got pistolwhipped
the nine was bloody so i pulled out my pistol grip
the nigga was damn near dead
i grabbed his bitch by her head and told her spread your fucking legs
i placed the barrel of my pump on her pearl tongue
and stuck a shell inside her pussy and said now aint that fun
she started to cry
i saw a tear fall from here eye said bitch you must wanna die
i pulled the trigger of the pump back slowly
and shot up her nigga until he was full of holes g
the bitch was screaming with rage
i stamped on her motherfucking face until it caved in
cos killing is so damn sweet
i saved the remains and used them later for ground meat
being a lunatic i gotta do the lunatic
gotta do man yeah living on this avenue

more murder more murder more murder yo
more murder more murder more murder watch me hurt a ho
more murder more murder more murder nigga
more motherfucking murder gots ta pull the trigger
more murder more murder more murder check it
a hundred and fifty seven thousand victims in a second

theres far too many of you dying

june twentyeight was the date
thirtyeight to the chest plate
mommy dears cryin at the wake
and everybodys dressed up in black suits
goin to pay their last respects to the black troop
whyd he have to die is the question that were under
but everyone knows that every days a different number
so when your time comes just remember g
youll always have a place in this world as a memory
especially my boys who passed away back in ninetytwo
best believe that all the boys in the hoods got love for you
wherever we go wherever we be we be thinkin
of how we hung in the clubs smokin and drinkin
never missin out on a hood fight
cause everyday back in the hood we had a good fight
everything has changed and people are lookin lonely
its gon be strange spendin new years eve without your homie
but aint much that we can do
except pour brew throughout the crew
to make sure we all remember you
and believe me it hurts
to see the boy you broke bread with six feet in the dirt dirt

another homie got smoked but its no surprise
everybodys trippin cause the boy was too young to die
a sad sight to see my homie take his last breath
everybodys trippin cause they cant accept my homies death
another killin was reported on the evenin news
somebodys brother got killed behind a pair a shoes
in the midst of all this shit i think about myself
wonderin when somebodys gonna try to take me off the shelf
but i refuse to be another violent casualty
so when im rollin i pack my pistol grip beside my knee
cause on the city streets today a brother just cant win
when the people you think are your friends really aint your friends
uh and bushwick cant sleep
when everybody around me keeps fallin six feet deep

the pain thats deep inside of everybody grows
as they approach to see the body before the casket close
the person standin next to me has snapped a flick
once i seen the casket closed i knew that that was it
the whole entire family spoke on his defense
the choir sung the songs that make us reminisce
and durin all the singin i broke down myself
when i looked and seen the family that my partner left
and then the choir broke into its final song
thinkin to myself the worst is yet to come
everyone was headed for the final flight
as we creeped along the gravel on the burial site
the director said his words and there was not a sound
as they lowered my little partner towards inside the ground
everybody dropped their flowers on the coffin top
and then they work alone with the concrete block
and thats deep

a lotta homies die a lotta mothers cry
i watch tears fall down from their eyes
everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to take the chance
they chose the music so they had to dance
couldnt tell him nothin was a player had to have it
got caught up in the game now my boys in the casket
and everybodys lookin for somebody else to blame
ashamed to let his mother know that he was in the game
we used to kick it on the ave at night
comin up tryin to have the finer things in life
but now my boys gone i wish he was at home
i wish he wouldnta never fell victim to the chrome
so when i drink a brew for you i pour some on the block son
you might be gone but you damn sure aint forgotten
so long remember whenever or wherever
dead or alive real partners come together
and you know that

and fuckin two of the finest bitches around g
it used to be fun but now its gettin borin to me
constantly fuckin fuckin fuckin fuckin
ridin my dick like a horse buckin buckin
now im gettin that enlightenment in my life
im missin that excitement
thinkin about how these two girls could excite me
then it hit me  both of them liked me
huh haha yeah thats the lick
listen and learn while i kick some more serious shit

diggin deep into my mind you understand
i came up with a dopeass master plan
thinkin while i sip on a forty
i got it imma throw myself a private party

she thought about it and said cool its on
pick me up at eight  then i hung up the phone
i called up the other dropped a little knowhow

then i dropped the second step of my plan
asked her had she ever been with two men or a woman and man
say what its just a question im not out to diss you
she said yeah baby its cool but yo im heterosexual
she was frontin man trust me
cause shes the type of ho who like to taste her own pussy
when were fuckin she takes the dick out licks it all over
then she puts it in her mouth
now after doin that type of shit
she could be talkin the other things real quick
i said i got another friend i wanna party with
and we can all get into the hot tub and have a little bit of fun

consider this a test and if you pass youll be my number one
she said okay its a date
i gotta make a few runs so pick me up at eight
huh better make it eight thirty give me some time to wash up
and take a bath because im kinda dirty
before she hung up the phone i said wait
if you wasnt special to me i wouldnta invited you on the date
she said yeah i know  i love you see you later
things are gettin good but in the end theyll be much greater

pick em up then i make em feel comfortable
crackin jokes as if i was cliff huxtable
get into the crib things are hype
fix em a couple of drinks to get their heads right
but not too much cause i dont wanna make em woozy
thirty minutes later lets jump into the jacuzzi

cause i dont have one either
the shit was gettin dope i had to take a breather
step into the water and its showtime

but i kept my cool grinnin like a devil

living in a world where hearts are cold yea yea yall
living in a city where thugs dont live that long so
sleeping in a home where only gangstas rome all nite long and ah
thuggin there for days wit my gs and we pray help us lord

never confuse luv with lust
retailate bust for bust
you can trust in us we spit that venomous
its either them or us ash to ash sell the dust
we go to war for the peace ignore the police
i still believe that its the east that invented
see the west complemented they always represent it
and all my peoples down south keeps it weed scented
better focus when i put this hocus pocus on the cd
i drop mine in braile so them blind cats can read me
im the cat that curiosity killed prophesy filled
im still water that run deeper than hole pussy
get pushy in the clutch roll up like dutchmadness
i cuts and slashs plus i flows like casius
its warless clashes you need credit in the last days
so when them gats spray do crime pay when you get shot
thats why i stay calm like www dot cd
for who seeks the actual article
you heard it live its certified mechanic on the mother ship
the alien i changed the course of them with the wings
i would love to be considered sin in a physical form
like im born to be crucified and mother was born to cry
taught bitches born to live long and bastards are born to die
and god and the devil just dont see eye to eye
coz yall thugs dont understand that the devil gone always lie

living in a world where hearts are cold yea yeah yall
living in a city where thugs dont live that long so
sleeping in a home where only gangstas rome all nite long and ah
thuggin there for days wit my gs and we pray help us lord
living in a world where hearts are cold yea yeah yall

im sick of playin with lil boys
im tryin to explore more like hot oils and sex toys

youll be leavin and ill be ab libin
and well be singin our damn song
its like the first time we made eachother cum
well be suckin and fuck eachother
taste eachother cum
no soul alive can erase what we done
all our horny sticky memories you are stuck to me permanantly

mmmm this particular song right here is
dedicated to the black woman
and it doesnt pertain to all black women
because some of yall disrespect yallself
because you dont know who you are in the first place
this is out of common respect for all women period
word up like this song yo

yo im quite single and occassionally i mingle
but aside from all the rest she sparks my interest
no maam i dont know you
just offering the common respect i feel i owe you
also some conversation companionship commonground and commonsense
theres no such thing as coincidence in me finding you here
and i really hate screaming in your ear so some other time ok
i waited a day phone rings hello
this is carlito from a couple of days ago you sound tired
forgive me if ive called you too late
but what better time to relate mindstate where could i begin
hasnt anyone ever told you you got beautiful skin
youre more than welcome what do you desire within
i just wanna be theres no need to put titles on you and me
those are limitations living and learning are our only obligations
equality honesty independence intelligence emotion and devotion
humbly seeking to hear god when hes speaking
at one time my mind just couldnt conceive
a woman had to dress a certain way to believe
but in the same breath allow me to say
that if you believed young lady you wouldnt dress that way
and i was attracted to your class i couldnt see all yo ass
and i was very content and you deserved every complement
now remember our indifferences make us the same
you gotta have some game or many of you
wont even be able to take care of yourself uh
and love when i look at you i see my reflection
so i offer my love affection and protection
shawty you dead fine but the bottomline is
youre still my sister
chorus ceelo singing
well i say youre my beginnin my end
youre my sista lover and friend
god is your light from within
it shines through your beautiful skin
what they say bout you aint true
theres no me if there is no you
i hope that you understand
you got to respect yourself before i can

yeah i met you and yall knew saw you again on marietta
downtown atlanta checkin your long legs got me smirkin
fixed me dinner one night candles lit
kinda thought you was slick in the beginnin
but it teurned out you wouldnt lie
looked me in my eye i listened
sucked it up pushed on we made amends both sides clicked
true friends since then years done gon by
brought a baby girl into this world made our parents grandfolks
household with no hope took care of ye you me
when shit got put out on the curb
closer than the skin on the back of my hand
through the thick and thin we can win
beautiful black skin
chorus

no need to compete with the music loud
or stairs cold put on a scale of one to ten you a twelve
i chose her over jail and hell
originally from atl

compatible souls come together under bad weather
to discuss distrust amongst the socalled
good in every woman how i wish this was true
i deal with facts only already done cloned me
why i sang the blues when theres only one god
that watches over our every step i need his help
when im walkin lookin for the right female
i cant tell sometimes
they tell me the devils comin humble in his approach
spontaneous with the game
he caught the naive of a girl fallin for the ok
let the pistol smoke the one you live by
die by examples of how relationships can be

i rolls the dice takin a chance at crappin out
like today boy i lost one of my best hips
natural thick lips no animal fat implants
wide load just started workin at the airport
nineteen years old worth more than her weight in gold
but it was all my fault so dont cry understand
if down the line i want you back and the feelin aint mutual
just promise me youll find a new man  thats bout some business
hope she find what her was lookin for like a dreamto my end
i wanted to be more than friends
beautiful black skin black skin
chorus repeat to end

one day i was with my bredren adar roaming the street
on the main road hungry looking for something to eat
not no burger and no chips shit thats easily digested
its that shit that if you re caught youll be easily arrested
we was on a robbing spree i forgot to mention clayton
was this bredder rolling with us he was scared and it was blatant
he was prang but back to the story adar spotted a man
straight ahead of us in the distance with his wifey holding hands
so we followed them through this little alleyway into the flats
when we thought the time was perfect we crept up and we attacked
i took the first swing unexpected causing panic
we was ruthless causing agony in public it was tragic
me and adar lost the plot acting like we was from hell
beat this bredder to the floor moved his wifey up as well
clayton stood back shaking wishing that hed never came
then from out of nowhere was alicia screaming out my name
she went my school she saw it all and by this time shes crying
and to make it worse im hearing sirens i aint even trying to hang around

i can hear them sirens coming
i can hear them sirens coming

daddy daddy tell us a story

heh heh alright alright alright yall ok
come on yall crowd around daddy now ok cmon
yall just sit there and listen
imma tell you about the mc
and imma tell you about the bootlegger ok
here we go children

it happened at a jam some kid tried to sham on the program
so i had to silence the lamb and show him who i am
so i just set it off on my competitor
freakin the funk as i hit em with crazy metaphors
like back up off me dukes because youre trippin
you better dry your cranium off cause your brain is slippin
you beatin me is somethin that i doubt
the only way you could bake kane is workin in a crackhouse
no man alive can withstand the kane flow
i kick so much flavor that my shoes look like a rainbow
you need a whole lot of practice you thought that you was
on the money so i took you out like taxes
now you can flea off releasin me g easy be
to keep the great mc
then i throw em i lean and mean record to spark
so i can school that ass just like joe clark
next i translated my rap is more educated
and made it complicated for him to illustrate it
my dexterity put him in fear of me
and had his mind bewildered by everything he was hearin see
that was enough to slow his whole train of thought down
so i just speeded the pace up more than enough for him to come around
i triple the words when makin the rhymes whatever the rhythm
puttin his mind in a prison
and oh yeah thats how i did em
thats how i did em huh thats how i did em hah
thats how i did em huh thats how i did em hah
thats how i did em huh thats how i did em hah
thats how i did em heyyyyyyyy

i was out flex lookin cold sex in a lex
sippin on a becks pumpin the remix of das efx
drive down one hundred and twentyfiveth with my man
and what did i see bein sold at the stand
a bunch of bootleg tapes that he had claim on it
so i snatched everything with my name on it
and give me that kool g rap tape and give me that ice cube
and all the wutang joints cause theyre my boys too
a man tryin to make a livin i cant knock it
but now you tried to take money out of my pocket
word to miz what the problem is is that the kids
didnt buy it from the wiz they bought your shaky fibs so
now its time to move him off the block
pass me the glock cause i might make a body rock
and ill break down sixteen shots
thats one  eight  seven on a undercover
bootlegger youre worse than a beggar
makin a fake profit stop it
cause i work hard for the money to make cash flow
to have another come along and take my dough
nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
so i just told my man aiyyo
throw the tapes in the lexus
then we burned his whole stand down just like waco texas
and then i jumped on the brother with rage
crushed his ribcage damn did he get slayed
cause i dont think he even know whatever hit him
bootleggers beware cause yeah i did em
thats how i did em huh thats how i did em hah
thats how i did em huh thats how i did em hah
thats how i did em huh thats how i did em hah
thats how i did em heyyyyyyyy

give it your best shot bring it with all you got
and watch the bombs i drop just rock your knot
cause it aint wise to address me
i wouldnt advise a schoolteacher to test me
cause i dont just do em i run through em
and i dont just hurt uh uh i body work em
lyrical torture never could support ya
for steppin to me agony is what it brought ya
cause you never seen this type of lyrical genius
that could never be touched and i mean this
so one love imma leave you with the rhythm
aint no need to go off cause yo hon know i did em
thats how i did em huh thats how i did em hah
thats how i did em huh thats how i did em hah
thats how i did em huh thats how i did em hah
thats how i did em heyyyyyyyy

here we go here we go on the smooth side
lets take a ride in stride and im the guide
with the source and of course
i dont wanna be the king or boss i just wanna get my point across
cause its time to organize and open your eyes
realize we on the rise
to the climax time to take charge
whoever said we cant live large
to seek out fortune without distortion
and stop livin for just a small portion
there is a move to make we gotta take a chance to break
all chains become awake
cause this is the new way to be proud and brave
and i aint goin out like a slave
in eightynine im livin like a champ
step out my face talkin bout a food stamp
child please put it at ease
freeze its time to get paid in times like these
we cant take shorts or take a loss
so take it from the kane and go for yours because

there comes a time where we cant be in the rear
we gotta step up front to get our share
make the change cause were not inferior
for example there was a black ms america
lets start to do for ourself
we cant depend on no one else or the board of health
so hold your own or else youre gonna find
that if you play off of crime you go out like aunt jemima
we gotta put it in overdrive and strive to survive
to stay alive thats the reason ive
came to motivate us to the length
effort of strength makes you grow inch by inch
takin no mediums or small at all
we gotta walk not crawl or else take a fall
what used to be just hopes and thoughts
are now in effect and we cant take shorts because

swing on that right there pump it up here we go
uhhuh uhhuh pump it up here we go
one more thing

lets unite together we cant sever never
no matter what or whatever
because we need unity to find justice
just i see equality so bust this
take a stand and command to demand whats grand
i know we can if we just understand
the true way of livin that was really meant for us
so one more time kick the chorus

ah keep it goin yall
a prince paul rulin em all yall
a prince paul schoolin em all yall
and tony tony tony tony
and tony tone never leavin the girls alone
tony tone never leavin the girls alone
and you dont stop and you dont stop
and you dont stop and you dont stop

onefiftyeight lewis avenue
between lafayette and van buren that was back during
the days of hangin on my bedstuy block
with spence and mitch followin my cousin murdoch
all the brothers were real goin for what they feel
by the way peace to my man sha and big neal
now in ninetythree im still bein me
you think my fridgerator aint full of olde e  huh
a lot of times i get fly with a suit and a tie
yeah i went from rags to riches but i still rock the saggy britches
and i dont try to act brand new
eatin escargots and usin words like rendezvous
the ghetto life ive seen a lot overcome
make a little money and then forget where they came from
livin a plastic lifestyle youre more false than dentures
dont make me pull your file  stop shammin

stop holdup pause wait twox
stop shammin

so why you wanna be what youre not
and claim to have things that you know you aint got
youre just a fantasizer  spendin all your money
on lusters pink oil moisturizer
just to make your hair curly and thin
you say black is beautiful but then you go and bleach your skin
money youre worse than yacub
cause their are eight stages of graft and you broke down to two
plus you got a bad case of jungle fever
and nmmananahnah i just cant believe ya
its quite obvious you dont wanna be a black man
so whats next  youre gonna join the klu klux klan
you sold out to your race and its a big disgrace
you cant look your own people in the face
you wonder why it aint no black schools or hospitals
youre makin millions of dollars and its pitiful
that you can donate to leukemia all the time
but you cant give the nation of islam a dime
they mention muslims you change the subject
you cant even shake farrakhan hand in public
that whole busy attitude is a sham
umm bro umm brother umm brougham stop shammin

stop holdup pause wait twox
change the groove and fuck it up a little bit

i look in the mirror at times i say damn black caesar
howd you get to be the woman pleaser
cause i remember when girls didnt notice me
and now they wanna come and talk to me like jodeci
its strange how back in the days i couldnt get with em
now all of a sudden the honies they wanna give me rhythm
well ima hit it but still i show no pity
so i hope you dont think you gonna be in my next video
and many brothers i never even ran with
be actin like they been hangin with me since i was a kid
i mean just to get a piece of the action
man they start rememberin more times than michael jackson
but i cant fade to the tagalongs
that want me to drag em on
frontin like a friend just so i can put em in
but you cuttin yourself paper thin  stop shammin

stop holdup pause wait twox

now theres this girl named monique
the type of female that you consider a freak
a bigtime player playin like a drum beat
you think her address is twentyone hump street
she step out every night to swing
with her lee pressons and a nefertiti ring
bamboo earrings all big and lookin silly
with extensions hangin down like milli vanilli
and every wednesday night at the apollo
first kid she saw with jewerly shed follow
and monique would be ready to sleep
with the first kid in a benz or a cherokee jeep
strung out and givin up the nappy dug out
youre on the critical list about to pull the plug out
so here nympho heres some good info
stop takin em putts and close your legs toots
cause i remember you was one of a kind and a fine  hm
i once was infatuated by the things that you do
but now youre doodoo
its all about respectin yourself
in order to gain respect from anyone else
treat yourself like a real woman should
cause bitch you aint no damn good

well now heres another story
about this kid by the name of corey
a hustler with game tryin to make a name
that was his aim but his lifestyle was lame
cause he would front like it wasnt even funny
about his girl his car and his money
pullin out a knot every place
but every single bill had washingtons face
and he went beyond exaggeration
to lie about his means of transportation
because he said he had a benz car
come to find out it was his friends car
talk about simple chronic halitosis
damn his breath was ferocious
he had an odor that just wont quit
smelled like he washed in oil of oh shit
tellin girls hes daddy longstrokin
shit you must be jokin
cause he aint got no bitches
and couldnt hurt a virgin if her pussy had stitches
see corey theres a lot youre missin
seems to me you aint got a pot to piss in
so lets get one thing understood
muthafucka you aint no damn good
prince paul
the moral of the story is
the majority of the population of males and females today
are just no damn good

dearly beloved we are gathered here today for this somber occasion please join us in the mourning of this ufortyseven it was a great microphone in its day until it met its fate one evening while it was in the studio
it was struck by the lyrical force of the big daddy kane so ashes to ashes and dust to dust may this microphone rest in peace

knock knock guess who yes ooh
the bigger the b the iggah the i the jigga the g is comin through
yes im the one with clout theyre all talkin bout
to be frank i have the flavor like sauerkraut
the microphone assassinator and furthermore
i murdered plenty rappers and believe that ill murder more
so if you ask to give the kane a go
you better treat me like drugs and just say no
because i utilize my skills to brutalize
and in a battle man you should see what i do to guys
whenever the mics mine ill rock a hype rhyme
and come off like dirty panties at nighttime
cause any mic that i caress i finesse
with zest and just bless best yet to progress
king asiatic no other rapper stands this
you couldnt be a king if you played hockey in los angeles
i gets pidaid top gridade gotta admiteh
point blank the kids stridaight
cause when it comes to rappin huh
i got it locked up like a bullpen

may you rest in peace
may you rest in peace
may you rest in peace
if this meaning doesnt manifest put it to rest

rappers i get em and hit em and slit em and split em and rid em
acquit em when i get with em you can tell that i did em
i take em and shake em and bake em and ache em and break em
and rake em you cant awake em from the comatose way i make em
cause when youre messin with me you know what
you can swallow a live grenade and you still wont blow up
pickin up the microphone you shouldnt dare
its like being on a stairmaster climbin and goin nowhere
youre perpetratin like youre ready and able
but couldnt rock a show if the stage was a cradle
your rhymes are old as an artifact and you dont want no part of that
so dont even start it black
anyone riffin i show them how im livin
and give them some of that treatment like my man michael bivins
i smack em up flip em and then shove em down
huh oh iahahiahiahi dont be fuckin around
to rip this microphone like this today
since eightyseven i came a long long way
to headlinin all the way from supportin
and i know youve been watchin me norton
through my whole rap career a lot of young huh
rappers sat there and listened a lot of young huh
rappers sat there and wishin but
you couldnt see the kane with xray vision
and just because you didnt see my crew for a few
a lot of people thought the wolfpack was through
but if you think the kane and scoob and scrapll breakup
i tell you like marvin gaye wake up wake up wake up
put it to rest its best to fess
because the kane is breakin rappers like the irs
and consider this microphone the deceased
now may it rest in peace

may you rest in peace
may you rest in peace
may you rest in peace
may you rest in peace
may you rest in peace
may you rest in peace
may you rest in peace

and there was no way we thought
wed go to jail for ery case we caught
for all the yay we bought not a dime did we say we borrowed

since our stacks is the largest didnt take us long to corner the market
i remember every day was a party
fifteen sixteen was dreams of bein cocaine bosses
in pursuit of that we made so many terrible choices
like the time we made away with that millenium
from the dealership before our day wasnt we killin them
late nights gun fights high speed chases
so close to the good life we tasted
damn the consequences pimp if its a chance wed take it
first case a month in juvenile and get probation
when i think about all we done
its amazin to see how far weve come

slave for the next man who raised nigga fuck you
these streets are ninetofive you want it we can get it for ya
and even though they steady changin this is still a hustle

the same integrity we upheld in the street light
livin a motherfuckin dream nigga singin like
 w scarface ad libs

hey have you ever loved somebody so much you cant stand it but cant do without em
do anything for em cause you truly do adore em
like dedicate songs write poems
but they be on that bullshit and you try to ignore em
but you feel like they feel like you aint right for em
therefore your hearts torn
between bein with em forever leavin em never
but it seem like you arguin fightin over whatever
maybe we can leave find someone better
even though you know youve never known none better
my heart say nah she cant leave wont let her
been head over heels since the very day i met her
fell so deep in love i aint been able to get up
sometimes i want some peace of mind and she wont shut up
love her to death dont know whether to kiss her or kill her

shouldve known it
from the start it was already over
we were just too dumb to notice
and wed pray but
even love couldnt save us
wed wake up
on a bed of guns and roses
and we dont know which one to choose
when either way were gonna lose
still wed pray but
even love couldnt save us
wed wake up
on a bed of guns and roses

i guess id rather suffer with her than be miserable without her
i buy a lot of prada gucci and balenciaga
to keep her content and keep down the nonsense
but every corner we turn arounds a conflict
mostly dumb shit like who she run with
where the fuck you been your pants  they dont fit
really honestly speaking some things i dont get
no matter how much she try she cant make it make more sense
therefore here we go again
screamin yellin at the top of our lungs she goin in
saying the kind of shit i be like if you was a man
i would go in your shit for real no shit
but i love her so much that i cant forget
that the feel of a kiss it could heal when im sick
still i dont like to feel like this
if i didnt miss her i would try to get her killed right quick

shouldve known it
from the start it was already over
we were just too dumb to notice
and wed pray but
even love couldnt save us
wed wake up
on a bed of guns and roses
and we dont know which one to choose
when either way were gonna lose
still wed pray but
even love couldnt save us
wed wake up
on a bed of guns and roses

every time we say our goodbyes
a little piece of my heart breaks off inside
i dont really ever know why
if i could live without you id try

shouldve known it
from the start it was already over
we were just too dumb to notice
and wed pray but
even love couldnt save us
wed wake up
on a bed of guns and roses
and we dont know which one to choose
when either way were gonna lose
still wed pray but
even love couldnt save us
wed wake up
on a bed of guns and roses

and killin us no consequences convictions you serious
lyin about what you show in the media

then go and reward all the ones who mistreat us
and leave us in projects and give us these poisonous products
on top of narcotics to push to our sisters and brothers
like them aint our sisters and brothers

turnin them profits to loss when we wont go shop in the mall
united we all stuck in this bullshit together
showin these folk we just wont take whatever

the president woke and he called the pope
the pope climbed to heaven on a golden rope
he asked the lord to raise michaelangelo from the dead
so he can make a fresh painting of my head
then i hung out with a king and a queen
and the queen put me down with her polo team
the way i scored points all around the clock
i had her daughter the princess ridin my jock
i knocked the freak off like a crazy retard
then i took a little trip into a deck of cards
the diamond jack joker and the ace of spades
was amazed at greater cut creator on the fade
then i played cards with the queen of clubs
the queen of hearts with me cold fell in love
as for the queen of diamonds she dont like men
because you know that a diamond is a girls best friend
the doubletrouble spade was named the deuce
and the joker acted stupid so we gave him the noose
there was fiftytwo cards and i met every one
that story is over but my rhyme aint done

then i took a trip to the center of the earth
i was kinda scared so elove went first
i met these funny little people they called em skeezers
so i held on to my wallet like ebeneezer
tight leather pants thatll make you grunt
two nice soft things right up front
the center of the earth aint got no crime
just people bodyrockin to the ll rhyme
if youre kinda confused to what a skeezer is
its just a girl whos on my jock cause im in showbiz
there was a whole lotta skeezers i dogged every one
that story is over but my rhyme aint done

woke up late one afternoon

heman told me hed beat me up
because he thought that i looked like donald duck
then i hung out with spiderman
he told me he was gonna start a comic strip band
the incredible hulk was gonna play the drums
charlie brown grabbed the guitar and started to strum
snoopy tried to rock on the microphone
but tom  jerry both said he should leave it alone
then i hung out with mickey mouse
he had two freaks so we went to his house
mickeys freak was ugly but mine was def
so i knocked it off until there wasnt none left
they were cartoon characters i met every one
that story is over but my rhyme aint done

since im a good friend of father time
im not gettin older as i say this rhyme
i was warmin the stove at the alamo
before booth shot lincoln i stole the show
i was down with george at the delaware
but i wore a kangol not the fake white hair
me and elove met sitting bull
we made a peace pipe then we took a pull
then he brought more leaves from a golden chest
you thought it was tabacco  the shit was cess
there was a lotta great men and i met every one
that story is over but my rhyme aint done

one thousand one hundred and thirtythree i swear its no sooner
i went inside my tv i met the honeymooners
ralph wanted me to bust a couple of rhymes
but i had my eyes on alices behind
norton came down right about that time
lookin in the fridge so he could swine and dine
then i said to myself i should give em a taste
so i pulled the microphone out my black briefcase
said it aint bob hope or barry manilow
then i borrowed nortons hat cause i forgot my kangol
ralph said i got a scheme let me get to it
norton my pal i said yo dont even do it
they were all honeymooners and i met every one
that story is over but my rhyme aint done

cause my tongue cuts sharp i hit a note like a harp
or a harmonica veronica i do my part

chilled in mauiwaui and i carry a harpoon

i searched for other ways made love in caves
and i kicked the ill beats that make the natives raise

from farmers boulevard in st albans queens
theres a lyrical technician who came to play
number one bboy ll cool j
all of this is just a story that i made up

youre turning me on keep me standing up
i wish that i could prove to you that im man enough
i come up to your job and handcuff your boss
throw that nigga in the closet and turn the lights off
then sit you up on the copy machine

then ill take you to the window so the world can see
baby im down on my knees let your world be free
pearl tongue come get up on this desk with me
multiple orgasms is your destiny
wet dream ride like youre going to queens
like i just gave you fifty thou and ya just turned eighteen

youre wearing a plad skirt and long white socks
the vibe is thick baby we both red hot
i kiss your neck unbutton your blouse
let my fingers make circles on the edge of your mouth
your apples so ripe im your tutor for life
got your beggin me to put you on detention tonight
you could read the iliad and the whole odyssey
but no trojan soldier scold you like me
match the calculus then measure my frequency
but when you blast on my lap thats the highest degree
put your hands on the chalkboard scratch it with ya nails
give me goose pimples when ya put yo tounge on my dimples
baby feel me now you got yo ass suspended
got a letter for your parents but i didnt wanna send it
i stopped by the crib you invited me in
you convinced me somehow to sip some juice and gin
then you take me to your parents room and laid me on my back
you twisting kissing ya fist like that
rubber meets the road till the tire goes flat
i filled it up with air again baby hold that
you a bad girl look you got your sheets all wet
squeeze tight so i never forget the teachers pet

ima get you for your paper

imagine that
make you trick on me around the world

we tongue kiss deep in front of the whole crowd
the lights start to flash the music is too loud
we hit the back door and jump in the limousine

she had a fourleaf clover with a big gold chain
she had a salary that was full of calories for real
and i was in the mood for a homecooked meal
so we went to be alone
but we had to be quiet cause her corn pops was home
kissed her neck kissed her back kissed her arms
i said forget it let me see your lucky charms
when we began her hairstyle was neat
but when i left the next morning it looked like shredded wheat
talked about marriage i said thats risky
besides its such a waste of rice krispies
she had a robe with the velours material
her pops woke up i said hello mr cereal

we called him hungry jack
he talked like pops and then he dressed like the mack

they said the second record can be tricky
well thats kind of funny cause i am not trippin
my fansthey know what it is and they with me
yeah i aint the type thats gon ride with the semi
i came from a town with three lights and no city
ive been doing shows for nothin but pennies
when i leave the stage they never forget me
mansion was a glimpse of my life
i let you see what its like to be in my head
people ask me what i think i think id be doin
if it wasnt music id rather be dead agh
you heard what i said that was like me at a three
you dont wanna see me at ten
or maybe you do
i promise if that is the case then that is what yall gonna get
if youre looking for music with watered down lyrics
i promise that you need to go somewhere else
and if you want somebody to tell you everything
that you wanna hear i wont be any help
this flow is familiar i think i heard it before
yeah i made it myself
i left the door open to come in my mansion
but i never said its a beautiful house
some of yall sat on the porch
looked at my windows and stared at my door
they ask me if im gonna kill it this record
i laugh in their face and i ask em do you see the blood on the floors
hes at it again
nf is crazy hes bad for the kids
he never talks about nothing but him
and my friends say hes kind of a diva
well you need to get some new friends
im as chill as it gets
til i get on the stage and flip on the switch
and i go to a place where nobody is
if you bring up my name in a song thats something that you will regret
learned a lot in a year
i remember the shows when no one was there
i remember the shows when nobody cared
some people in front of me laughing like he isnt going nowhere
its funny now isnt it
this type of life isnt how i envisioned it
this type of life it just aint how i pictured it
im in the back of the tour bus
tryin to facetime my family its different
not what you think it is
write a review tell me what you think of this
give me three stars and call me an idiot
but to be honest it dont make a difference
i know some people dont get it
but you have now entered a therapy session
if you dont like music thats personal
i have no clue what you people are doin here might as well throw out the record
i pull up a chair i talk to my music like nobodys there
only person i judge is the one in the mirror
and lately he aint doin well
i dont need yall in my ear
im tired of hearin it
you call it music i call her my therapist
she keep on telling me i have been carryin
way too much baggage i need to take care of it
i know shes right but man its embarrassing
music has raised me more than my parent did
take out a picture of us and i stare at it
who am i kiddin you probably aint hearin this
show me an artist you wanna compare me with
you put us both on a track ima bury em
give me the shovel its bout to get scarier
none of you want it with rap who you staring at
i see you got beats but where is the lyrics at
nf is the logo you know ive been wearin that
dont come to my show and be sittin that very back
i call you out in the crowd like there he is
thought id be happy it feels like im cursed
its hard to be clean when you play in the dirt
you gave me this place to go when im hurtin
i thought itd get better but its getting worse
and i got nobody to blame when i work
like two hundred and fortyseven i aint been to church
and satan keep callin me he tryna flirt
i hang up the phone these are more than just words
i drive on that highway and listen to mansion
i look up to god like when did this happen
yellin with all of my fans to wake up
but feel like i havent
i get emotional i didnt plan this
im doing things i never imagined
im sorry but i gotta leave
i dont wanna be late for my therapy session agh

this thing called love can be so cold
it can be miserable or it can be beautiful
this thing called love can be so cold
sometimes its amazing sometimes its crazy
this thing called love

check check ayy listen
yo love is like a drug that everybody uses
you wanna know the outcomedepends on how you use it
love could be your best friend love could be your enemy
love could be the thing you wish you had but you dont ever see
and love can be the reason why youre afraid to have it
some say it like it means something others its a habit
and some would say its tragic and some would say its beautiful
some would say its black and its dark like a funeral
and some would die for it some dont think its even real
some say they understand but really dont know how it feels
some say that its alive some say that it can kill
but most of us that been in it know that sometimes it will
i aint gonna sugarcoat it yet sometimes it might surround you
one minute its savin you next its tryin to drown you
some people want to show it but were never taught how to
and some of us is searchin feelin like it never found you

this thing called love can be so cold
it can be miserable or it can be beautiful
this thing called love can be so cold
sometimes its amazing sometimes its crazy
this thing called love

yo love is like a privilege a lot of us abuse it
do with it what we want and then start drama when we lose it
pretend like it aint nothing to us pretend that its useless
and we dont know why we do this but yet we still pursue it
and love it can consume you turn you into something else
bury the real you so deep that you cant even find yourself
love it can change you love it can tear you down
be the best thing you ever had and kick you on the ground
yo you get on that high level yet you scared to fall
cause you know if that person hurts you you gon lose it all
they told you they would be there for you they dont even call
so that openness you used to have has now become a wall
and some say that its patient some say that its kind
i dont think its invisible but i know that its blind
to some its only physical or all up in their mind
see it probably isnt there if youre strugglin to find it

this thing called love can be so cold
it can be miserable or it can be beautiful
this thing called love can be so cold
sometimes its amazing sometimes its crazy
this thing called love

this love has got me down low now i guess im up high
one minute im on the ground next minute im in the sky
i feel invincible and so unrejected
forget it im invisible and i feel unprotected
yo i dont need nobody else trust me im fine
i cant do this by myself im losing my mind
yeah i can see clearly forget it im blind
my heart says danger cant you read the signs
yo but through all the pain i swear i love it
no matter what you do it dont disappear does it
yo id rather spend a minute with love in my life
than go a million years without knowing what its like
you better grab it you dont wanna lose it
and yeah it brings pain its insane but the bruises
my god can take that all away youll find that right person
and everything you thought that wasnt becomes worth it

this thing called love can be so cold
it can be miserable or it can be beautiful
this thing called love can be so cold
sometimes its amazing sometimes its crazy
this thing called love

im cold yeah

i aint here to argue about his facial features
or here to convert atheists into believers
im just tryna say the way school need teachers
the way kathie lee needed regis thats the way i need jesus
so here go my single dawg radio needs this
they say you can rap about anything except for jesus
that means guns sex lies videotape
but if i talk about god my record wont get played huh
well if this take away from my spins
whichll probably take away from my ends
then i hope this take away from my sins
and bring the day that im dreamin about
next time im in the club everybody screamin out

jesus walk
god show me the way because the devils tryna break me down
jesus walk with me
the only thing that i pray is that my feet dont fail me now

yeah
they say home is where the hate is my dome is where fate is
i stroll where souls get lost like vegas
seen through the eyes of rebel glasses
pray to god that my arms reach the masses
the young smoke grass in grassless jungles
rubber band together in cashless bundles
we wear strugglin chains divided only hustle remains
makin sense of it we hustle for change
revolution aint a game its another name for life fightin
someone to stay in they corner like mike tyson
hypes fightin for hits to heighten they hell
dont he know he could only get as high as he fell
show money becomes bail relationships become jail
children are unheld
i wish love was for sale behold the pale  horse
got me trapped like r kel i bail and it 

might not be such a bad idea if i never
never went home again
im on my way home
i left three days ago but no one seems to know im gone
home is where the hatred is home is filled with pain and it
might not be such a bad idea if i never
never went home again

the rings all ringed out
burn out cave in
blackened to dark out
im mixed now fleshed out
theres light with no heat

beyond the truest hey teacher teacher
tell me how do you respond to students
and refresh the page and restart the memory
respark the soul and rebuild the energy
we stopped the ignorance we killed the enemies
sorry for the night demons that still visit me
the plan was to drink until the pain over
but whats worse the pain or the hangover
fresh air rollin down the window
too many urkels on your team thats why your wins low
dont make me pull the toys out huh
dont make me pull the toys
and fire up the engines huh
and then they make noise

can we get much higher so high
oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh

at the mall there was a seance
just kids no parents
then the sky filled with herons

swing out of your shoes
and if you should lose this time
keep on swinging and swinging and soon
when you connect
with all of your strength
look up and you might see a dent in the moon

yeah you see them craters
that was cause a kid said thered be none greater
in ten years hammering hank was at the plate launching balls into space saying see ya later
skinny as a toothpick but he got a knack
watch him swing a broomstick at a bottlecap
watch him rinse and repeat till hes on the map
going from the cheap seats to the autographs
papa put a bat in my hand and all he said was never ever ever ever rock a dodger hat
and whether you win or you didnt you gotta be getting dirty
and we better send your jersey to the laundromat
it was in the cards
i knew someday id be a big league star
playing second base for the giants wearing number nine rocking kneehigh socks
if i just worked hard

swing out of your shoes
and if you should lose this time
keep on swinging and swinging and soon
when you connect
with all of your strength
look up and you might see a dent in the moon

we had our sixth grade baseball tryouts on the basketball courts
so a fastballhad hops
we didnt have a grass field and so coach hit us grounders
off the asphalti dropped
a lot and so he hit em faster and i took em off my ankles
yelling thats all you got
and when i saw my name on the roster i went insane
like i was sniffing bath salts im nothere to play soft
ill go beastmode on a piñata and bite its motherfucking face off
until it rains candy out of its neckhole
i dont go flexing my pecs or get swole
i wasnt the fastest
and when i moved it kinda looked like i was running through molassestrue
its silly to give a shit about a game but earth
is a little ball thats spinning on its axistoo

swing out of your shoes
and if you should lose this time
keep on swinging and swinging and soon
when you connect
with all of your strength
look up and you might see a dent in the moon

i wasnt cut out for the bigs guess i been a fool
and middle school was just a bit of cruel ridicule
but when you step into the ranks of the man
its like they push you from the high dive to the kiddie pool thanks
its time to ballroom waltz that plank
were little minnows in a small shark tank
you try to swim without getting blood in the water
but youre all heart and guts like a ballpark frank
never an allstar
i had to keep score
if i were perfect i would quit and join the peace corps
im not a hero if i didnt try my doubts eat at me
like im a carcass on the sea floor
so say this shit is too corny
it tastes better to me than ooh poor me
im just trying to sing a different tune
and then fit into a world that didnt have room for me

swing out of your shoes
and if you should lose this time
keep on swinging and swinging and soon
when you connect
with all of your strength
look up and you might see a dent in the moon
swing out of your shoes
and if you should lose this time
keep on swinging and swinging and soon
when you connect
with all of your strength
look up and you might see a dent in the moon

some got hits about the racks that they earn
say theres benjamins and jacksons in their pockets to burn
but when they shoot the video producers pass around a bucket
full of rented jewelry for them to rock and return
i know a straight edge rapper who acts like a sheep herder
a vegan on the mic whose screaming that meats murder
but when everybodys sleeping he be creeping
slugging back the whiskey
hating himself and sneaking a cheeseburger
theres a pop idol at the top of the charts
and when her records being cut shes on the beach in st barts
while a session singer who didnt have the face to make it
signs a nondisclosure agreement and belts out her parts
its hard cause i got bars that are big uppin woody allen
but maybe hes a predator whose diggin in his talons
theres a balance and often i dont know how to feel
in a fake and tainted world seek the real

now i cant change the past but a mans gotta man up
its hard to believe sometimes i get the best of me
now im doing what i can but im a man not a damn chump
i can say it if you need but id rather let the ink bleed

we dismiss our heroes skeletons no matter how grim
my fans saying id be honored to be injured by him
well fam this branch is thin but ill go out on a limb
to say she didnt love her ulna poking out of her skin
being pumped full of morphine and tied to machines
they cut off my jeans i heard her in the ambulance scream
shes in school to do tattoos and mighta had nerve damage
so i could have cost a girl a chance at her dream
meanwhile he pops painkillers until the dude is numb
knew i was a stupidass just not that im a ruthless one
youth is easily influenced
so should you be rooting for me if i touch a thousand lives
but on the way i ruin some
the rule of thumb is all publicity is your advantage
but human lives are not collateral damage
bandage the wounded then vanish
blank as the newest of canvases
when they zoom in the cameras give them the truth

now i cant change the past but a mans gotta man up
its hard to believe sometimes i get the best of me
now im doing what i can but im a man not a damn chump
i can say it if you need but id rather let the ink bleed

megachurch leaders sleeping with male hookers
mayors hitting crack pipes with their cookers
each week a crooked politician gets caught
were not shocked when theyre cheaters
these days were shocked when theyre not
are they the person you thought if theyre perfect and hot
often we blame the victim scoff
and they deserve what they got
actors sweep it under the rug and resume with the plot
but theyre amateurs and we can see the boom in the shot
if perception is reality then this could be a shocker
ive done my share of fucked up things that didnt get on gawker
lots of tiny indiscretions way beyond the public eye
that if you saw would probably out me as a complicated guy
mike says you got to separate the person from the art
but if the arts about that person you cant pull them apart
so you better watch the choices that youre making now because
they arent something that matter theyre the only thing that does

everything they say conflicts with everything i do
but i must admit i did it so i guess it might be true
everything they say conflicts with everything i do
but i must admit i did it so i guess it might be true
everything they say conflicts with everything i do
but i must admit i did it so i guess it might be true
everything they say conflicts with everything i do
but i must admit i did it so i guess it might be true

she freaked when she saw me
calmly eating my tamale
she followed me home from the diner
now all day she be on me
on the other side of the street
you can see her through the blinds if you peek
with a book propped up on her knees and the blue hair
what do you care when im home what i do there
youre creeping out my neighbors
when they grab the paper
you probably think im inside
like some kind of savior
solving world hunger
working on sudoku
and filling in the numbers
polishing my halo
ooh i bet you wonder
life can be bogus
we all wanna be noticed
but were the ones in the background fuzzy
when the ones in the front are in focus
and its pretty difficult in general
when you really think a person is incredible
and i get it why youre setting em up on a pillar
but the bigger the tumble the bigger the pedestal
frankly i am flattered
we all want to matter
do you see when you pass by
that we let the grass die
im late with the rent check
we park on the lawn
like were a bunch of fuckin rednecks
im just watching netflix
jerking off to porno
i have a subscription
and i got a suspicion
you think my life is different
i get your confusion
but you got some delusions
yeah im fucking awesome
but i gotta out you
you probably think im in there
writing songs about you ooooh

were summoning spirits
tearing the labels
clearer than vodka
bottle it up
dont bottle it up

has anybody told you youre a mean ass drunk
has anybody told you youre a mean ass drunk
has anybody told you youre a mean ass drunk
oh no oh shit oh no oh shit oh no no no no

you say its your thing to be honest
like its kind of this token of pride
well to be honest youre kind of a goddess
but being with you kind of kills me inside
you want me to explain it well
its sort of this look in your eye
like youre cooking an egg on the hood of your car cause you looked at it hard
but my heart is the egg and youre watching it fry
im not gonna cry im not gonna lie i am gonna cry
but not right here
give me like a minute let me get up in my feelings while i pop my beer
shit is getting muddy and im seeking out the buddy
at the bottom of the bottle but its not quite clear
what you expect from me
when youre disrespecting me

has anybody told you youre a mean ass drunk
has anybody told you youre a mean ass drunk
has anybody told you youre a mean ass drunk
oh no oh shit oh no oh shit oh no no no no

wanna treat me like a dog on a leash
well thats your prerogative sheesh
or does she wanna see what we got
when the saga repeats nada capeesh
im not a complete wretch
i fetch i sit a bit but im not gonna stay
but if you wanna see me you can see my feets
and my cute little cheeks when im walkin away
you can see me sitting on the dock at the bay
you can see me lickin on my crotch like a stray
but if youre gonna see me like a prop in a play
gotta say ill be skippin what you got for the day
maybe youll be thinking that im hot in the head
or im sick of pickin at my chicken pox in the bed
you can think what you like i think ill take a hike

oh no oh no oh shit oh shit
oh no oh no oh shit oh shit
its just one small complaint i know i am no saint
oh no oh no oh shit oh shit
oh no oh no oh shit
i think were old enough to know what we aint

were summoning spirits
drink it in drink it in spit it out spit it out spit it out spit it out spit that shit out
tearing the labels
take it off take em off take em off get it on get it on get this shit on
clearer than vodka
get em up sit em up sit em up sit em up put em down put em down put em down put that shit down

has anybody told you youre a mean ass drunk another one lets have another
has anybody told you youre a mean ass drunk another one cmon another one
has anybody told you youre a mean ass drunk another one why not another one

another one
has anybody told you youre a mean ass drunk

took chances slow dance with the devil bitch
overcomin the circumstances we hella rich

freedom or big chains they dont feel my pain

they dont feel my pain
theyll never feel my pain
and theyll never play this shit on the radio

i still picture your affection
i still hear you like were talkin on the phone
i still feel it
like youre right there holdin on to me
but words cannot explain
we will never be us again
everything has changed
or is that just you givin up again
more unnecessary pain

i would ask how we ended up here but i drove
and you allowed me
or maybe its only me that remembers it
cause youre so easily told about me
but not once while we were on that road did you doubt me
played your position writin out our books
i noticed a page missin blame it on the age difference
i see you in the club now days youre resistant
you used to get excited just to never pay admission
lookin for the old you wishin shit was normal
tried to mold you and you ended up with it on you
live around the corner yeah we aint even formal
so im askin god why you alive and i gotta mourn you
word i see you got a little crew now
a bunch of ugly broke bitches i know better than
and i aint tryna say them hoes usin you
well actually who would i be kiddin yes i am
i see your life from far and somethings off with it
its my fault and shit i shoulda never altered it
i sold a dream when you couldnt have known the cost of it
knew my love came with a pain and i still offered it
seein your weight loss knowin im the cause of it
if that aint my signature then shit somebody forgin it
but you think i aint hurt like it aint no guilt in me
like it aint killin me im out here on a killin spree
a sickness i aint found a way to nurse it yet
like i aint a nervous wreck like its no reverse effect
internal bleedin and the cuts run deep
every time i leave one love a loved one leaves
i wish i could take the pain away but only yours
ill be fine if i remain this way
see i deserve whatever punishment i get
you could sentence me to years
of hearin my vics voice even when nothin is there

i still picture your affection
i still hear you like were talkin on the phone
still feel it
like youre right there holdin on to me
but words cannot explain
we will never be us again
everything has changed
or is that just you givin up again
more unnecessary pain

i done gone so long not givin a fuck
that its no longer erratic now its a normal habit
even when i go my way i gotta have it
bury me with my sweats on and bitches in the casket
all the waiters and words i let em loom on
every verse real enough to write it on my tombstone
and so you know how real that paranoia be
even make me think my demise is avoidin me
the sick part is i withstand that abuse
long as the fans are amused am i a man or a muse
never sugarcoat it when i hand it to the youth
fell from all over the world and always landed in the booth
i hold music in such a high regard that
to this day i still feel like its destiny
and to these fans that i once gave my life for
i gotta tell you that its not much left in me
yeah and not that its growin old
but years of bearin my soul is takin its toll
took a father from his son but is it best that way
im so fucked up inside i cant regret that trey
hold my head up high at the gates after my times up
they say you saved somebodys life by givin mine up
wouldnt be the first time that i went without
chased my true love so much that i resent it now
you can put this in the scriptures like its sacred
to live with it but hate it is to giveth then to take it
goin through the motions itll strip a nigga naked
i guess its for a cause if all the kids are gonna play it
trust me i aint been the same yet
youll stop and stare any time you see a trainwreck
and ill take whatever punishment they give
you can sentence me to years
of hearin that fans voice even when nothin is there

i still picture your affection
i still hear you like were talkin on the phone
still feel it
like youre right there holdin on to me
but words cannot explain
we will never be us again
everything has changed
or is that just you givin up again
more unnecessary pain

still learnin to live with
people coming in and out my life
the ones who matter show it over time
thats why they always stay on my mind
so i live in reality
nobody else matters to me but you you you
why try to hide the truth

i still picture your affection
i still hear you like were talkin on the phone
still feel it
like youre right there holdin on to me
but words cannot explain
we will never be us again
everything has changed
or is that just you givin up again
more unnecessary pain
im tried of feeling this
i gotta live with this

not too good joe not too good  i tell it like it is nothin i can do about it
so whos runnin the poker games
i dont know  did a good job and hes retired i dont have the game i used to have  uncle 
you cant you cant give up you cant give up poker

just tryna explain the unexplainable
more than tryna attain the unattainable try and make it sustainable
collectin all the parts see if they interchangeable
killin me slow but im glad its entertainin you
everyday it amaze me
the same thinkin that pay me the same thinkin that plagues me
how can i think im crazy sway me
cause to profit off of shit that aches me is actually pretty wavy
uh im paintin the perfect picture
only perfect cause the imperfections are highlighted
to gross currency off of that kinda sickness
changes the meaning of mind my business
givin what was given to me
so the soldiers come over unsober and call me yoda instead of joseph
i be like why they come to me for advice
they should really come to me for a vice i got em all
got a counter full of liquor pocket full of pills
the illusion of control i can tell you how it feels
accounts full of paper and the women i play wit
all got criminal bodies innocent faces
come around and we have a ball could have it all
well i ran out of adderall but thats a matter of a call check it
odds is they start tellin me they hardships
regardless they end up wantin hard dick aww shit
you would think theyd been ordained
got her legs in the air she screamin the lords name
im feedin her more game more game more game
i started fuckin her mind thats when all them thoughts came
she keep sayin if i want her i should fight for her
my plight for her says i dont know if im right for her
even so know theres a fire i ignite for her
starin at her ceiling seeing me like im a nightcrawler
uh its like she love me but she dont word
thats when she lose me thats when she confuse me
its what i get appalled wit cant call it
she think i should remove her hurt since i installed it
but i wish she knew i was perturbed too
birds view it hurt me more knowin i hurt you
even though it exists i dont ever bring it up
we dont be doin nothin but its everything to us
presently she bring up the past and its filthy
you not talkin to who i was or who i will be
but thats my own assignment
you wanna take all the feelings and the time spent and give it realignment
check the catalog lateral god
i selfsabotage id explain further but id rather not talk to em
salute on me everybody have a shot
i do it for the niggas they said wouldnt have a shot
but some days are better than some days
still yet here i stand on numb legs
women dont give a fuck that i have these scars
im fuckin the same hoes that the athletes are
what a rollercoaster we argued and we sexed uh
face in her box james harden in her texts
nigga from the clippers ery mornin text her good mornin
she be sleep he just be talkin to me my nigga
none of this is a pain to see
i only care about her if she pertains to me
shit im tendin to emergencies with urgency
that urge in me is my daily fight in her purgin me
fuck hoes i aint got time to be sprung now
grandpas cancer just made it to his lungs now
in two thousand and twelve docs gave him few months wild
hes alive somehow outlived two sons wow
so now their observation
says hell die quicker with chemo and radiation
he aint strong enough to even go through operation
know that deaths comin he just in the house waitin
so you tellin me there aint a way to fix the shit
or is grandpa too old for you to give a shit
lets switch the shit give you my predicament
wonder how you would feel if i was tellin yours live with it
and its travelin to his heart soon
of course it all hit me like a harpoon
i was in shock and then it was all clearer
when he called me and asked me to be his pallbearer
i was floored
but then the next second was back to being selfcentered selfabsorbed
and it became about me fought it off long enough
i could help carry your weight but i aint strong enough
but why do i have to be
this the shit i be naturally askin me im such a catastrophe
see me breakin down with my father in back of me
so for me to attend im tryna think of a strategy
but im happy for my dad why
he was incarcerated when his mama didnt make it
so for him to get that chance again witchu
means the world he could be there til it end for you
and me what i bleed out through this pen for you
cant carry this around gotta vent its due
cause now grandpall be closer to his wife
have cards when i come we playin poker in the sky

youyoull get it back
 would you like to be a pallbearer thats something to think about yeah im not  good to hear from you anyway take care
all right you know ill see you soon grandad
oh okay bye

yall dont know me
honestly i cant say that i blame yall
i dont even really know myself
but yall probably shouldnt know me

last thing im tryna be is the good guy now
i aint never gave a fuck why should i now
like the worlds interrupting my song with an interlude
cant yall see im busy trying to balance out my chemical
finishing up what yall aint even begin to do
when your backs against the ropes its either him or you
yall aint so important that my words are meant for you
when did eybody become so sensual
caught up in the hesay shesay blog sites
him and her broke up worldstar nahright
dumb fans they believe everything that yall write
found out friends fake couldnt even facade right
pressures on wont fail nigga got too much to prove
wouldve been lost it but i got too much to lose
say what you want about joe but i stood my ground
bitch i get it up myself you just put it down
they say i put my whole life on display to my dismay
stop it youre carrying on without logic
let me tell you this about joe
i only say what i want you to hear
youll only see what i want to show
crushing up the percocet chasing the high talli
i couldnt make this shit up if i tried
the forecast shows a downpour
yall just made god cry praying for my downfall

this shit im talking bout right here
let me tell you niggas something
you can be anything in this world that you want
except for my downfall

im a victim of society circumstance or just feelings
was a nigga victimized or just willing
no blinds no bags just dealing
no foundation or floor plan just building
check it nights bright but the days dark
covered in tattoos but hate art
these eggshells i walk on are razor sharp
staring at the finish line looking for a way to start
ive been called everything an extremist
is that a bad thing or what they really mean is
anything a nigga do a nigga mean it
and i wont let a person place or thing come between it
an opportunist is how they paint me
but if the nigga only knocks once can you blame me
still i feel like my problems are great
shit if i dont never solve em im straight
on the bright side god choose me to put a lot on my plate
so he had to figure i wouldnt be bothered by the weight
im trying to change the pattern but its on loop
even an outcast in my own group
whats it mean when eybody standing next to you expects of you
everything that comes wit a spectacle
if everywhere i go i just leave behind residue
tell me trust me i wont think nothing less of you

im sorry i aint around more
come up with me or stay on the ground floor
i dont need shelter from the downpour
yall can be whatever you want just not my downfall
they tryna make me slow tryna take me no
cant be my downfall
they tryna knock my grind i wont stop im fine
cant be my downfall

no moment of clarity
the next fight showing is a rarity
severity in me against my growin popularity
rappers wont rap im forced to believe they scared of me
but can no longer use the scape goat they not aware of me
so yall can go and throw your little pot shots
some dudes dissed me and temporarily got hot
im getting my head right recollecting
yall looking for some website resurrection
being that i got too much to lose
or maybe a slight chance that a nigga guilty of all that im accused
no longer amused affected my loved ones
now they startin to bruise
and i dont want no parts of that abuse
wouldnt wish upon my worst foe a day in my shoes
thatll just eliminate any excuse
and why entertain em
old me woulda lost my senses yall just helping the new me regain em
been punched in the face
it was either feed my family or hunt wit the thirtyeight
i aint want brunch to wait
ive out grown hiphop it turned into a daycare
so next time some shit is on my mind itll stay there
im staring at the man in the mirror
but it aint helping see the man any clearer
so i get mia from around yall
till god stops answering these prayers for my downfall

tell me what am i to do
if i aint have a soul a nigga always had you pardon due
but i gotta speak candidly
how the fuck could you abandon me
wit five years of blood sweat and tears
but it was obviously a disconnect
we turned that into a disrespect
said she been holding it inside for years shes unhappy
so the girl i wan marry was afraid to come and tap me
so i went away on tour and you went on one of your own
but while you was on the horn all day wit ol boy
did you ever think about what it would do to your home
whats his name wheres he live
what is it he offers whats he got to give
and i love you so much that when i caught on to your fibs
i hit you like a man you wore it in your ribs
i was heated
but had to be strong enough to remove the infidelity and see whats underneath it
come to find out you felt lied to and cheated
mistreated and kept it a big secret
or are you just loose
and im so naive im tryna give you an excuse
now that i refuse to believe we life partners
holy water on whatever devil come and try to part us
cant use anything i ever gave you to bury me
you supposed to be the one to bury me
you wan leave then goodbye
think the grass look greener on the other side but its dye

yea joey
its that on top muzik
yea wait a minute

yo i left the jumpsuit on a park bench
slept there smellin like the park stench
freezin covered with a dark trench
that room more like the kryptonite to my clark kent
tired of all the iq tests and all the arguments
nurses light the candles with the calm scents
i aint been calm since they actin like i aint got any common sense
too much time spent for a godsend
so i left on my own recognizance handful of klonopins
lookin for a car jack vict preferably dark tints
seems you got to eat to get even and my odds slim
they say im a animal cannibal hannibal
lookin at my past i see how thats understandable
so you god damn right im unmanageable
everything im lookin at is a fuckin intangible
got me thinking that im really a skits
maybe that room didnt really exist cause i left but

these walls still closing and the room starts spinnin
and the ceiling starts falling and the devil starts grinnin
the floor starts droppin and my eyes get heavy
then ears start bleeding from the lies niggas fed me
then the door slams shut and my legs try to run
but my feet wont move then my body gets numb
and i aint on pills i cant explain how i feel
will somebody tell me this aint real
realestate

my reality is reality
they reality is all perception
in my reality thats an infection
my reality dont want no part of that detection
so i pick it up and move it to another section
they reality you would think is full of perfection
correction they reality is all deception
in reality only few will make that connection
but if you like me you know not to take that direction
if reality is dead im the resurrection
nominate myself so lets skip over the election
theyll say im the wrong selection
dont meet they expectance
but i aint lookin for motherfuckin acceptance
fuck yall expect shit the mud on ya white glove
reality is full of rules im full of objections
they reality is a big misconception
so i left just to lose my recollection but still
realestate

yo they say money makes the world go round
but it really doesnt
did i think i was in a room when i really wasnt
i thought i was on the move wasnt really budging
but you aint never wore my shoes who you really judging
some people are so judgmental ill allow that
you can judge anything but my mental
he dont know what i been through
from results of the pencil
cuts from being resentful
dont cover much of the stencil
when i couldnt walk they aint have a crutch to lend dude
so i say what i feel fuck if i offend you
some fail maybe some of succeeded
some need to be wanted some wanna be needed
i scream and yell they dont hear my call
and it seems much as i fell dont know where i fall
not at all im just actin out fate
but aint much change since i escaped all i know is

you can catch me in a strip club stacked up i dont keep em visible
wont see a man get thirsty cause im known to keep a bitch or two
probably both be bisexual i tell them chill and kick it boo
and never get uncomfortable these waitresses start kissing you
yall would call it birthday sex i call it a ritual
if you seen it like me then i already know why yall be miserable
you dont really want no problems cause those shooters theyre hospitable
and they gon grab them blockas while you try and keep it physical
pool house or that guest house it dont matter where it goes down
driveway is cobblestone garage is like a ghost town
i aint even touch em yet they feel like theyve been hosed down
if you real then you gotta respect this shit gs up hoes down

im chilling on top of the world top of the world top of the world
now you know all about me girl about me girl about me girl
tell them niggas i did it look how i came up
tell em niggas im with it if they bring my name up
tell em bitches im gone
dont be callin my phone phone if it aint bout the money baby baby

hold up lets get back to my loved ones those of yall that been with me

probably why she text me to death like joe i got a friend wit me
and id love to eat her out while you on top putting a limb in me
lets get back to them things i like lets get back to that stripper pole
lets get back to her popping that i aint even really gotta tip her though

we them dudes you wanna get to know cameras up no pictures though
looking for them broke niggas  dont aim at me there aint none
to respect my position gotta respect where a nigga came from

she know i like it when her hair curled sun dress little bit of make up on
turnpike parkway either way wont take us long
hit the club twenty minutes deuces either way im gone
be a fool if i stayed there wit an ass bouncing in my favorite thong
i came from nothing like my father was a deadbeat
wasnt for that i dont know if id say success is sweet
top of the world lets let how i sustain maintain my legacy
taking a bit of my soul but wont let it consume the rest of me
now lets get back to this paper though every day same shit
screaming rns for life some of yall dont know that language
living for you never for them best way to explain it is
i want the most because i had the least thats why im on my game biotch

sometimes a nigga need theme music uh huh
sometimes you gotta set a mood
lets dim these lights in this motherfucking booth
dim the lights out there too
i dont need to see you niggas too much jump off 
cant be mood muzik without a mood
but look its look its what its that on top music

the name of this shit right here is called roll call

niggas on my left yeah niggas on my right yeah
does anybody wanna hear some real shit tonight yeah
real as itll get yeah holster on my hip yeah
is anybody tired of that bubble gum shit yeah

they say hip hop is dead or on life support
maybe not that could be something i just thought
i just ought to jump in fighting the sport
how you expect to be heard when your mic is off
i would love to go and browse through the robb report
but aint a car in that motherfucker i can afford
see niggas trying to block the road
rather then my label drop the growth they should drop us both oh

they aint really giving a fuck unless you jeezy
thats what my mind say
just know if you aint the president or kanye you wont see the time of day

im so thankful that

we dont crank or snap we aim and clap
used to try to take the average rap fan show em shit
but if they closeminded who am i to open it
rather spend time with a bougie broad
mean an actress bad bitch movie star
shallow bitches only into jewelry cars
still fuck with us though that aint who we are
soon as my wife gone they jump on the python
they aint know im out to hit and run like saigon
putting back the ice on had it screwed up
finally figured out that hate is the new love
but i dont see how you get ahead that way
when you team up with envy like red cafe
and all that blame is yours nigga
you trying to get a chain like floss
im trying to get a chain like stores
find me in jers line for squeeze work off safety
cant keep calm around these jerks think beyond these words
treat the hood like myspace either become friends with the tommy first
so get found on the back of an empty carton
spray semi larkins for the bread like remy martin
dont mind me last of a dying breed
wanna take rap and bring it back to the ninetys
juicy inspired me cream made me angry
get at me dog amped me shook ones aint me
i already know its a tough state to follow
when niggas use to stay up late to watch apollo
now its ridiculous all this shits frivolous
niggas aint macho man they miss elizabeth

yoim seeing a couple things wrong with the way that im living
so come and walk with me i just need a second opinion
introduce you to my friends i got to see if you notice
if they loyal or if they all got an ulterior motive
see some snake niggas me and them dont deal anymore
ever since i got signed i dont know whats real anymore
im paranoid so excuse me if i seem to be nervous
but everybody from my past now they trying to resurface
trying to rekindle they dont think i know they gone limo
i got cousins i never knew they trying to pass me a demo
maybe im wrong like i told you main i need your opinion
me and him never spoke before so i dont see whats so different
dudes i dont know they recognize me start extending they hand
and im trippin ready for beef when he was only a fan why
cause these niggas in my hood say they dont like how im reppin
let me know how strongly you feel will i be needing my weapon
as some sort of protection should i carry a pen and pad
and ask everybody in the fucking hood for they suggestion
im letting the labels know that jersey city is gifted dog
when they didnt know that jersey city existed but its cool dog
certain cats in jersey city so hateful hatefulll
and certain cats in jersey city aint grateful aint gratefulllll
all they say is i dont chill anymore
and ever since i got signed they dont think im real anymore
im told i shouldnt be alone cause im a star in my hood
something might happen mouse they know who you are in the hood they do
so i cant tell you how i feel anymore
ever since i got signed i cant tell whats real anymore you feelin me dog

see to me its heavy but to you it may seem petty
lets continue walking i know you aint tired already
i take you to meet my girl i got to see if you notice
if she love me or if the bitch got an ulterior motive
why am i hated cause i handle my business
aint gotta look for a girl nowadays cause almost all these niggas is bitches
see em often while we walking ill show you the drug dealers
and some dudes that hate me word on the streets is they real killers dog
where was the hate back when i wasnt on my feet
an alcoholic school dropout just a bum on the street
where was the hate during my adolescence
back when that psychiatrist was trying hard to get me on them antidepressants
so man i dont recall none of this happenin back then
and i dont understand i was still rappin back then
so i got to ride with a gun
from trying to get my mom and pop up out of the slums and provide for my son
if you met my baby moms would you notice
if she was ready for a child of if her ass had an ulterior motive
i dont know what shes teaching trey but everday he get older
angies bitter and feel like now that im successful i owe her
cause she would hold me so tight when i was ready to relapse
tell me to relax i aint know no better straight out of rehab
bottom line i was lonesome
but we was wrong for each other angie i grown some
got bigger issues if you went to def jam would you notice
if they was out for my best interest or do they just see a dollar in joseph
ugh guess i aint sure how i feel anymore
ever since i got signed i cant tell whats real anymore
i mean them same record execs that wanted me in
dont care that im the next nigga they just wanna see spins i swear
guess i aint sure how i feel anymore
ever since i got signed i cant tell whats real anymore you feelin me dog

what ive felt what ive known
never shined through in what ive shown
never be never see
wont see what might have been
what ive felt what ive known
never shined through in what ive shown
never free never me
so i dub thee unfourgiven

lets talk about the struggle lets talk about the pain
some people say they love you but that dont mean a thang
some folks is so naive not me i go insane
some people dap you they hug you they do it all in vain
thats my depression talking maybe its really real
maybe them doctors was right and maybe im really ill
see i cant really chill without feeling the guilt of me
stealing these pills is anybody feeling me still shit
except for the hood nobody told me i ever could instead i pushed
back when they told me i never would looking at me like i was just a crook
i express the hood and what i see on the daily
my scenery daily task force bes daily
a task yall being me daily they want to put three in me nail me
this is stuff you only read in the daily
had product but aint supply it then high off more than weed
so the product just got me higher then product of my environment
look at where they put me and look where they telling me i gotta be
stop and see the robberies the poverty naw fam its not for me
its got to be an opt at least without dudes getting chased by police
so they gave us film sports and the gift to make a hot cd
back to the wall against the ropes nothings believable feasible
they dont believe in you youve been verbally beaten to
a pulp so the result to you think nothing is reachable
reasonable i tell you dreams come true yeah haters even you

now take your hands and wave em high they told me i cant but i said why
like fuck it ill try not fuck it and die
see this is real emotion we deal wit often and dont reveal it
often we stuff it inside but im like fuck it lets ride
i do what i do because i do what i do what i feel
they do what they do in hopes of what they do may appeal
they got a image and persona that they gotta fill
that they better do for revenue so labels will be thrilled
kindoffeel like a wanted man
i cant talk to folk cause when i ask em to trust me all they wanna do is judge me im feeling like they dont understand
im feeling like aint too many people friendly
i feel like aint too many people are what they pretend to be cause im in that zone i feel alone like everybody is against me
just feel like im worst enemy and naw its not a cry for no sympathy
im just thinking out loud to a crowd im just trying to figure out some remedy
almost like every lesson its like every jewel every tool thats ever been lent to me
but the moment is gone im like a new born i feel like a man with no memory
slow it down for a second make sure im not losing you
or confusing you
im delusional if you never been there then you have no idea what illusions do
through and through im hoping these signs aint vital
or none of these rhymes inside the recital
why do it mean im suicidal i aint that houston dude
but im a maniac
dont get over drunk or sober this the same way id act
and im striving to pull together but at least until these voices inside of me
go forever be alarmed im liable to do whatever

im from the school of pussy dont get me punch drunk
maybe its different in the city you come from look
im from the school of these hoes belong to everybody
no celeb exempt goes for everybody
so when i seen you fucked shorty not a bitter bone in me
i aint think of how to handle the plan
said im aware have fun understand that its fam
told that to you and not her thats just the man that i am
my nigga kids got no respect
odd cause you called me for the hoe check on every hoe you checked
that makes sense bad bitches thats what joe do best
and is the man round these parts when they aint know you yet
which kinda makes me your og in toronto
and i aint charge once thats for free in toronto
im unsure how that came to be in toronto
nigga i dont even be in toronto

shit i had bria in the coupe and out her way
before you ever wrote an interlude about her
so who you playin with clown
im first shift at the bars so only means i already made them rounds
they say that he the best mc and best flower
he cook better than me but you love my leftovers

you playin chess with the chrome of the pump
let it blast checkered past shoulda known from the jump
its whatever you wanna roll executives got your soul
sedatives im repetitive with those records show for
regular joe sellin records was never the goal
i never sold records i kept records of what was sold

ayo kane found logan lamping at delucas
sitting with a little black boy she called him lucas he knew it
found himself the daughter of a kingpin
the ex of tony starks its a winwin
his seed the grief filled up in his eyes
he kidnapped them both for a scheme of revenge
pillow cases over their heads tossed in the benz
no friends no foes only evil to expose
lets make a video
tell lu i got his grandson and daughter
and i aint lookin for no ransom
i want revenge i want blood i want his head on a rug
i want him to watch me strangle his daughter
butcher his babies attack pits foamin out the mouth with rabies
meightys stuffed in his ass cause bodily harm
this is just the fuckin tip of the storm
tell him to come tell him we need to speak man to mush
as soon as he step in the buildingambush

at day break the delucas made their way through the main gate
quietest cougars chasing wild gang prey
they cut through the chained fence up through the five escape steps
they raided the kane gang 
the look on kanes face when he realized what was taken place
he was anticipating a payday but he was faced with a melee
he sprained to his feet but his legs wouldnt stay straight
afraid he reached for his piece bang bang bang bang
but wait as if on cue the deluca crew called out lucas
and began shooting unison maneuvering from each of the rooms in pursuit of kane
blew smoke and the cue dreamt irrefutable stench of mutilated flesh and the death of human beings
finally it was over
the delucas lowered their revolvers and put them back in their shoulder holsters
they shifted through the dead remains
the bedrooms and the entry way
where the hell is lester kane

now what is this that stands before me
underneath his black cloth coughing
its logan and her half breed offspring
i got the nod from kane that ill be enforcing
this cruel source of my arbitration
ominous calm with the calmest concentration
this job i take it with pride and consideration
with no problem i bring violence without wild provocation
im delivering deaths invitation
 elevation will be the compensation for the confrontation
the delucas get wiped out without complication
if something goes wrong and i have to
ill step back and shoot
im the actual monster no zipper on the back of my suit
my squad is biblical but its backed by the truth
got worse schizophrenia than jekyll and hyde do
the menace weapon thats been cast out of heaven
i hope the delucas dont realize theyve been lied to

kanes gang had no imply the delucas had staked out the vacated building for eight days
they knew about his way in the way out the makeshift escape route
the hidden staircase the way down to the basement in the safe house
where to find logan and her afraid child
in a dark corner where they were being held
they were blindfolded with taped mouths
no light or water arms and legs bound

but theres a double cross of course im hearing guns letting off from somewhere else
im ready to get involved with the revolving  warehouse all by myself
i dive underground finding rounds

i am delivering deaths invitation
i am delivering deaths invitation
i am delivering deaths invitation
i am delivering deaths invitation
i am delivering deaths invitation

aiyyo turn those lights down while im recording

i want to give yall a little announcement man
for the last year theres been a lot of music comin out
the shit been weak knowhatimsayin
a lot of niggas trying to take hiphop
and make that shit rb rap and bullshit yaknowhatimsayin
or make that shit funk
fuck that this is mcin right here this is hiphop

and like the wu we bring it to you in the purest form
we reside far away from the norms
spawn from the big catch big bang big breaks
fetch pads and pens even with the pencil
rap labels studied us flooded us with stencil
thats tinseltown murder your display
and we stay flying even with the terrorists trying
this to that town monitor the pat down
searching for controlled substance with sustenance
we inventors of the drug ever since
dayglo covers broke pots green balloons
the black shirt saying stakes elevated noon
aoi grind you hear it
understand we steer it
some choose to veer it off the course
the main source missing
youve paid no dues youve earned no pension
learn the rules you can either be the pimp
or the pimped out tools
wack niggas need not forget

stop running up on niggas with
all that wack shit
word up man
talkin bout you emcee
you aint no emcee

like me
i bake works of art
while labels worry bout artwork
or top of the chart perks
you need to insert a lot more of that
original tier that you cant manage
just causes damage so just go get away from here
youre fuckin the game up
too low to aim up so just go get away from here

and somell believe that theyre leaders
young fella youre a two liter
simply waterway drowning out the source
this lesson is aligned with an underground cause
so sharpen your paper mate my number twosll make the beacon shine
and you sound effects
the fine lining is detail the garment is retail
but i dont buy rap or excuses
the code used to be an unspoken device
but since thats gone you see what rap produces
yknahmsayin
the one on one two on twos
assemble in the center of squares like statues word up
understand i just do this i dont have to
yknahmsayin this is hiphop right here
yknahmsayin this is lyrics
but you wouldnt know that feeling if it slapped you
like new credit the blood works indebted
microphone donor two pints of get right
i got my cardio up my nigga
dont give a damn about a party
i do it for the body
upchuck your mandibles the scramblers back
since the two inch tape how ample is that
like furry dice hanging off the mirror
your position is concerning my vision
these objects seem to be closer than they appear
and they could never catch us their directions dont match up
just go get away from here
youre jamming the lane up
messing the game up
just go get away from here

look man youre botherin me g
i got shit to do right now aight
this is for de la soul yknahmsayin
word up i got shit to do you test tube baby laughing
check one two check one two
de la soul is now back on the map
long island is now back on the map
good rap music is now back on the map
yo check one two this is the voice of yours truly the flava flav
and i just want yall to know we aint goin nowhere
old school is here to stay boy
  flava flav
on the outskirts of what works
live those who go for broke and merk to get merked
live by the sword and die by the semi
not part of my ways but stays right in my
ny mentality for me to be the best
the current the ones who werent
pressed to confess lies over hot joints
to sell to all who wanna hear some
younguns these days got fireproof eardrums
they dont give a shit whos hot
just long as youre not pussy and be the wouldbe king
but once crowned the same wanna pull you down
and what makes the world go round
and i be the world renowned wonder why
wonderin why you cant stand me
is it because im the main jackson
and yall just titos and randys yes it is
bless the kid who hold his own head and expect to last
at the same time i want respect and cash
and a few paragraphs in them books
tellin you how us native tongues made hits with no hooks
rapped in every prefixes since gave birth to rap remixes back in eightyeight
no disrespect to diddy just settin it straight
instead of zigzaggin got a degree in braggin
my daughter says im a teen cause like a teen
my pants always saggin and i walk with a bop
the sags part of my time my walk from my pops
no longer on tommy and was never on loud
but cooked rhymes that make the chefs of wu proud
im top cloud to rain on your show
and still anything goes when it comes to hoes because

make you shake like sunshine naked shoe was once mine
had bottom inner drawers and used to hit it from the mids
fix your playground player or some kidsll
come stomp in your sandbox swollen hands cocked back
no knives no drama no guns
no disrespectin your seed or ma dukes
i puke rhyme and you laugh take a sniff
of these fricaseed raps on carribean riffs
see last nights change was todays dough money
no time for your freestyles so roll money
no more whack albums with two joints
no more ballplayin rappers who shoot ya two points
no more g cause im sick of your hiphop
your flows bore like seashores with no bitches
switchhittin niggas will receive no pitches
no diamonds on the field just keep the game real
simple see the god flows healthy
wealth in the mind is like money in the bank
exchange cash like thoughts in conversation
thank you for your purchases we dough out
and roll out the koolaid  see us pimp strut
aint really pimpin im tryin to catch the bus
the krush groove aint got shit on cold crush
we dolly dolly babies cause we shootin cats
back to the future rap with doc brown shotgunnin it
and pantyhose your whole style and start runnin it
you dudes fiddle while we stay on the cello
the mushinyourroom son we stay portobello
cant settle for the same picket white fence
i got dreams of barbed wire in front of factories pa
still push the truck with the factories pa
im bound to wreck the whip and turn insurance out make em shout

as the cold night folds round
we be creeping without a sound
with rydas who are bound
as the steering wheel turns around
our ghost car drifting in and out the street lights
wizards in the back who know the craft of street fights
heads be bobbing
as smoke is floating from window cracks
a nightmare cadillac with white reflected off our gats
demons without reason
or the mercy we once knew
revenge is like the sweetest joy
bringing visions of de ja vu

the worst punishment for crime is when they fuck off your time

out here we all pacmans in a maze runnin from ghouls every day im hustlin
but like fouls we tend to overlook the privilege and the right
to be given this life
we focus on the bullshit and the strife
shit aint always right but whats wrong a car line long
much worse a hearse
we aint better off in a coffin in some church
or with lurch in the morgue filleted like perch
life sucks weve all sang that song til we heard the fat gong
buried in a dirt nap lawn like
boy was i wrong that wasnt that long
let me go again and get my mack on
realize the prize recognize game and peep
and dont be a lame sheep and dont sleep
you got a lot to live for think not and get more
love life its what the shit for

bless me with the sight of a satellite
i cant always see from here
cant always see clear from down here
bless me with the sight of a satellite
i cant always see from here the bigger picture disappears

i was out drinking all night long
riding home when something went gong
there she was a prostitute
she look like a druggy but god she cute
standing out front a seedy motel
im blew out drunk like what the hell
and she was young like twentyone
i asked her pimp if she could have some fun
how much to keep her with me til dawn
four hundred duckets and it was on
he posted up outside the room
guarding his treasure a certified goon
there we were inside her spot
five minutes later she was smoking a rock
and i was shocked i just stared
but something burning inside me cared
we talked all night i passed on fucking
but that glass dick she kept sucking
she was gone but she was sweet
she was clean but had funky feet
she said her pimp only feeds her rocks
and pays her shit she cant clean her socks
together they travel from town to town
he gets paid while she gets down
behind her life of agonizing
she had a beauty that was hypnotizing
i thought what if i made her mine
send her to rehab on my dime
cleaned her up washed her hair
all she needs is someone to care
i could help her escape these streets so mean
and take her home where the sheets are clean
help her escape that evil devil
and upgrade her to life on my level
asked was she down she couldnt believe it
and started to cry how do we achieve it
i told her just escape your room
and be out front exactly at noon
and ill swoop on by and scoop you up
look for me in my big black truck
she was with it we had a plan
i said goodbye and i kissed her hand
i was determined when i got home to be there at noon
and wed be gone
i laid my head down with dreams of grandeur
was she there ill never know the answer
i overslept and woke up at three
sobered up like whats wrong with me
i dont want no crackhead fucking sleeze
as my girlfriend shit please
i laughed it off and went back to bed
she can have that pimp instead

what the fuck was i thinking
i dont want no hooker
i was up all night drinking
i thought she was a looker
my delusions of grandeur
made me think i could have her
made me think i could save her
damn i was way to faded
woah oh oh
ah damn
i was way too faded off
woah

motherfucker i can speak to crows
i see through their eyes
i can hear the truth behind the wickedest lies
i can snap my fingers and make fire appear
i see visions of the future through a crack in the mirror
im supernatural i turn water to ice
with my bare hands i dont need a freezer device
i can bend the spoon tie it up in a knot without touching it once
true powers i got
i can spit hot acid i can see in the dark
because im supernatural and im living my part
i can levitate cards but im not a magician
cause my magic is official while these others are wishin
i can read your palm i got the telekinesis
concentrate on a piece of fruit and blow it to pieces
i can see through walls and guess the color youre wearin
before you walk in the room
my super psyche is flarin
i can close my eyes and read the page of a book
i can tell you where your keys are and dont have to look
im supernatural its in the beat of my heart
the only bone that comes with it is the hard part

i can feel the pain of the dead
the angry dead
the lost and alone i feel em bang in my head
they yell for someone else but i can hear em instead
i can hear em instead i can hear em instead
i feel the pain of the dead
the lost and alone i feel em bang in my head
they yell for someone else but i can hear em instead
i can hear em instead i can hear em instead
supernatural without the hat tricks
sometimes i find em floatin just above my mattress
i dont have to hit the switch to cut the lights on
i dont have to say check to know my mics on
i got the esp extraordinarily
so much my momma used to say ok youre scarin me
i can tell you what hand you got the ball in
without the id i can always tell whos callin
i can melt a candle down just by starin at it
if i keep glarin at it steady wearin at it
the wind blows everytime i walk outside
dogs dont bark they howl
most cats hide
cause im supernatural like a vampire
see me hold out my hand and withstand fire
i can turn it all on or off as i go
the only part i cant control

is when i feel the pain of the dead
the angry dead
the lost and alone i feel em bang in my head
they yell for someone else but i can hear em instead
i can hear em instead i can hear em instead
i feel the pain of the dead
the lost and alone i feel em bang in my head
they yell for someone else but i can hear em instead
i can hear em instead i can hear em instead

i was never nothing popular and neither was she
she was kind though always had a smile for me
i never thought much about her didnt see her that way
and she was always out sick missing every other day
now that i think about it we was always saying hello
i always figured cuz we both were people alone
i hardly knew her at all she sat behind me in some classes
what was really going on behind her glasses
and why was

vera lee
haunting me here with me
vera lee
watching me carefully
vera lee
haunting me here with me
vera lee
watching me carefully
vera lee
haunting me here with me
vera lee
watching me carefully
vera lee
haunting me here with me
vera lee
watching me carefully

when i heard she passed away i must admit i was sad
cuz of all the mean faces hers was sweet and always glad
i hardly knew her for nothing i only knew she was cool
a quiet soul fragile slipping through the hallways at school
and now that shes gone i can hear her crying my name
although it doesnt make sense to think about its insane
but what if i was something special to her cuz i said hi
what if she would always dream about if i was her guy
and what if those hellos that we shared went a long way
what if she felt for me like in a strong way
what if she was ill but always tried to make it in
just to see me in the halls and share our hellos again
why was

vera lee
haunting me here with me
vera lee
watching me carefully
vera lee
haunting me here with me
vera lee
watching me carefully
vera lee
haunting me here with me
vera lee
watching me carefully
vera lee
haunting me here with me
vera lee
watching me carefully
why
is she calling down to me
to me
why
is she calling out to me
to me
she was pale and looked so ill and so frail
maybe she looked at my life and how its so stale
and thought were both outcasts maybe we could have each other
it flew right over my head i never even bothered
now its too late and every night i hear her in my head
begging me to join her with the dead meh
to think about its so strange i hear her singing my name
vera lee is haunting my brain i hear her in the rain

why
is she calling out to me
to me
why
is she calling out to me
to me
why
is she calling out to me
to me
why
is she calling out to me
to me
why
tell me why is she calling down to me
to me
why
why
why

im falling down the stair case tumble to the floor
i land up in the attic next to the cellar door
im play with the pigons they tell me many lies
they tell me ill have wings if i let them peck my eyes
i hear a womans voice calling from the dirt
i plat my little seed and slowly she will spurt
and now she is a tree i hear the heart pound
i take her in my arems and we make love to the sound
the wind is my ebony blowing evil thoughts
carrying the demons soring with the hearts
i put it in my body the wind will bring the rain
only lay its demon egg deep inside my brain
theyre calling me a killer i cant say that im not
my daddys tried to kill me ever since i was a tot
by poisoning my bottle i feed it to my friend
cuz if he dies my buddy our friendship will never end
im sitting with the darkness talking to the dark
its singing lullabies and stringing on the harp

in the spirit of god
in the spirit of the ancestors
in the spirit of the black panthers
in the spirit of assata shakur
we make this movement towards freedom
for all those who have been oppressed and all those in the struggle
yeah yo check it

there were lights and sirens gunshots firing
cover your eyes as i describe a scene so violent
seemed like a bad dream she laid in a blood puddle
blood bubbled in her chest cold air brushed against open flesh
no room to rest pain consumed each breath
shot twice with her hands up
police questioned but shot before she answered
one panther lost his life the other ran for his
scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her
comprehension she was beyond trying to hold on
to life she thought shed live with no arm
thats what it felt like got to the hospital eyes held tight
they moved her room to roomshe could tell by the light
handcuffed tight to the bed through her skin it bit
put guns to her head every word she got hit
who shot the trooper they asked her
put mace in her eyes threatened to blast her
her mind raced till things got still
opened her eyes realized shes next to her best friend who got killed
she got chills they told her thats where she would be next
hurt mixed wit anger survival was a reflex
they lied and denied visits from her lawyer
but she was building as they tried to destroy her
if it wasnt for this german nurse they wouldve served her worse
i read this sisters story knew that it deserved a verse
i wonder what would happen if that wouldve been me
all of this just so we could be free
so dig it yall

im thinking of assata yes
listen to my love assata yes
your power and pride is beautiful
may god bless your soul

it seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her
walkietalkies crackling i see them when theyre taking her
though she kind of knew
what made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue
arrived to middlesex prison about six in the morning
uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in
a cell one cot no window facing hell
put in the basement of a prison with all males
and the smell of misery seatless toilets and centipedes
shed exercise paint and begin to read
two years in a hole her soul grew weak
away from people so long she forgot how to speak
she discovered freedom is a unspoken sound
and a wall is a wall and can be broken down
found peace in the panthers she went on trial with
one of the brothers she had a child with
the foulness they would feed her hoping shes lose her seed
held tight knowing the fight would live through this seed
in need of a doctor from her stomach shed bleed
out of this situation a girl was conceived
separated from her left to mother the revolution
and lactated to attack hate
cause federal and state was built for a black fate
her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates
they fabricated cases hoping one would stick
and said she robbed places that didnt exist
in the midst of threats on her life and being caged with aryan whites
through dark halls of hate she carried the light
i wonder what would happen if that wouldve been me
all of this just so we could be free
yeah i often wonder what would happen if that wouldve been me
all of this just so we could be free
so dig it people

im thinking of assata yes
listen to my love assata yes
your power and pride is beautiful
may god bless your soul

yo from north carolina her grandmother would bring
news that she had had a dream
her dreams always meant what they needed them to mean
what made them real was the action in between
she dreamt that assata was free in their old house in queens
the fact that they always came true was the thing
assata had been convicted of a murder she couldnt of done
medical evidence shown she couldnt have shot the gun
its time for her to see the sun from the other side
time for her daughter to be by her mothers side
time for this beautiful woman to become soft again
time for her to breathe and not be told how or when
she untangled the chains and escaped the pain
how she broke out of prison i could never explain
and even to this day they try to get to her
but shes free with political asylum in cuba

im thinking of assata yeah
listen to my love assata yeah
were molded from the same mud assata
we share the same blood assata yeah
your power and pride so beautiful
may god bless your soul
your power and pride so beautiful
may god bless your soul

writin niggas with stripes i hold posture with

love is not a mystery its everything

she was the type to watch oprah and the today show
be on the treadmill uh like ok go
had a body a body that you cant pay fo
that mean she had some ds on her but they wasnt fake though
had a drive for a drive for rodeo
she spent pesos on those labels
spin class at the gym strip tease on a pole
she was so obsessed with her body and clothes
to every party she goes tryin hard to be chose
they say its hard for a pimp but extra hard for these hoes
readin us and people mag tryna get the scoop
chasin a actor for a bentley coupe
she been through the ball player from the clippers then came the pumps off
all thinkin she number one where she was just a jumpoff
doin all she can for a man and a baby
drivin herself crazy like the astronaut lady

he had paper since we was in we was in high school
pop was a doc mom taught at my school
lock with the rocks in his ears he kept jewels
one of the diddy types da dddame dash dudes
pushed a maserati sport reading the robb report
wanted to be mike but he was never live at sports
since golf is in he was on the drivin course
to live the rap life is what he was strivin for
spendin cash at the bar to get credit
drinkin chaundon just because big said it
they say ye is but dude was big headed
rocked the fur in the summer so somebodyd pet it
he had a fetish for shoes thats athletic
pathetic on his myspace page half nekkid
its a shame what they do for fame and to be respected
joe you coulda got it if you never woulda stressed it

they was one of them couples people said they were the it
unbreakable like bobby and whit
or ryan and reese or kimora and russ
relationships can be dead but look live to us
i guess we all been through it where we try too much
losin yourself and youre lyin and stuff
wishin for the diamond cuffs in search of a ring
where love is not a mystery its everything

gets me down
gets me down
gets me down
gets me down
gets me down
gets me
love is not a mystery its everything

ahhhhhhh yeah

or radio its livin in me
hey lady that smoke is bothering me
if i put it in your eye ashes you would cry

hollywood sold you a dream like how the fuck you fall for this

aye lawd
knowledge aye
i got flows that i got to kill and people that i got to see and shit i got to do twox
verse one
put the pen to the page though
like a canvas so i can let the pain flow
five hundred and thirty in the mother fucking morning
nigga waking up to go and get his younger brother ready for school
said its a hell of a task
that nigga never had a chance to relax
his father left when he was young
so he the man of the house now
but his mother wasnt nothing more than a fiend
itching for another fix
living with the pipe dream
get the fuck out of the house you got to go and get it
aint nobody gonna pay your rent and
aint nobody gonna put no fucking food upon the table for your family to eat
you want to starve motherfucker or do you want to survive 
the only thought upon the young nigga mind is the way he maintains
and maneuvers through a plain
from the snakes in the grass
and anyone is a seed
when youre looking like a meal
and they might just eat you
hes telling his brother to finish his breakfast so they can both leave
gotta take him to the bus stop and every other day
the walk consist a different life story
tryin to tell him how it is and the way that the world goes
everything aint always gonna work out in your favor
but never lose faith
cause only god can save us
and do what the fuck it really takes
to stay away from the streets
at least an armslength
do not look for strength
within the words of another
to cover an insecurity
courtesy of a hunger
to hustle and get your currency
but never lose sight of the goal
that youre pursuin
the reason you even do it or who it is that youre helpin
try your best to find a purpose
diverted from any ignorance
and bust your fuckin ass to make sure that youre more intelligent
but try to understand that you must develop a plan
never let nobody else make you feel less than
god damn
i got flows that i got to kill and people that i got to see and shit i got to do do do threex
young nigga on the motherfuckin move and he refuse to lose
dont ever get it confuse
lawd 

put your mother fucking backpack on
we out the door in five mintues or less
say yo we really gotta go
his mother banging on the floor
and she begging to get a hit
she feeling sick and he can notice it
he moving up the steps
so he can find out what the issue is
it wasnt insignificant
he went inside his room and saw his mother in the shit again
running through the stash
he was feeling disappointed
now why cant you be responsisible
do you think that its possible
that you could be the parent
instead of giving me obstacles that imma overcome upon the daily
mom why cant you get a job
and how the fuck are you dependant on the shit that ive been selling so that we can keep the lights on
you done turned me and my younger brother into a couple of victims
of your addiction
but you dont ever want to listen
im trying to make it happen for us here right now
but with the way that youre acting
i see that you dont really care
she was already gone
lost in a blank stare
it was at that point of time that he finally realized it was hopeless
grabbed his younger brother by the hand and said
we really gotta go the bus is leaving in a couple of minutes
they get to concrete and moving to get it
you better mind your fucking business while were out here in the street
i wanna show you how to be a better man
so that you can understand
everything that shines is not gold
theres a woman selling pussy for the proper restitution
with a nigga pushing pills on the people to feel sedated
theres a body on the ground
but the spirit is elevated
aint nobody seen what happened
its definitley gang related
just another act of violence committed from one of the natives
i hope you pay attention
and see what im really saying
and sure thats a fucked up lesson
i pray you never forget it
but dont ever be complacent
the skies your only limit
god damn
