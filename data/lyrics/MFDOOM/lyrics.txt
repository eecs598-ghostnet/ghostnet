before we go any further
friends

as you call em they call you when they need something
trees for the blunt the gs for the front
i found a way to get peace of mind for years and left the hell alone
turn a deaf ear to the cellular phone
send me a letter or better we could see each other in real life
just so you could feel me like a steel knife
at least so you could see the white of they eyes
bright with surprise once they finish spitting lies
asssociates is your boys your girls bitches niggas homies
close but really dont know me
mom dad comrade peeps brothers sisters duns dunnies
some come around when they need some money
others make us laugh like the sunday funnies
fam be around whether you paid or bummy
you could either ignore this advice or take it from me
be too nice and people take you for a dummy
so nowadays he aint so friendly
actually they wouldnt have made a worthy enemy
read the signs no feeding the baboon
seein as how they got ya back bleeding from the stab wounds
yall know the dance they smile in ya face yall know the glance
try to put em on they blow the chance
never let your socalled mans know your plans
how many of us have them a show of hands
friends is a term some people use loosely
im real choosy on what i choose to let crews see
you telling me i try to act broke
jealousy the number one killer among black folk
fellas be under some type of spell like crack smoke
ghetto cinderellas lead em right to your stack loc
just another way a chickll lead to your end
i check the dictionary for the meaning of friend
it said person one who likes to socialize with
sympathiser helper and thats about the size of it
most of the time these attributes is onesided
to bolster the crime theyre apt to shoot you through your eyelid
and they cant hide it going wild like a white bitch
sometimes ya need to cut niggas off like a light switch
click and when things get quiet
catch em like a thief in the night what a riot
i first met mr fantastik at a arms deal
dont let it get drastic think of how your momsll feel
when it get for real steel get to sparkin
everything darken and aint no talkin
for somethin so cheap it sure buys a lot of trouble
ya better off focusing than tryin to plot to bubble
or else itd be a sad note to end on the guns we got is
ones we can depend on friends
some come in the form of codependence
a lot of times only end up being codefendants
ten bucks say they tell for a lower sentence
and leave you up under the jail begging for a penance
it dont make no sense what happened to the loyalty
honor amongst crooks trust amongst royalty
id rather go out in a blaze than give em the glory
how many of us have a similar story
friends before lovers we used to have some type of overstanding
just so when i let her get the man thing she know its no strings
we could do the damn thing but ho its no rings
just how the tramp swings
will she see em again
that depends on how good was the skins and could she memorize the lessons
it aint no need to pretend
even though she let em stab it she know theyre just friends

friends
how many of us have them
friends
ones we can depend on
friends
how many of us have them
friends

not perfect for every situation but edible wrappers could actually beef up your next meal
you would only want to use the wraps when theres no food associated with the use of the wraps
so uh some potential uses include um wrapping bolt packed in a larger package
and in that case the the wrap will actually form into a sauce when you cooked cooked your meats
um theres also been interest in um development of using the wrap and then actually rip up the wrap in case you will get weary the next day
its hoped edible wrappers will do a couple of things
create a new demand for produce
stop throwing out as much garbage as they do
and eat more chitlins

and thats the last time i saw her
but thousands of more horrors on online gomorrah
and sodom they got em with they curls out
and they got a better sales pitch than the girl scouts
i wonder what i owe her
for a whole box of caramel coconut samoa
nite nite uh ok honey sweet dreams
now its time to get serious like peek freans
a metal handful wipe it on the quilt
wife wake up and im killt over spilt milk
locked in looking at your picture
fully clothed winter and i right there with ya
thinking about the last time i split your wishbone
a man could only wish you do the same til he get home
fat chance at least he get snacks
thatd have to do til a brother get back
until then smack oneeyed jack
and hope one of his peoples can hook him with a tripack
thats three different flavors
chocolate vanilla and strawberry wafers
acting all hard bout to get beat up
ill show him what time it is once i get this sheet up
soon as he fell off the beat down
all i hear is thirteenth cell put the sheet down
damn co what the hell do she know
besides the fact she wanna get dug out on the dlow
a workaholic with a fountain in the ink pen
out in the mountains and i stopped drinking again
in the wee hours hes gotten farther
needing three showers being hot and bothered
the wiz with her legs bent pregnant
god bless the day she wondered where her egg went
i need a l its hard to drink without it
and could use some kookies but trying not to think about it
watching bet on jazz for knowledge on file
every other commercial college hoes gone wild

wheat thins saltines or triscuits
matzos or cheezits

chips ahoy double chocolate chunk
something with the bubble and the junk in the trunk
even the oreos no matter what weather
always kept em dipped in milk and stuck together
in the game hes shameless
even uses a code name famous amos
its cheaper than a short stay at the days inn
and good like twentyfive cent oatmeal raisin
give a hand to who invented the camera
skip past the gram animal in grandmas
shh make sure she dont wake from her dream chill
or get caught with a handful of cream fill
oh honey what are you doing thats so nasty

good health to you all
uh over this way
look out
alright pops still feel like charging me for that meal
one look at his featureless face
one look was enough to ensure his safety
as years passed he became even more bitter and angry
burning with vengeance against the world
finally amidst hidden scrolls he found what hed been seeking
then clothed in a suit of invulnerable armor and possessing the worlds greatest secrets of science and magic he returned to his homeland
and there he has remained
scheming dreaming planning
plotting his mad campaign to conquer the entire world
i cant believe it
alright dont make a big deal about it
i warn you doom youve gone too far
yeah
thatll do it doom get your machine


xthree
i just lie awake and think of pleasant nights wed spend
under summers magic spell
but when autumn came her love did not remain
and made my world a living hell


hes a shady character whats his name
ah wait a minute  ive got his card
oo yes here it is doom i see
 it aint nuttin like hip hop music
it aint nuttin like a fist full of cash or a bliss full of the hash
that twist like a mustache from end to end spread it like a rash
from talking through your walkman or at your disco bash
give me the timbs rumpelstiltskin brown
a metal face mask with a built in frown
a mic to tilt down a hundred thousand pounds
and see how kilt sound like spilt milk clown
cocoa butter on very ashy day fam
with raybans out on the islands of cayman
or ill break it down for the layman
bain de soleil for that saint trope tannnn
a can a ole gold too cold to hold slow ya roll
keep on moving like soul ii soul hold the dough
like a fool who stole pity yall
from tryna go up against city hall titty bar
the black mic is like a red violin
ok everybody back to the lab try again
bloody rap game like leviathan
leave a bad taste killin my high like niacin
stop kiddin middlemen need ritalin
hit me with the full tin of gin and im a kid again
keep the bong lightin straight through the song writin
the supervillain aka the thong bitin thats inviting all
to the reciting thats dope and raw
hoping all yall come in peace and its open bar
tear the roof off this bumba ras clot
by the end of the night spazz like shazbot
spilt a shot made the pen lines runny
a ill plot thats ten times ben steins money funny
how he rips the scripts with a straight face
with more rhymes than is lines in ya database
placing rappers in endangerment whos reckless
with this food for thought sorta like breakfast
you could mark it off as wreck on the checklist
wear gold fronts cant afford no necklace
shit that there could go to help buildin daycares
somebody say yeahh yeahhh
pay ya fares give the herbalizers their shares
and yall could pay doom in beers cheers


hot shit aww shit

i strive to be humble lest i stumble
never sold a jumbo or copped chicken with its mumbo
sauce tyson is a fowl holocaust
hitler gassed your whole head up with poultry im fed up
ignore cordon bleu stand up get up
lunge for your knife dont forget your potholders
hot shit

what these old things about to throw em away
with the gold rings that make em dont fit like oj
usually i take them off with oil of olay
mcs is crabs in a barrel pass the old bay
hot as hell and its a cold day innit
working on a way that we can roll away tinted
some say the price of holding heat is often too high
you either be in a coffin or you be the new guy
the one thats too fly to eat shoo pie
never too busy when it comes down to you and i
swear to god a lot of niggas wish to die
they need to hold they horses theres bigger fish to fry
youre on the list if not pick a number spot
ten and a half timbs is made to kick your bumba claat

fone hundred and fifty quad cab but ill be straight
money comes and goes like that two bit hussy
that night that tried to rush me dwight pass the dutchie
so i can calm down so they dont get it twisted
take it from the fire side it wont get blistered
got it what happened oh its not lit
these metal fingers be holding hot shit

when i was four i penned god was born in new york
back in seventyseven still got nan in the crescent
the effervescence of gods presence is thick
unlike vapor esther rolle extra raw word to the baker
peace to the hardworkin gingerbread makers
looked her up and down said hmm too much makeup
poor music taste ten years from being grown up
rappers dont blow up heads do aww shit
my name is dwight spitz imma sonic addict
i use to think it was merely a nagging habit
born under a bad sign im serious about this curse of mine
i strive to flip it into fine wine
barely born a virgin is what the stars said
black not white red all over though like elmo
twentyeight years have passed i feel im peaking
i make music every weekend
its a chore a fact of life a labor of love
i get mad love but i detest the labor
and its wages you know death
im servin life from this gift of god
dont forget your potholders my niggas more hot shit

a short time later


mf doom  impostas


the supervillian versus the golddigger
doom mildmannered old nigga
supporter for the daily blues
reporter for the jewel drop news pop israeli tools

the worldrenowned master of word game
who lay low sometime behind iceberg nerd frames
ayyo mf they heard the name but just couldnt
quite place the rep if they retraced they steps
next ep who to give thanks ta
here lies the pranksta who tried to test a gangsta
the last thing he saw was a potato
from the lone nato who hosts his own late show
keep a low lab on monsta island like seinfeld
whitewine clientele connected like mind meld
i can tell they sees these styles as too tricky
theyre too picky on this microphone doohickey
mf monday through friday get money
saturday through sunday the brown al bunday
waiting for the shit youre kicking as the plot thickens
he wrote these rhymes in threed with red and blue bic pen
and to the chickens only hoes who say let me hold em
take him in their mouth while hes semiswollensemicolon
i told him words would do a nigga brutal
for not using his noodle f up and get bamboozled
he was the one to open to her up blow her brains
back dope her up or rope her to the train tracks
or he would choke her til she collapse stealsteel
to pokerpoke her with the wood and tell her be good
he could take a phrase like peter piper picked a pepper
and put it where he couldnt peep a sniper sicker repper
nigga poppa stick a chick proper
doubleplatinum oprah soapopera watchers gossipers
on top of her

i keep forgetting cant go
raw anymore
i keep forgetting rappers is
impostas  been a showstopper since a hohopper

never came second place in a neckandneck race
to the naked face who wanna battle bring a neck brace
we supply the insult to injury
whoever in the industry getting money is too stingy
violate you might as well smoke me loc
relocate migrate or get caught with the okeydoke
its guaranteed its your last step so step to me
with the uzi watch that first stepits a doozy
time flies as the hourglass trickles sand
one last thing before i blao this popsicle stand
a rolling stone and thats that  at home
on the microphone like thats where he laid his hat at

i keep forgetting
keep making dough
i keep forgetting
mad flow mf metal face hoes
i keep forgetting
factual stacks at shows
i keep forgetting
worldwide cross the globe let the beat rock


flatbush born mingled with the children of the corn
performed got in the game eight years before lost in the storm
remember st james gates and green odd hurdle
got a few chips relocated to waverly and myrtle
model chicks on willoughby fulton is straight estee lauder
spike lees up the street guru and primos up the corner
easy mo bee was being more easy on clinton
got my lg niggas with luggage straight tripping
i think masta ace was over there on lafayette
daddyo was in bed stuy created the sonic of stet
in marcy there was the jaz while kane was on lewis ave
im from vanderveer where niggas here dont take out the trash
we dont rap for nothing were all about hush cash
as a youth with a furrowed brow taking your bus pass
peace to star and buc in crown heights with a smoke shop
or my nigga freeze in bushwick with all that spanish chocha

well after coming from a battle krs won
not for cash money all for a charity that the rev run
seen dmc coming from eps md
just bought tea the product gb from gmc
hopped on the train seen lil wayne kick it
for a few minutes he came from the hieroglyphics exhibit
down there its helter skelter someone bucked shots
it was held at the galleria by me and the x of sadat
dr dre arrived too late someone left with a scratch
one person was maced another with a scarred face
corrupt cops began to snoop questioned slum villagers
the only clue they had was a timberland and dazs dillinger
def squad heard nothing royce didnt talk
described the gunman fiftynine on the police report
they lied he had an alibi drove to cypress hill
where jalil sold cannabis and ecstacy pills
when the cops rolled up doors locked heads fled
someone said larry you shot up the spot with the dead prez
pointed to suave house appoint 
saw the cops larrys adidas shells sped like dtwelves
jakes chased lost him and they tried to get details
they saw pete rock he quickly answered he didnt see l
in larrys crib found a safe no key to the locks
opened it there was a bomb three seconds left on the clock

so there you go sound like someone you know
got you thinking he gon hook you up and help you blow
but then you dont so now youre broke
spent time in the studio lost all your dough
you feeling low taking your daily throw
dont recoup that advance then its them you owe
without a hot song and you cant get a show
in this business its not the talent its who you know

the supervillains the name still in the game the same biz
whats his face told yall what the name of the game is
downtown on the skipstop crisp new timbs
damage on my corns like flip flops and whos him
rap cats act brave as hell
get on the mic and turn gangster on some yeah see like dave chappelle
more like screech saved by the bell
black man on some im a mans man mans man name is shaq man
then they get on the first year later
get their first hater their first pair of gators
to the perpetrators hes the unknown comic
who spit on the microphone in chunks of thrown vomit
its just a shame bust this aim
lust for fame crushed his frame like whats his name
and whatchamacallit remind him of minime
with minnie mouse in gucci from her coochie to her skinny knee
like thirteen earthlings cool hand luke
who dropped jewel and influence the youth like buk
all he do is puke and he in need of a speedy line
he said every rhyme i mastermind like se divine
you greedy swine dont eat pork
in the streets of new york you out of place like mork
from ork dork paul pop the cork
drop me in newark airport im supposed to meet björk
but whats all the fuss about hush up your big mouth
i sent her out to see grimm to bust him out the big house
yup see thats how rumors get started
a certified older cat who dont get carded
doom could write a rhyme on demand
and get money as if he had time on his hands
and when he not in the lab doing flows and vocals
he out in the streets throwing bones with the locals
never underestimate the next mans thirst
it could be way far worse than a whole jar of starburst
mmmm he keeps those by the pound load
emcees run from common locations like download
i think its rather spectacular
how they come out they neck bite and suck like dracula
in case you just tuned in once again
were here with the supervillain known as hip hops gunga din


mf grimm ft megalon and mf doom  foolish


some quote scriptures but parrots quote  grimm scriptures
are made from scratch my mind floats and i got
war scars war scrapes from war skits rhymes
soupedup like lentil to show my mental is not accidental
my world revolves cause its autocratic
my guns revolve but some are automatic
vision beyond the optical needed when living prodigal
sleep with third eye open or get clipped like a cuticle
conditional choices stable or critical
who lives  who dies  who strives is so political
young street champs stripped of belts in pistol title shots
heavyweight division kos no split decisions
giuliani referees this hellhole but he dont give a
fuck so theres cuts headbutts and elbows
drug sweeps bullets fly bloods splot blotches
thugs creep niggas died tortured held hostage
actions brutal beyond belief but authentic
rhymes genuine thoughts are antisynthetic
attempt to get jurassic plant shit back prehistoric
roach niggas are morbid from my acid thoughts of boric
kidnapped snatched ran off no selfextortion
shits creek they seek demands of financial portions
six million dollars nigga like youre steve austin
cause if they really love you thats how much love is costing
or death will be puzzled  jigsaw fate chopped
up distributed body parts in different states
take you to spots that nobody knows
curiosity grows as you decompose

lord
have mercy percy  bagged up in jersey but dont curse me
six million ways to die but none of them could hurt me  aw
fuck  im stuck in the desert and im thirsty  call
ing black jesus help  red devils disturbing me but ima
rise  look into my eyes  its hard to survive when your mother and father
dies  you try suicide but all you do is cry wrist
bleeding who do i believe in  looking through
satans eyes i start hating god for no reason
why do i feel this way  every day living in
darkness i never ever see the bright of day  i hide
away from the sun and come out at night squeeze
squeeze the steel tight cause if it aint real it aint right
now im up to no good big shorty from the hood
almost died twice but i dont think that i could  last
five years did five bids  i hope i dont have to do a twentyfive
tolife bid  i gotta live gotta feel the braille
locked in jail cut a nigga throat to get a cell
black doom black doom getting it done in a room selling
crack boom crack boom from the sun to the moon

big up  the jig is up  swig up
chop a nigga up but first have him schedule a pick up
if you ask me theyre all a bunch of sick pups
always seem to repeat the same stuff like hiccups
nowadays the game is all bugged out
phony like back when hammer tried to come thugged out
stop it  he pulled files like coppit
out from under the feet of the clowns that pop shit
nasty like spit the verse and go gargle
dont fit no type of profile psychological
any last words  times up like boggle
the supervillain run em like hamburglar robble robble
another one asked him could i hold the microphone
he said sorry my brother  you gots to get your own
set the tone even though hes already known
when he get the rock he rock on like shep pettibone
on the downstroke good day townsfolk
thank you for your vote and you all get a pound of smoke
the dro soon to blow  dont make em wait til noon to know
the villains been doing flows since many many moon ago


and that ended dooms plans for world destruction
and how did you manage to stop him
simple i  rearranged the circuits
once he threw the switch bang
my ability to attack is faster than the cobra dialogue fades
very helpful
and i will be careful not to make the same mistakes as doom

whats the hero whos the villain
dead or livin killed or killin who the fuck should remain chillin
doom webster says wicked and evil but yo whos webster
nihilation and outcast equals freedom thats so fast
culture in chains that be the rolls villain plays
all these are just metaphors they describe symbols in folklore
but who knows why its like this
hero hit or old miss maybe its all good
really of god but who should determine the real
evil whats the deal
fools rush in they dont know the yin from the yang
and are ashamed to deviate or act sane
from the norm they are slaves forced to conform
to really find your essence take this as a lesson
break away from the rest of them
get from the form ending like the villain in the song
find truth who determines wrong
from right without a fistfight
different from day than from night operation doomsday
its just a simple play on words
delete all these punks ass herbs
whos the hero whats the villain
the question still remains chillin
listen to the music try very hard to use it
open up and research and thats the end of this verse
but yall niggas keep yall minds open out there

so like fuck you fuck the newspaper fuck all that shit man
im leavin good evening
yo why you want to be leaving man
man dont worry about that sucker yo man listen
yo im not gonna finish my piece man not with this lady around man

i only play the games that i win at
and stay the same with more rhymes than theres ways to skin cats

watch the path of the black one
supervillian he wrecks clubs for delf
in a drunken stupor chillin
ready and willin to inadvertantly foil that
plan of any rhymer whiner or spoiled brat
who got more snottier flows than snotty nose
and holds mics like he knows karate body blows
nobody knows
the trouble i see
from the mpv fly dirty tailin the eye bubble eye thirty
for the record this is some shit i just thought of yall
science fiction thats not admissible hey in no court of law
i live to rock mics threed
the only reason i seek to stopto snuff the tv
i heard beats they sound like karaoke
with monkey rhymers on a leash like dont have this fairy choke me
hit em with a penny so we can get these peanuts
and i thought we was nuts i used to get free cuts
they locks lex luthor up in green haven
since when a nigga never really been too clean shaven
misbehavin rap stars need listamint
call me mista bent
im at where your sister went
intelligent used to write and be well spoke
now all a nigga wanna do is fight and sellhey
tell a joke
this could lead to catastrophe
bout to stop the violence
right after these last of three shots from the black bat got me at headlock
holdin on to sanity by strands of that dreadlock
she told me get off i said bitch let me set this shit off so i can get rich right quick
then it hit me like the point of intoxication
nigga come out and rock this nation like hey ox defacin
a lot of niggas out is rusty like oxidation
in this worlds strangest most dangerous occupation
but you could do it you the super like in your building
villian like trife kinder is in all my children

who grip necks of becks to triple x
he just came in fourd follow the ripple effects
and itll lead you right to him
oh snap

zoinks
this place is filled with pretender willies
one false move and get broke off like end of phillies
true believers

crook with special powers like how to tell the future uhuh

the one who might stop and talk to you
poison to few niggas who be bitin styles im like pork to

true true

id like to say hi
its  fly the odd merlin
thats quick to whip up a script like rod sterling
 bad bitch who used to whip the sterling
who see god  never see god earlin
my man grimm had his little monkey like space ghost
me myself i got flavors that outtaste most
with numb gums some rhymers is lake toast
back to you mf doom you late show host
s to the u to the p e ruh
who chronicle these times in a threed horror
 costar or in a realer drama
who break bread with stingy kinmen indian borrower
lone gunmen who candidly flip fly floes
singlehandedly with one eye closed
in a fly pose no shirt 
may see me stack the quartermill cash pay
thats in a smash way how he did it
muthafucka probably couldnt peep it past a minute


it was back in the days when i met a brilliant student named doom
hello anybody home
wow look at that equipment
i wonder what doom is working on
now ill just rearrange a few of these circuits

what are you doing in my room

youre even more stupid than i thought

give me those papers

i just came by to say hello
but youd better recheck those equations
youre off a few decimals
and that means big trouble if you use this material

get out of here


you know when youre gonna come in
 nobody will never ever ever really really know
because the more you know the more you know that you dont know shit
niggasll never run out of shit
so much shit so much scripts through here niggas never run out of shit
 its another roller coaster ride

walk the path of jesus witness if hell freezes
the mind teases reality crack the pieces
nothing eases being chastise with blood baptize
guys revise acknowledge past lives
statements will be made acknowledge me
my mind is heavens gate so enter me
my mind is the gate to hell so try to flee
both gates look the same which will it be
demons scream from thought process
enter semen child born stress
body want to sleep but the mind cant rest
measure pleasure through financial progress
when it come to currency love is nonexistent
foes multiply friends become so distant
some hope you die backstab in an instant
foes i despise disguised as allies
to sabotage camouflage
loyalty is lies
to see god look into my eyes
to see the devil then you look into my eyes
as i rise from hells equator

cause imma slow it up speed it up slow it up speed it up
metal fingers feed beats grimm reaper eat em up
speed em up slow em up speed em up slow it up
brainsick tick tick tick mf blow it up
slow it up speed it up slow it up speed it up
metal fingers feed beats grimm reaper eat it up
speed it up slow it up speed it up slow it up
brainsick tick tick tick mf blow it up

take air compress it bless it
mix loops like ku klux
mf dont give two fucks
nigga quarterback blitz popped quickly fumble
leave game with concussion seeing stars and mumbles
this happens to any emcee that wants to rumble
dynasties destroyed like carringtons and colbys
noise reduced mf thinks in dolby
chop that ass in half like obiwan kenobi
greatest of all time god straight up told me
greatest of all time the devil even told me
icicles on surfaces of sun we livin coldly
prophets be phony
and we attack we switch like the wu tang symbol
still kill jack even though quick and nimble plain and simple
pick niggas off while they ballin
and die old like stalin
yes death i hear you callin i accept collect
human sacrifice must pay respect
we catch reck nigga we catch reck
and we gonna gonna

boom
mf grimm mf doom


goddamn it
super motherfucking villain goddamn it
about to get these millions stacks and shit
yo his dip tried to tell him
ooh youre like the sun
chasing all of the rain away
when you come around you bring brighter days
she told him
youre the perfect one
for me and you forever will be
he told her
i will rock this microphone  always

i hold the mic like niggas hold their girls tight
but i aint after her probably your acura pearl white
the hooker nah as many times as i done hit it
to be specific more times than dimes in a briznick
when you broke north i crashed the barbecue like riddick
at the garden true thats the god in me pardon you
jeepers i was tore back the ho gained access to my beeper
called back my secretary gatekeeper
like i aint peep her i said darling you was stupid though
you know the super villain he is a super ho

i had this style ever since i was a child
i got this other style i aint flip in a while it goes
pure scientific intelligence with one point of relevance
emcees whose styles need velamints
and once the smoke clear tell em its
the super motherfucking villain nigga came through raw like the elements
on ninetynine plus one of them
and with a flow to pull a fraud nigga file from out in front of him
when we with yall we had tons of fun
me and my duns and them
actual true and living sons of them
dead planets and godus
throwing divine rules to come through we will over charge yous
fool and wont feel remorse for shit
except for one time once i had took my fronts out and lost them shits
scientific going berserk like red alert
i really went to pick up wiznork for cheddar dirt
to fund these experiments is where i went
obviously dead bent and spent every red cent
to rule you and still drop more jewels than schools do
or even tv news thats designed to fool you who
yeah you who hear the most grimy suggestions
from brothers with fly names and id questions
thats a secret like victoria teddy sets thats edible
thems not ready yet for the incredible
team of mcs who broke all fakes
who thought they were slaughter proof

stomping through like north face waterproof
tattat thats the end of that
after hit the bar where baby girl bartender at
i told her more wine mingling with no single mentions of
stay tuned for more spine tingling adventures of 


as the life cycle goes on  goes on

femstat cats get kidnapped

metal fist terrorists claim responsibility
broken household name usually said in hostility

pass the mic like pass the peas like they used to say
some mer fers dont like how sally walk
ill tell yall fools its hella cool how ladies from cali talk
never let her interfere with the yeti ghetto slang
nicknames of nimble and tip of nipple metal fang
known amongst hoes for the bangbang
known amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutans
only gin and tang
guzzled out a rusty tin can me and this mic is like yin and yang
clang crime dont pay listen youth
its like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
i took her back to the truck she was uncouth
spittin all out the sunroof through her missing tooth
but then she has a sexy voice sound like jazzy joyce
so i turned it up faster than a speeding knife
strong enough to please a wife
able to drop todays math in the fortyeight keys of life
cut the crap far as rap
touch the mic get the same thing a arab will do to you for stealing
what the devil hes on another level
its a word no a name mf  the supervillain

when i was led to you
i knew you were the one for me
i swear the whole world could feel you mc


i remember when last past november when
clown kid got pounded in with the timberlands
they left him trembling he was not remembering
never tuck your denim in just to floss an emblem
some would debate wait the fella ate gelatin
or he been listening in to what his weathermens was telling him
when i could feel it in my melanin its compelling
us to break them off no reassembling
no sciencefiction to no theater near you coming soon to
fuck with you frequently like how phases of the moon would do
you could gather round like it was an eclipse
just dont look directly to the bitch you may be blinded by the scripts
pass the l the last to tussle in them shirttails
all hail king geedorah the third rail
seven hundred volts holds rap to a standstill
fool ignore the rule fuck up and get his man killed
two bottles of dom got his hands filled
and so goes the days of our lives as the hourglass sand spill
and built with passion and a glass of the ze
and the lights went down and hey

and i knew it was the last day  wigtwisting season
when some could get their wigs twisted back within reason
mostly with these crimes of treason
and youll be lucky if theres no squeezing even this evening

from how hes feeling thrilling choice of flow is sick
hes the villain with the million dollar voicethrow trick
hes like a ventriloquist with his fist in the speakers back
couldnt think of no uniquer track nope sneak attack
it dont really matter how big them is so much as a nipple
cause you could have a chick with dtriple
cept the nipple little just hot off the griddle
like how he do monkey rhymers like monkeyinthemiddle by his damn self
aint no average mc ahead of me
getting cheddar instead of the probably better pedigree
with nicknames sick games as rick james
messy games scifly such as jesse james
blast i figure asshawking ass titty licker
last one to walk up in fasttalking city slicker
got bagged cause of the dirty chick with makeup
bail out quick for the seven hundred and thirty wakeup
my only backup was an acup as far as may
to when the leaves turn red and gold to nimrod earthday
all else worthless to say
and the lights went down and hey

thats when i knew it was the first day  wigtwisting season
when some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning
mostly with these crimes of treason men
and yall be lucky if theres no squeezing even this evening

its like a mosquito the much sweeter resent the act
i been bent back since my physical went back
since cultured more of my kin
and for them i keep an l rolled in this hellhole
hold your head use your head and hold or be dead and cold
in the worsest way soon as the leaves show red and gold
to round nimrod release day
and all else needless to say
wait a motherfucking minute true facts presented
the names was probably changed just to protect who aint in it
the xp was threequarters tinted fortyfiveths was converted
the way his shit was twisted ask him if it hurted

wigtwisting season
when some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning
mostly with these crimes of lying and fronting and cheating
all types of different styles of treason

villain man never ran with krills in his hand and
wont stop rockin til he clocked in a gazillion grand
tillin the wasteland sands
raps on backs of treasure maps stacks to the ceilin fan
he rest when hes ashes
ask em after ten miles in his galashes smashes stashes
chip on his shoulder with a slip on holster
a clip a folder and his grip on a boulder bolster
they supposed ta know it show when his aura glow
get from out the row when he get dough its horrible
time is money spend waste save invest the fess
the ten case of cave a chicken chest s
yes yall the dub will get ya trickles
the best ballers pitch in and rub to get a nickels
but tut tut he about to change the price again
it go up each time he blow up like hydrogen
villain here have em shrillin in fear
and wont stop top illin til he a gazillionaire
grillin stare yeah ya boy had drama
got em on a mental plane avoided bad karma
once sold an inbred skinhead a nigga joke
plus a brand new chrome smoker with the triggers broke
i thought i told em firing pins was separate
he find out later when he tries to go and rep it
took a jehovah money for a arabic torah
charged an advance to translate it and ignored it sorta
one monkey dont stop no slaughter
a junkie want ta cop a quarter ton run for the border
know the drill it aint worth the overkill
flow skill still theres no thrill
villa bill ya ten k bills in his pilla
villa when it gets realer split the skrilla with

dilla dilla mix mix mix
do a deal for kicks and get rich quick
sketch lyric bet cha bottom nick on some vic
ick from the drumstick come with the dumb shtick
sick slick hidden in a book
the only way they find it if youre spittin in a hook
listen dont look now keep walkin
traded three beans for this cow cheap talkin
hawk men stalkin hear that we hawkin often
coughin to a coffin might as well scoff the pork then
hes like worf some say stronger though
off the top jay strongbow play along bro

flow slow as mongo don juan thong pro
for ya info when hes not practicin jim crow
or actressin and some nympho bimbo
hes playin ray j the old tape
doomwell what can i say like jj in a gold cape
fill it to the rim like brim
villain and ya wont find him in no gym
probably a foggy bog with the frogs
with a dot on the guard as he squat on a log
half cocked and half baked
used to keep a full stock of work half rocked and half shake
my mistake sign a track agreement
for more gs than lines and cracks in the cement
in any event its fake like wrestlin
get em like jake the snake on mescalines
ahem elixir for the dry throat
tried to hit the high note villain since a itsy bitsy zygote
by remote send in the meat wagon
braggin mcs packed in with they feets draggin
these stats are staggerin
had his phd in indiscreet street hagglin
villain his agenda is clear
endin this year with dividends to spare here
its not meant for the seein
went through the ceilin after enterin his center bein
a new meanin to sales through the roof
guaranteed raw and saw his truth was truth proof
its the return of the tramp
who do a duet jam when ernest goes to camp
for the right earn  namean like vern
we need some more oil for the machines to burn learn
jiminy crickets
he gets lucky like winnin free tickets off simplylyrics
one mans waste is another mans soap
sons fan base know the brotha mans dope
a real weirdo with a bugged rare flow
and the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow
he wears a mask so the charge wont grab
on a rooftop with a large stone slab
heads up talk white and thought niggerish
refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorish
black licorice and equally as yucky
how he handled the money was strictly dan stuckie
monkey hustle man on fire
later for the date than the hadron collider
and cost more it be seemin like a style
doom leave the competition steamin like a pile
smile ding sparklin jewels
in effect like alternate side of the street parkin rules
fools the roach was never dead
live for a week then dehydrate with a severed head
instead it was depicted as flicked in
split the wicks lit

endin this year with dividends to spare here
its not meant for the seein
went through the ceilin after enterin his center bein
a new meanin to sales through the roof
guaranteed raw and saw his truth was truth proof
its the return of the tramp
who do a duet jam when ernest goes to camp
for the right earn  namean like vern
we need some more oil for the machines to burn learn
jiminy crickets
he gets lucky like winnin free tickets off simplylyrics
one mans waste is another mans soap
sons fan base know the brotha mans dope
a real weirdo with a bugged rare flow
and the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow
he wears a mask so the charge wont grab
on a rooftop with a large stone slab
heads up talk white and thought niggerish
refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorish
black licorice and equally as yucky
how he handled the money was strictly dan stuckie
monkey hustle man on fire
later for the date than the hadron collider
and cost more it be seemin like a style
doom leave the competition steamin like a pile
smile ding sparklin jewels
in effect like alternate side of the street parkin rules
fools the roach was never dead
live for a week then dehydrate with a severed head
instead it was depicted as flicked in
split the wicks lit
can you dig it
we have got to try and find doom
good luck

villain is willy nilly
live in stereo
want you to call me at that address if im still there then ill make sure you get the crack
doom has taken over every continent meanwhile back in space doom continues to search for colleagues
and your name
khan is my name khan nothing else khan
as the funky beat continues a rock steady
we have got to try to find doom
good luck
time to get the feta
