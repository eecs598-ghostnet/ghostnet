wolves in sheep clothin they roll in herds
from the dirt so we chose to splurge
im most concerned with gettin money fuckin bitches and smokin herb

im trainin mics like cus damato while fuckin models
stuffin hollows and blowin dracos labeled the russian drago


you know theres some things in life you just gotta live with man you know what im saying
some choices that we make you just gotta live with you know
some of those choices still haunt me though
let me explain

aiyo i laid there for a while
that was the first chance that i had to speak to my aborted child
he said i dont like the way that you did my mother
why did i have to suffer because you didnt love her
mustve had it confused from how you kissed and hugged her
me and your other son will always be distant brothers
i dont got love for you anymore
see i loved my life what you ruined it for
how could you get rid of me when you knew i was yours
for something that i had nothing to do with at all
so what if mamma was a whore and she wasnt your wife
why would you fuck her raw if she wasnt your type
now i gotta suffer for mamma mistakes
she was a black girl lost so can i get a break
now you can judge my mother but dont judge me
how could you love my brother but dont love me

to my aborted child
how could you not consider yourself a deadbeat
you took care of one child and never fed me
to my aborted child
how could you not consider yourself a loser
its cause of you i aint got no future

i was just a few days shy of my nineteenth birthday when i heard the words youre pregnant
i figured that this meant i needed to decide if i wanted to become a mother not realizing that i already was
i chose abortion because wellmeaning loved ones encouraged it or offered no alternatives
i didnt think that i would be able to finish college
i was ashamed to be pregnant outside of marriage
it was so easy to believe the lies that what would be removed was simply a piece of tissue that by having it removed i could easily go on with my life never looking back

new york new york the city that never sleeps
bodies covered in white sheets are layin in the streets
shit gets deep as we creep up the block by the kids slangin rocks
and holdin glocks stolen from the cops to get props
you gotta split a top on the regular
or get plugged in your mug from a slug by your competitor
gunshots echo throughout the city like thunder no wonder
another brother six feet under
you know it aint no jokin when the streetlights are broken
so keep your eyes open or get ready for a smokin loc
step out of line i hope you got your nine gun son
the smith and wess you better press nine hundred and eleven word up
or make a run for it theres too many to tackle
the big applell put your ass on ice like a snapple
so even though i rap i gots to stay strapped
niggas act up i back up piyah
i bust a cap inside your fuckin hat
dont even pose with them hoes the swinger that you chose
just might be down with the foes only the shadow knows
and aint no lollipop lollipop over here only the shottie pops
boom now just sit back and watch the bodies drop
the younger gunmen got the bigger niggas runnin
the shorties what the shorties what the shorties are comin
to push a nigga wig back and leave his ass flat on his back
the motherfuckin ghetto knows and its like that

yo you gotta go you gotta go you gotta go
and aiyyo what you dont know believe the ghetto knows

todays headlines another nigga dead

ramshacked the shack disclouse bout two kilos of dope
two ounces of cokes caught in the pocket of his coat
so another brother caught the ultimate surprise
with blown out brains to drop stains on his eyes
dazed as i sit back and watch the channel two news
watchin his family goin through all the boohoos
you lose like an ill street the blues are gettin deeper
nothin left in the room except for him the grim reaper
police will take a few snapshots scoop up some blooddrops
pull out a file on a juvenile child of mugshots
the cops knew he fell victim to laws on the street
so they just pull out the white sheets to cover up the dead meat
seal off the area with yellow tape draw the white
chalk around the body now the party has to motivate
one more outlaw was murdered on the scene for the green
died at the age of seventeen

yo you gotta go you gotta go you gotta go

wasnt rockin girbauds i barely had clothes and when it snowed
and temperatures droppin below zero you know i froze
no cds a black and white tv

with a hanger for the antenna
turned channels with some pliers
had nothin in my cabinet but cans of raid
im knockin on my neighbors door
to borrow a cup of sugar for my koolaid
i wasnt freshly dipped my gear was straight ripped
im trippin cause my winter coat got lost buttons
and zippers that wouldnt stay zipped
i never remembered a dinner and the brother was straight fat cat
not even a big mac black i had kitkats on top of crackerjacks
walkin the streets with the weak sneaks on my feet
and the freaks wouldnt speak i never had lipstick on my cheek
so much for gettin humped from the stunts i always struck out
the one you like says take a hike if you cant pull a buck out
so now i gots to dedicate my next plate to all the homeboys and girls

started committin murder after murder
blasted the last nigga that tried to be so fast he flipped him like a burger
slipped and became the victim of his own murder hunger
he got put six feet under by a small shorty that was younger
in this type of street its violence
today happens too often
that hit me hard as hell
to see my dog up in the coffin
people droppin a rose when the casket is closed
hey yo thats the name of the game
out on the street thats how it goes
they say live by the trigger

tap the bottom of the bottle for the brothers
keep it real on the street money and look out for one another

thinkin back when i was chillin with kvon but now hes long gone
so i carried on and wrote this song to keep the strong on
me and black go way back in childhood when we was wild hoods
runnin around the neighborhood and up to no good
started hangin hard out there on the boulevard in stolen cars
then put behind bars sellin drugs and pullin yards
then my crimey got locked up for cookin the rock up
started bouncin uptown to stock up my nigga straight blew the block up
yeah the blue and whites was on sight runnin with flashlights
on the double a fast life thats when he seen his last nights
out on the street runnin from the heat
got knocked and locked up from happy new year
all the way down to trick or treat
the two of those in a wardrobe of clothes
got back on crackin i let him whip the macks and go lookin for hoes
and then another sad story is headed for me
when i found out another soldier died in the territory
so in memory of my dog i write a lyric
straight hopin melodies travel from my mind to your spirit
hear it when i get biz for kvon im pledgin
died on one hundred and four northern boulevard corona queens legend

oh they a lover of my grandma too but who better than kool g rap
im in the booth with a biggie sweater this coogie rap
uzi clap youve been warned
put the snug to it uniform dont make me clank the nose like a unicorn get it
youve been on for a couple dont diss the forefathers
your mom dont know who your pops you probably got four fathers
im from a different era
violate if you should ever fred the godson

pimp daddy with the mack lean
luxurious suites eightyinch flat screens
we made money stickups and crack fiends
new york city certified rap king

mannequin nails headline with steve harvey
history was teflon try to stick to degree bodies
no no no bloodline pristine gotti
ill with the rambo knife plus he busting the mean shotty
weave spinning had emptying in his family
intelligent hoodlum still familiar with tragedy
one problem away from losing his sanity
telling whose situation get nasty thats word to vanity
nightmares and dark fantasies they toetagging me try to kill me
playa had a death wish she kept the best bitch
whats snapping with fingers he make her step quick
respect me homie dont play the phony
them hot shells will turn you to macaroni
shout out to treach and naughty i do my dirt by my lonely
ninja nigga shinobi
creeping through the block then walk away like im kobe
and play the mirror like moany

pimp daddy with the mack lean
luxurious suites eightyinch flat screens
we made money stickups and crack fiends
new york city certified rap king
