the fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
but it wasnt your fault wasnt in your intentions
to be the one here talking to me be the one listening
but i admire your poppin bottles and dippin
just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
baby so dont be mad nobody else trippin

how to love how to love

niggas think they high as i i come laugh at your ruler
cash money cold bitch but our actions is cooler
wayne these niggas out they mind
i done told these fuck niggas so many times
that i keep them bucks steady on my mind
tuck these i fuck these on your mind pause
to feed them on my grind did i get a little love
keep throwin my sign in the middle
hit em up piece on my side
cause aint no peace on my side bitch
im a man i visit urinals with pride
tune told me to im shootin when the funeral outside
im uptown thoroughbred a bx nigga ya heard gunna


yeah when i step in the spot motherfuckers say who that
big bun beeda but you already knew that
live from the state where they chop it and screw that
you hatin on the trill og where they do that for real
motherfuckers need to get off the dick man
fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
get out my mix man just gon get you stuck
deeper in the quicksand with no easy fix man damn
no tricks man those is for kids
kush in my cigar and hoes in the crib
drank and the twenty ounce froze in the fridge
you fuckin with pa so you know what it is
im sittin on the fours that clack
comin down candy in the golden lac
we gettin to the money like its goldman sachs
said we do it for the pimp so no holding back lets go

look who crept in creptcrept in
looklook who crept in looklook who
llllook who crept in with automatic weapons
reppin qb til the death of him
that nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants
like kanye west and em
track record goes back to the essence
smack adolescents who ask who the best is
im nasty like gas from a fat mans intestines
i pass it you gaspin for breath and you die fast
gut em like a gastric bypass
but ya nas advocates actors seem
to get typecast in the same role
since sixteen i aint grow a day old yet my brain grow
cocaine white range rov
tats on my body like an art exhibit
i did real good for a project nigga
was once a bacardi sipper
now its chandon fat blunts in the car with strippers
guns in compartments hidden
i was real young little youth a novice nigga
blessings bowed down respected
chowed down now my foods digested
pow pow with my shooters are techs
thatll bust louder than the noise that i just spit
lets get one thing straight
that my crown aint for testin testin
chop heads off like king henry viii
guillotine to ya neck bitch
im a king in this thing dont be dumb
been in this shit since ninetyone
niggas cant fuck with the style i use
your fate is sealed no heidi klum

a monster nigga and i dont really like doing songs with niggas

i run this town i aint gon lie they run they mouth they aint gon fire
they actin like they aint gon die until i let them llamas fly
flatbush to bed doordie from watts to larry hoover chi
poverty and heroine its no place for a juvenile
put greed in our heart its the green that we want
cash money is the company and weezy the boss

they say im underrated but uncompetewithable
understandable being that my rating levels are unreachable
anything said other than that should be silenced unspeakable
and the thought of you being nicer than me unfeasible
they ask is what i do ever gonna stop this shit will never end
thats when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth
got em sayin there he goes again
see now they nominated a nigga to come
and flatten everything now let me dominate it nigga run
and they be knowin that i be blackin on everything
and make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
i gotta make it what they want and wake em when i come
and shake em and bake em and take em to another place

everything and be creating a ssssituation when im done damn

they probably wont miss me til they need me
have problems with admittin that they need me lord

way too concerned to be conceited
i live and i learn then die tryna teach em lord
die tryna reach em
they care more about how much i leave em
whered i leave it
i hope i leave more of an impression on my kids
to be destined to have blessings to believe in lord
just got off the phone with my son

just got off the phone with my daughter
told her i wont hesitate to fuck a young nigga up lord
a few bitches left me
that only got a new bitch elected
my old bitch was too disrespectful
and only get my new bitch respected
thats power yes
its now or next
cant lie though i tried though
ill die tryin thats a common death
we was such a team we was chasin our dreams
then it stopped now im outta breath
now they try to tell me i need rest
and ill find love again i aint find it yet
oh but i guess it is what it is
as it appears oh shit
the object in the mirror is more near than it appears oh shit
and sometimes i fear who in the mirror that nigga weird
he done died so many times but still here
why am i here
dear life
what is my meaning my reason
naked bitches really love ones
sometimes our loved ones dont love us
im fuckin more than im makin love
sometimes i make my rubber wear a rubber
i just tell my lady nothings easy
even though i make it look easy
but understand looks are deceiving
lookin like im lookin for some grievance
cause i been through way too much dont wanna think about it
cranky bout it gotta drink about it
gotta synchronize it tranquilize it
doctor aint prescribin what he aint realizin
pain inside me got me thinkin bout me
tryna hang my body sanctifyin
im a gangsta dyin cause all gangsters die
i cant deny it you cant tame my lion
im a angry lion hangin by a string
i cant describe it
feel like a anchor tied to my finger
got me sinkin to the bottom of my drink
i know a lotta niggas think i got a lotta niggas
theres strength in numbers but theres honor over strength
i talked to god the other day he say he got a nigga
so i look death up in her eye and then i wink
its way too real

i hope it gave you chills
the dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill

i hope somebody prayin for em
price tag no mistake somebody payin for em
ice bath when my face numb no expression
whats the life expectancy when you dont expect shit
mama told me fuck the world and be so aggressive be so fluorescent watch these hoes cause they so obsessive
i dont get too high to look over blessings
never come in second make the most of your seconds
they so precious
cause if we could buy time every store would sell it
if you want me to read your mind need correct spelling

as she watch me pack
baby where my keys at
kiss her on the forehead and tell her that ill be back
her teeth smacked

i dont know who you are anymore
talkin to the man in her mirror
that been fuckin with these bitches
and its dangerous sleepin with these strangers
every night a different woman doin the same shit
but you dont even call anymore
and you dont even care
so who am i to love anyone
i know its fucked up
different city switchin women puttin cups up
gettin fucked up

and we dont even talk anymore
aint got no time to spare
so who are we to trust anyone
and thats whats fucked up
we gon end up by ourselves and not each other
and thats so fucked up

i was talkin to myself the other day
my homies call me cray my mama tell me pray
she say i need a day i said i need a bae
she said believe in faith
ma they love me either way
hold up wait
let me set my alarm
you say dont sweat your alarm
and now the pressure is on
so now theres sweat in my palm
but her reception aint warm
so my deception performs
and then that silence is awkward
like am i deaf or alone
i got a jet in the morn
and she upset and im calm
and when a woman is scorned
is when your welcome is worn
and now her temperatures showin
and i just weather her storm
and she expect me to stay
i be like let go my arm
she said

i dont know who you are anymore
talking to the man in her mirror
ive been fuckin with these bitches
and its dangerous sleepin with these strangers
every night a different woman doin the same shit
and she say you dont even call anymore
and you dont even care
so who am i to love anyone
i know its fucked up
different city switchin women puttin cups up
gettin fucked up

she say we dont even talk anymore
aint got no time to spare
so who are we to trust anyone
and thats whats fucked up
we gon end up by ourselves and not each other
and thats whats fucked up

she say we dont make love anymore
actin like our phone got our attention
though we watchin television now its painless
we actin like strangers
like we dont know who we are anymore
perfect strangers

as i wipe the stars off the windows on my space ship
call out the spirits in my basement
crawl out the center of the snake pit
and fall into the middle of her greatness
fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
shes not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers
but take her for a walk on the moon as she wear slippers
the end of the world is coming soon ima miss it
the sky is falling down i am falling for her quicker
we hide amongst the clouds then we pardon the enigma
high above the ground but im under her charisma
her sound is in surround when im in her solar system
the quiet calms my quasars the eclipse is eclipsin

talent is godgiven be grateful
fame is not a given be humble
and conceit is selfdriven drive carefully
stay in your own lane seat buckled
and sometimes when there is no music
we toot our own horns rumbumbumbum
that woman carried the future
and tunechi was born like dundundundundun
dont call it a comeback
it was dark now the sun back
hit me hard but i punched back
the wheels fell off i rode the hubcap
is it suicide or its do or die
its newer days and its bluer skies
i told myself its just you and i
then the breeze came and it blew my mind
lord knows who im there for
i give my last breath of air for
mama tell me to be careful
voice in my head give me an earful
but i got mind control over my control
i lost control but knew id find control
i let god control what i cannot control
cant control the tears let em drop and roll

she would do anything she could to feel the flame
when everybody know your move and the things you pay
she finally made all her dreams come true and then she screamed

oh no this aint paradise oh no this aint paradise

i loved her fancy underwear i sit behind her every year
waiting for the chance to get to tell her im the one she should be with
shes popular wit all the guys so innocent in my eyes
i can see her in my life she woulda had the world if she were mine
but see she had other plans i couldnt understand
her and her stupid friends varsitys biggest fans
never forget the day she laughed and walked away
and i couldnt stop her

flatline

good afternoon dr carter nurse
i dont know about this one his confidence is down vocab and metaphors needs work and he lacks respect for the game
uhhhh let me see
you think you can save him

okay respect is in the heart so thats where imma start
and a lot of heart patients dont make it
but hey kid plural i graduated
cause you can get through anything if magic made it
and that was called recycling rereciting something
cause you just like it so you say it just like it
some say its biting but i say its enlightening
besides dr kanye west is one of the brightest
and dr swizz can stitch your track up the tightest
and dr jeezy can fix you back up the nicest
arthritis in my hand from writing
but im a doctor they dont understand my writing
so i stopped writing now im like lightning
and you aint vince young so dont clash with the titan

god dunnit ive lost another one
flatline

good evening dr carter its been a long day but this one looks much better than the others his respect is back up concepts sound good his style is showing strong signs of improvement all he needs now is his swagger
okay let me take my gloves off then

swagger tighter than a yeast infection
fly go hard like geese erection
fashion patrol police detection
eyes stay tight like chinese connection
i stay tight like pussy at night

but im too wrong to right too fresh to fight
too paid to freestyle too paid to freestyle
had to say it twice swagger so nice
and dont ask me shit unless it concern a price
and i dont rap fast i rap slow
cause i mean every letter in the words
in the sentence of my quotes
swagger just flows sweeter than honey oats
that swagger i got it i wear it like a coat
wait as i put the light down his throat
i can only see flow his blood starting to flow
his lungs starting to grow this ones starting to show
strong signs of life wheres the stitches heres the knife
smack his face his eyes open i reply what a night
welcome back hiphop  i saved your life

he looks good his vitals are up
hes looking good hes looking good

soldier from the academy league of rollers
i deny being down though they seem to hold us
my shoulders are strong i prove em wrong
i aint doing nothing but moving on let the truth be known
but they talked that freedom at us
and didnt even leave a ladder damn

and dont trip if i light one i walk a tight one
they tryna tell me keep my eyes open
my whole city underwater some people still floating
and they wonder why black people still voting
cause your president still choking
take away the football team the basketball team
and all we got is me to represent new orleans shit
no governor no help from the mayor
just a steady beating heart and a wish and a prayer
lets pray

these friends they come and go
but i got family family
these kids so fast they grow
they learn so quickly now
that theres nowhere to go
that theres no future future
dont make this here so low
and we cant overcome no

you tie my hands what am i gonna be
what have i done so bad what is my destiny
you tie my hands what am i suppose to see
what have i done so bad what am i gonna be

yeah and if you come from under that water then theres fresh air

but its the progress that feels the best
cause i came from the projects straight to success
and youre next so try they cant steal your pride its inside
then find it and keep on grinding

and the f for fucking fantastic fuck if you agree
im bright but i dont give a fuck if you see me

but im just a soul whose intentions are good
oh lord please dont let me be misunderstood

whats understood aint gotta be explained
so for those who understand meet dwayne
for eight and a half months i gave miss cita pain
now its young money baby keep the change
my momma say fuck em and we the same
so hello motherfucker you got some sheets to change
and aint it funny how people change like easter sunday
you know church fit then outfit
bright pink and green chest look houselit
bright pinky rings but that aint about this
what you bout bitch
excuse my french emotion and my passion
but i wear my heart on my sleeve like its the new fashion
what are you askin if i dont have the answer
its probably on the web like im a damn tarantula
but i know you dont understand
cause you thought lil wayne was weezy but weezy is wayne

but im just a soul whose intentions are good
oh lord please dont let me be misunderstood

i was watchin tv the other day right got this white guy on there talking bout black guys talking about how young black guys are targeted targeted by who america
you see one in every one hundred americans are locked up one in every nine black americans are locked up and see what the white guy was trying to stress was that the money that we spend on sending a motherfucker to jail a young motherfucker to jail would be less to send his or her young ass to college
see and another thing the white guy was stressing was that our jails are populated with drug dealers you know crack cocaine yeah stuff like that meaning due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine the police are only i dont want to say only right but shit only logic by riding around in the hood all day and not in the suburbs because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood and um you know the other thing is mostly found  you know where im going but why bring a motherfucka to jail if its not gonna stand up in court because this drug aint that drug you know level three level four drug shit like that
mhm i guess its all a misunderstanding and um i sit back and think well shit us young motherfuckers you know that one in every nine we probably only selling the crack cocaine just because we in the hood and its not like your suburbs we dont have the things that you have why i really dont want to know the answer but i guess we just misunderstood huh yeah
you know we dont have room in the jail now for the real motherfuckers the real criminals you know sex offenders rapists serial killers shit like that oh dont get scared dont get scared i know you saw one of them sex offender papers dont trip he live right on the end of your block mhm yeah that nigga live right down the street from you sex offender on the level three drug convicted excon yeah check him out
and what you got you got daughters son what you got yeah well you know what coughing dont stop the track thats the good weed
you know what i have a fucking daughter you understand me and why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail just because the reason why he live next door to me aint the reason why i live next door to him meanin he didnt rap his way to my fuckin neighborhood he sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood you move him out bring him to jail for life and then you move in a sex offender hahaha then give me a paper haha is that a misunderstanding cause i dont understand it
another thing let me take my glasses off cause i want to see the reaction on the faces when i say this uhh mr al sharpton heres why i dont respect you and nobody like you
mhm see youre the type that gets off on gettin on other people haha thats not good no homo and rather unhuman i should say i mean given the fact that humanity well good humanity rather to me is helping one another no matter your color or race but this guy and people like him theyd rather speculate before they informate if thats a word haha you know spec before check anyway meanin id much rather you talk to me first and see if you can learn an opinion before you make one just my thought of good humanity mr sharpton haha
hold on i aint finished wit you man gotta pluck the ashes mhmm hold on um
mr sharpton and anyone like you you dont know me so if youre not gonna try to then what you say or think about me or whatever i do is totally casper the friendly ghost to me and it doesnt make you a good person to criticize before you improvise doesnt necessarily make you a bad person neither but the characteristics fall heavily into bads way haha
but since i am human i am good and bad as well but i try my hardest to stay good and some of the things i do and say may be bad or just not too good but i do try so with that said i dont fault you i mean youre only human good or bad but i also dont respect you and i dont care if thats good or bad haha
you see you are no mlk you are no jesse jackson you are nobody to me youre just another don king with a perm just a little more political and that just means youre a little unhuman than us humans and now let me be human by saying fuck al sharpton and anyone like him
fuck if you understand me i love being misunderstood haha why cause i live in the suburbs but i come from the hood bring the hook in

but im just a soul whose intentions are good
oh lord please dont let me be misunderstood
