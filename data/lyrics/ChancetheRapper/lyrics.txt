tryna turn confederate flags into confetti strings
im tryna back up my baby mama like kevin federline
heard they got some niceass houses out there in beverly
never leave where i came from
i just need me some stockings and the chimney they could hang from
photos so my kids can find out where they got their names from
christmas cards so gorgeous other families wanna frame one

nine cars and a garage and its on hella acres
im tired of people visitin takin the elevator

love me forever thats all i ask of you
love me forever thats all i ask of you

dont gifts get rewrapped
that shit could get sticky like tree sap
i gave you free raps that shit sound like free facts
which is bout as common as free blacks
stuck like freeze tag from one of these random police stops
look like the treetops soon as the breeze stops
and once the debris drops the streets four hundred degrees hot
please man we needin some freeze pops
what in the world for the man who has everything
man west chatham park could use some better swings
used to be disheveled i went and shoveled everything
tell santa to show up to doors he never ring
he never ring

love me forever thats all i ask of you
thats all i ask
love me forever thats all i ask of you

that baby is a genius
dont teach him bout santa til you teach him bout jesus
dont take him out the snow to try to take him on beaches
i swear its enough leisure in this world to get lost
whats the point of gainin chicken if you lose all the sauce
whats the point of gainin chicken if it cant get across
lost the cold hard cash they said damn that boy soft
same niggas lost their souls in a fuckin coin toss
i guess i cleaned up santa dont miss no names but i miss fatimah
its been a minute since ive seen her
them the type of things i hate to bring up just like the prenup
that shit be seethrough like john cena aquafina
but like the christmas tape theres things that i gotta get clear

love me forever thats all i ask of you
love me forever thats all i ask of you
love me forever thats all i ask of you

the first is that god is better than the worlds best thing
god is better than the best thing that the world has to offer

magnify magnify lift it on high
spit a spotify to qualify a spot on his side
i cannot modify or ratify my momma made me apple pies
lullabies and alibis the book dont end with malachi
devil will win employee of the month by the dozen
til one score and three years from the third when he doesnt
my village raised em a child come through the crib and its bustin
you meet anyone from my city they gon say that we cousins
shabach barak edify
electrify the enemy like hedwig till he petrifies
any petty peter petigrew could get the pesticide seventynineth seventynineth
i dont believe in science i believe in signs
dont believe in signing i seen dollar signs color white collar crime
good god the gift of freedom hosanna santa invoked
and woke up slaves from southampton to chatham manor
my dream girls behind me feel like im james early
the type of worship make jesus come back a day early
with the faith of a pumpkinseedsized mustard seed
hear for i will speak noble things as entrusted me
only righteous i might just shrug at the skullduggery
i couldnt stand to see another rapper lose custody
exalt exalt glorify descend upon the earth with swords
and fortify the borders where your shortage lie
i used to hide from god ducked down in the slums like shhh

i was lost in the jungle like simba after the death of mufasa
no hog no meerkat
hakuna matata by day
but i spent my night time fighting tears back
i prayed and prayed and left messages
but never got no hear back or so it seemed
a mustard seed was all i needed to sow a dream
i build the ark to gently gently
row my boat down noahs stream
sometimes the path i took to reach
my petty goals was so extreme
i was so far down in the mud
couldnt even let my light shine
but you was always there
when i needed to phone a friend or use a life line
from a lofty height we wage war
on the poltergeist with the exalted christ
spark the dark with the pulse of light
strike a corpse with a pulse of life
i spit on the tidal its tidal waves
i spit on the apple and kill a worm
a fire in cali will swallow a valley
for every african village burned
jay elect wouldve never made it
o son of man o son of man
who was the angel in revelations
with a foot on water and a foot on land
who was the angel that rode a harley
from the project to the house of parliament
and opened the book in the devils chamber
and put the true name of the lord in it
old jerusalem new jerusalem
comes like this beast with a ball of fire
they poisoned the scriptures
and gave us the pictures of false messiahs it was all a lie
mystery babylon tumbling down
satans establishment crumbling down
this is the year that i come for the crown
bury my enemies under the ground


part one finish line

im gon praise him praise him til im gone
im gon praise him praise him til im gone
when the praises go up the blessings come down
when the praises go up the blessings come down
it seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
it seems like blessings keep falling in my lap

i dont make songs for free i make em for freedom
dont believe in kings believe in the kingdom
chisel me into stone prayer whistle me into song air
dying laughing with krillin saying something bout blonde hair
jesus black life aint matter i know i talked to his daddy
said you the man of the house now look out for your family
he has ordered my steps  gave me a sword with a crest
and gave donnie a trumpet in case i get shortness of breath

im gon praise him praise him til im gone
dont be mad
im gon praise him praise him til im gone
when the praises go up

they booked the nicest hotels on the fiftynineth floor
with the big wide windows with the suicide doors
aint no blood on my money aint no twitter in heaven
i know them drugs isnt close aint no visitin heaven
i know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
like my exgirl getting pregnant
and her becoming my everything
im at war with my wrongs im writing four different songs
i never forged it or forfeited im a force to be reconciled
they want fourminute songs
you need a fourhour praise dance performed every morn
im feeling shortness of breath so nico grab you a horn
hit jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water ugh
good god

im gon praise him praise him till im gone
good god
im gon praise him praise him till im gone
when the praises go up  good god the blessings come down
the blessings come down
when the praises go up the blessings come down
the blessings come down
when the praises go up the blessings come down

when the praises go up the blessings come down
are you ready for your miracle
when the praises go up the blessings come down
