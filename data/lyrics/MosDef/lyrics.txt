bright moments bright moments always come back vivid
the fifth grade was epic citywide test pressure
the precrack era
mr schumer what a prick
attitude match his wardrobe uglier than sin
this is bedstuy eightytwo
ninth floor three tiny rooms one view
bucktown roosevelt house
their green grass is green our green grass is brown
shots rang my phone wasnt touch tone
were heavy beef in the street et had to flee
great heavens good grief
hungry bellies bright gold on their teeth
the windows on the ave look like sad eyes
they fix their sharp gaze on you when you pass by
and if you dare to stand you can see em cry
you can watch em scowl feel em prowl
while theyre steady sizing every inch about you
fast math measuring what you amount to
the laughter the screams
the numeral the song of songs the book of dreams
ends dont meet where the arms cant reach
mean streets even when its free it aint cheap
ongoing saga terminal diagnosis
basic survival requires super heroics
no space in the budget for a cape
assume you gotta fly by night to save the day
crashlandings routinely happen
some survive others never rise from the ashes
watching asphalt and observing the sabbath
creates an ecstatic and there you have it
from teenage love praying in tongue
strange fruit batty boots and native drums
from hence i come so here we go
signs and wonders all along the road
some lies open some lies closed
some stretchers role with no lies at all
some riders dont know what they ridin for
hands on the wheel and their mind is gone
wherever you ride whatever your lane
this road called life is a beautiful thing
and we are alive in amazing times
delicate hearts diabolical minds
revelations hatred love and war
and more and more and more and more
and more of less than ever before
its just too much more for your mind to absorb
its scary like hell but theres no doubt
we cant be alive in no time but now
its just another shot to the heart
its just a sure shot in the dark
its just another place in the stars
wonders on every side life in marvelous times
life in marvelous times
hey the ecstatic
the temperatures rising everywhere
all over the world you can feel it
all over the world feel it
spirits rise everywhere
its just a sure shot to the heart
its just a sure shot in the dark
its just another place in the stars
wonders on every side life in marvelous times
life in marvelous times
now always


peace

power
uh
mad liberator
def operator
rock the data
amazin flavor

the way i feel sometimes its too hard to sit still
things are so passionate times are so real
sometimes i try and chill mellow down blowin smoke
smile on my face but its really no joke
you feel it in the streets the people breathe without hope
they goin through the motion they dimmin down their focus
the focus gettin clear and the light turn sharp
and the eyes go teary the mind grow weary
i speak it so clearly sometimes you dont hear me
i push it past the bass know nations gotta feel me
i feel it in my bones black im so wide awake
that i hardly ever sleep my flow forever deep
and its volumes or scriptures when i breathe on a beat
my presence speak volumes before i say a word
im everywhere penthouse pavement and curb
cradle to the grave tall cathedral or a cell
universal ghetto life holla black you know it well
quiet storm vital form pen pushed it right across
mind is a vital force high level right across
soul is the lions roar voice is the siren
i swing round ring out and bring down the tyrant
shocked a small act could knock a giant lopsided
the world is so dangerous theres no need for fightin
suckas trying to hide like the struggle wont find em
then the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind him
everywhere penthouse pavement and curb
cradle to the grave tall cathedral or a cell
universal ghetto life holla black you know it well

what it is you know they know
what it is we know yall know
what it is ecstatic here it is
what it is you know we know
what it is they know yall know
what it is you dont know here it is

ecstatic en punto
peace power

so original
and always on time and rockin ya mind ruler

sit and come relax riddle off the mac
its the patch im a soldier in the middle of iraq
well say about noonish comin out the whip
and lookin at me curious a young iraqi kid
carrying laundry whats wrong g hungry
no gimme my oil or get  out my country
and in arabian barkin other stuff jihad
til his moms come grab him and they walk off in a rush
distrust feeling like ive pissed upon wound
im like surely hope that we can fix our differences soon bye
buying apples im breakin on you take everything
why not just take the damn food black bastard
like i dont understand it on another planet
fifteenmonths of this stuff how im gonna manage
and increasing the sentiment gentlemen
getting down on their middle eastern instruments
realized trapped in this crap
walk over kicked one of my fabulous raps ladidadi
arab jaw drop they well wish they glad rap
now the kid considered like an elvis of baghdad

omar men have two faces one that laughs and one that cries
ali they sent you

believe me when i tell you
i never meant to break your heart
may god pick up the pieces
of dreams that fall apart
forgive me and forget me
make a brand new start
dont blink your eyes and say goodbye
cause i know you know that i know you know that love is danger

criminal minded gangster of love
charms in your arms your gun is wild warm
worn bang bang shoot em up
tips in your clip clickclack use em up
bad intentions and a very good shot
x marks the spot where you cross the heart
candlelight vigil on my memory block
commemorate the date where the bomb got dropped
love study war no more
put your weapon away quit collecting the slain
she said you right i dont wanna fight
i just like the fire and the flashing lights

believe me when i tell you
i never meant to break your heart
may god pick up the pieces
of dreams that fall apart
forgive me and forget me
make a brand new start
dont blink your eyes and say goodbye
cause i know you know that i know you know that love is danger

if you are to fall in love
then where should you stand to begin with
and when the fallings done
how bad should you plan to get injured
and if you land on your feet
do it count as a fall or a jump
and do it feel like a fall
when the hands that pushed you were holding you up
close encounter got you wide open
heartache got your boombox going
music and vocals lonely and soulful
your back at the scene where your sweet dreams sold you

believe me when i tell you
i never meant to break your heart
may god pick up the pieces
of dreams that fall apart
forgive me and forget me
make a brand new start
dont blink your eyes and say goodbye
cause i know you know that i know you know what love is

the flow is historic they cant get rid of us
ubiquitous and we lay the law like leviticus
ten years ago we made history so they missing us

cash and carry legendary sagitarri styles vary
and its very necessary get it clearly
never scary barely worried bright and early
bald head straight or curly mundane or other worldly
no chain nada jewelry that jackers cant snatch
the gingerbread the slave masters cant catch
blat now put your minds on that
get real or get back quit frontin face facts
the old timers say were living in the final days
gun smoke young folks living any kind of way
gangster holiday greedy snakes and hideaways
meanwhile soldiers take it straight through their armor plates
crash hit the market gates marvels of the modern age
access is instant and treachery is commonplace
i sense the dangers and im not afraid
because when all is said and done theres only one
man up playboy playing the game boy
pull back spectacular aim boy
say what you say boy whoever could make noise
and ride range off in the same voice
conduct an arrangement with definite language
its pure inspiration for this generation
speak true free love
because when all is said and done theres only one
and the one can done so cool
schooling the young like rev run whose house
quote pac and tell em keep their heads up
and when the pressure comes down press back and press up
fret not ghetto world guess what
god is on your side the devil is a lie alive
the empire holds all the gold and the guns
but when all is said and done theres only

the emperor subjects and his dogs
fuck you all
napoleons dynamite blew up in his face
you busy handin out plates now get yourself a taste
yum gravy over lips seekin tongues
price that you pay for thinkin erybody dumb
green and googly wideeyed and surprised
brows and lashes honey mustaches fried bride
effort to little hit now holla cry pride
when the opposition forces came to take him back back
always gonna be hounded fella by the police
ohmeohmeohmy we dont assume
secretly you probably relate
loud lung tyrant now you be quiet
husheth thou dost protesth too mucheth
your deeds are on file take your testament is bupkis
i feel like lazarus steppin out the grave
to give reporters of his death the worlds greatest nay
it aint hear or say you can see it for your own two
sucker or get close and feel it if you want to
but i know you you wont and cant do
seamstress and lies are bustin up your handle
palms and fingertips on ultrablister
you crossed a good dude now he cued the ultradisher
shell position fill your old tradition self
machine gun ran in the pad and clipped himself
now your project sinks up leakin
hand over head and the sticky red is seepin
weepin willow goin onry ape shit
little homey onlooker shouthe aint gon make it
the moment where bullies find god
dumbass he been on the scene all along
tried to help you steer clear you sped up to the climax
the brick wall on your cheeks worse than imax
heavy child i know you wish you never tried black
dante air blow craft you cant hijack
yes but really i digress
let me step aside and let the ems clean up the drecks
extra gore soak the medics to they own asshole
i pray peace on your soul now begone
movin on to deeper brighter better and more
free


this is a song got two lyrics
very simple and plain we can all sing together
nobody should feel left out
join in this is the song people need to be singing right about now
when they tell you you cant you shouldnt you wont
tell em this
there is a way
no matter what they say fourx
dont give up dont give in eightx
repeated until end


man what was the young blood name funk crush
young blood just hungry
its no glamour its no glory
its no joke no game
its murder everyday murder boogeyman
they shot the boy
the murder of a teenage life
fire from the cold steel the heat from the brights
the temperature of flesh and the shortness of breath
the murder of a teenage threat
the aroma of sinsemilia dollar superstar
scum of vicodin cocaine tobacco leaf
ecstatic tapless fire water and freakydeekye
the murder of a teenage chief
my easy speaking is easy as it seem to be
hungry belly drama busts off easily
balloon bang pop hot as a bang spot in bangkok
colder than a pimp glock aim shot the frame drops
pressure pushed him to the earth like a rain drop
take not life in vain now how the preacher was saying
remember anyway they laid him in the straight box
dark suit and gray socks the neighborhood is all distraught
candle lights upon the news report the families and students saw
confused in awe they weep into each others arms
its murder
new absence from a mothers arm
even the warmth from the mothers arms
could not keep her son from harm
from standing where the gun was drawn
over come done and done he gone murder
shell like a bell that rung
the blood burst body temperature fell and plunged
and then the time it took the medics to come
the breath eased out of his lungs
and his soul eased out of the slums
and the voice eased out of the drums
the sireens they gleam they swung murder
telephone wire sneakers hung murder
for the black and young murder and the ave they from
i am from the block the president did not campaign on
where the dollar that the working poor slave for is made on
where hustlers stretch the yay long
hustle hard for an outpost to trade on
flip it over and make more
where the blocks are yellow taped off
young bloods is trained off for obese to gray zone
where the pressure just stay on
but the lights and the heat dont
the place where you witness the true power of street folk
and thats where im coming from people
high post low key eighth oz and kilo
law man dope man adversary amigo
preacher man pimp hand both folding their cnotes
a black fist clutching deliverance for the people
young hand reach out strong hand reach in
chop the devils hand to make the fucker stop reaching
ghetto people know when the voice of true speaking
mdef and foreal hold still nigga seein
i aint got to say please just believe it
the unerasable the black ink fact
yall fuckers know exactly how to act get back
forever black forever black never wack never that
from the k killa k thats that thats that
so you can kill all the yap murder
they shot the boy threex
they kill em all


hip hop modern time flossy and raw so selfabsorbed immature
i cant remember being this bored
fake bonanza become come real wars
bullets burn through the candy on the driver side door
long investigations and no firm lead billion dollar flow
and black life is still cheap
your rent skyrockets and job prospects plummet
ten murders ten days this summer
talk about todays mathematics a eighth an o a ki
and the caliber on your rack shit
inmate number centerfolds measurements
is close as a cold cell come to some tenderness
i heard them say it was all about the benjamins
i dont believe it now didnt believe it then fuck wutcha heard
you believe wutcha want the truth is what it is it be what it been
get rich shorty just tryna live
dont believe in heaven and aint tryna get in
and hell is everyday fuck the world anyway
potion and sips spark up a clip fade away

the low lights tree top heights
be careful how you move the traps are covered in the lights
landmines be disguised as welcome signs
ill repeat it so you aint got to press rewind
the landmines be disguised as welcome signs
black fresh from iraq a wild look in his eyes missing part of his arm
what the fuck is your problem ohh lord fake bonanza

gladiator circus world
glamour pussy pimp whole goods and services world
paranoid itchy trigga finga nervous world
shadetonic natural order in reversal world
the ipod no god zero circle world
the blowa turtle world smoke from the purple world
the killer murder world hamburger murder world
open twentyfour hours all about them dollars
pretty poison devoid choices
cold coffee and more coffins fake bonanza twox
huh what i dont understand ya
what they talking bout save they soul ohh lord save they soul
help them reach the goal peace fourx
you know peace threex boogieman dont be scared
ohh lord save they soul twox ohh lord save my soul twox please
boogieman

watch the world go by and my thought connect
i think about the time past and the time to come
reminesce on bedstuy when i was pride and young
i used to try and come to the neighborhood function
throw on my izod say a little something
when i was just a youngin before the days of thuggin
how me and charlie chims aiyyo what im only buggin
fast forward ninenow i gotta team my seed
i must proceed at gods speed to perform my deed
livin the now space and time round the nine to five
for as long as im alive paw i got to strive
i aint sittin roadside that aint harder to plan
im out here for my fam doin all that i can
i love my city sweet and gritty in land to outskirts
nickname bucktown cuz we grown to outburst
philosophy redefine us touch mines i touch back
walk the streets like a sweet and get beat like drum tracks
catch no shakes over jakes boompboomp we bust back
bring the marty to your face wit no place to run back
im from the slums that created the bass that thump back
this aint a game clown play ya james brown and jump back
what you want jack young cats stash they jums at
draw they guns back momma screams where she sons at
tryin to hunt that recurring dream of high stakes
the fourth largest first artist brooklyn is the place
settled by the judge many years ago
three billion strong and here we go
good morninnnnnnnnngg vietnam
ha back up back up back up back up back up 
yo sometimes i sit back reflect on the place that i live at
unlike any place i ever been at
the home of big gats deep dish hammer rim caps
have a mishap push ya wig back
where you go to get the fresh trim at
four on the jake got the timb rack
blue collars metro carding it
thugs mobbin it form partnership
increase armorment street pharmacist
deep consequence when you seek sleek ornaments
you get caught rode the white horse and cant get off
big dogs that trick off just get sent off
they shoebox stash is all they seeds gotta live off
its real yo but still yo its love here
and its felt by anybody that come here
out of towners take the train plane and bus here
must be something that they really want here
one year as a resident deeper sentiment
shoutout go brooklyn they representin it
sittin on they front stoop sippin guinesses
usin native dialect in they sentences
from the treeline blocks to the tenaments
to the mom  pop local shop menaces
travel all around the world in great distances
and aint a place that i know that bear resemblance
thats why we it the planet
not a borough or a prov its our style thats uncalm
from sun to the  to the lafayette gardens
white coff guawinas in they army jacket linings
yo this goes out to my cats in coney isle
friday night out in front the himalaya goin wild
this goes out to crown heights and smurv village
the nighties and all my yarda trenny browns village
parkside tennants caught thirties forties and the fifties
the cats out in starite city gettin busy
to the hook to the east to the stuy
bushwick and kanarcy farraget fullgreen and marcy
my flatbush posse generals of armies
when its time to form just call me
and let this song be playin loud in long b
if you love bucktown strongly
raise it up
brooklyn my habitat the place where it happen at
live sway and the sharp balance of the battle axe
irons is brandished at thugs draw they hammer back
its where you find the news tool crew cameras at
its where my fam is at summertime jame is at
they play big and get you open like a sandal back
hotter than candle wax hustlin you cant relax
the crack babies tryin to find where they mamas at
its off the handle black wit big police scandals that
turn into actions screenplays sold to miramax
the type of place where they check your appearance at
and cats who know where all the hot lo gear is at
the stompin grounds where you find a pound smoke is that
be blazin charm that have your wave cap floatin back
the doorstep where the disposessed posted at
dope fiends out at franklin ave sellin zovarax
you big ballin better keep your money folded back
cuz once the young guns notice that its over black
brooklyn keep on takin it worldwide we known for that
flossy cats get it snatched like the local tax
the place i sharpen up my baritone vocals at
where one of the greatest mcs was a local cat


it was so beautiful it was almost unfair
its cold but its true it was so cold it got warm
kids out in the schoolyard and playing
it was nice and calm it was dangerous

when the mcs came live out the name and to perform
some had to snort cocaine to act insane before pete rocked it on
now on to the mental plane spark the brains with the building to be born
crazy is on the track
check em check chicka icka etta uhh

strange times
everybody got their get high oh my
their get right their get nice they get by oh my
they get open get ready get primed
the national pastime is victimless crime
you want your thrill and i want mine
as long we can get it we aint got to say why
i dont mean to pry you aint got to lie
we aint got to speak when its written in the eyes
whenever she was high off the sparkle in her palm
she had a young girls smile and a hustlers charm
dying from the city where the hustlers are born
made traced murdered replaced
lifelong residents barely feel safe
and the streets offer plenty taste and little faith break it down
little face soft lips little waist break it more
tiny hands oh god fat ass oh more
big eyes like birthday surprise
super dupa fly born in eightyfive
repeat it to yourself this is a victimless crime
psyche your mind theres a victim every time
your tasty little pill your freaky little thrill
pray wont leave you still you wonder how it feel
its real pussy like some money that you steal
eww

the mathematic to acting still
the unfamiliar the warm embrace
the family ties and the strangers face
the lightning thunder the power steed
the what it is and the what is believed
the strong connections desire to need
the waking now or the moment to dream
the laugh the murmur the moan and the scream
the voice of reason somewhere in between
the one and all the me and the we
the i and i the thou and the thee
a man a design a child of the streets
the daily chore the impossible feat
the drum the chorus phenomenal beat
easy to touch and the harder to reach
the sweetest fruit in the top of the tree
the sun the moon the stars and the breeeze
im coming to it and its coming to me
im getting ready

high ground circus still stay feet stand not a chance
heavens advanced so we advance with the advancement

huddle the kindred fore the fire plugged the pig pen
thick skin rich color hard body fresh butter
rougher than leather from era lighter and thunder
warm winters and cold summers king michael and obama
funky drummers daughters and son sonners
elders and youngers to measurement beyond numbers
and came to break the gate like saint tubman and not for nothing
in this tradition my beloved will not asunder
and keep it hundred
illies  billies and googlians
the christ crack the sky in jerusalem
make the devil stop all the foolishness and rude unruliness
cooney coonage and gooney goofiness
hallelujah jumpin jehosafats my momma aint sane
bucktown black and proud you can say what you say
somethin famous who the greatest bey all day
blind eyes and liar liars do not make it fade
cool frames dont qualify sun block

them dudes too ugly to be the champ
in a language we can clearly understand
shabazz
bey is the man with or without a single fan
high ground circus still stay feet stand not a chance
heavens advanced so we advance with the advancement
enhance with no robotic enhancement and flow handsome
huddle the kindred fore the fire plugged the pig pen
thick skin rich color hard body fresh butter
rougher than leather from era lighter and thunder
warm winters and cold summers king michael and obama
funky drummers daughters and son sonners
elders and youngers to measurement beyond numbers
and came to break the gate like saint tubman and not for nothing
in this tradition my beloved do not asunder
and keep it hundred
illy  billies and googlians
the christ crack the sky in jerusalem
make the devil stop all the foolishness
and rule the unruliness
cooney coonage and gooney goofiness
hallelujah jumpin jehosafats my momma aint sane
bucktown black and proud you can say what you say
somethin famous who the greatest bey all day
blind eyes and liar liars do not make it fade
the cool frames dont qualify sun block
the coolest shades aint never made the sun stop
some hot and some not
some never chase the sun spot
black like gorgeous
divine its why the shine is on him
good morning wake up
nevermind the make up paper
its time to get right with the creator


they say that goodness in life belongs to those who believe
so i believe yes

i start to think and then i sink
into the paper like i was ink
when im writing im trapped in between the lines
i escape when i finish the rhyme
i start to think and then i sink
into the paper like i was ink
when im writing im trapped in between the lines
i escape when i finish

my pop said he was in love when he made me
thought about it for a second wasnt hard to see
i could hear he was sincere wasnt game or promotion
the entire affairs probably charged with emotion
when love call your heart i guess you gotta pursue
one hundred and twentyone thousand one hundred and seventythree my life is testament
praise the beneficent
element that breath
devoid in the form that make love manifest
i spent my early years in roosevelt projects
it was a bright valley with some dark prospects
in eightythree vendy c was the host with the most
i listened to the rap attack and held the radio close
i listened to the rap attack and held the radio close
this is far before the days of high glamour and pose
ayo power from the streetlight made the place dark
i know a few understand what im talking about
it was love for the thing that made me wanna stay out
it was love for the thing that made me stay in the house
spending time writing rhymes
trying to find words that describe the vibe
thats inside the space
when you close your eyes and screw your face close your eyes
is this the pain of too much tenderness
to make me nod my head in reverence
should i visit this place in remembrance
or build landmarks here as evidence
nighttime spirit shook my temperament
to write rhymes that portray this sentiment
we live the now for the promise of the infinite
we live the now for the promise of the infinite
and we believe in the promise
love xten
yes yes yall and we dont stop because

i start to think and then i sink
into the paper like i was ink

workingclass poor better keep your alarm set
streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring

for chching cats get the chapow you dead now
killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow
its a numbers game but shit dont add up somehow
like i got sixteen to thirtytwo bars to rock it
but only fifteen of profits ever see my pockets
like sixtynine billion in the last twenty years
spent on national defense but folks still live in fear
like nearly half of americas largest cities is onequarter black
thats why they gave ricky ross all the crack
sixteen ounces to a pound twenty more to a ki
a five minute sentence hearing and youre no longer free
forty of americans own a cell phone
so they can hear everything that you say when you aint home
i guess michael jackson was right you are not alone

young soldiers trying to earn their next stripe
when the average minimum wage is five hundred and fifteen
you best believe youve got to find a new grind to get cream
the white unemployment rate is nearly more than triple for black
some frontliners got their gun in your back
bubbling crack jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
and end up in the global jail economy
stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
budget cutbacks but increased police presence
and even if you get out of prison still livin

this is business no faces just lines and statistics
from your phone your zip code to ssi digits
the system break man child and women into figures

we all got to have a place where we come from
this place that we come from is called home
we set out on our travels we do the best we can
we travel this big earth as we roam
we all got to have a place where we come from
this place that we come from is called home
and even though we may love this place on the map
said it aint where ya from its where ya at

i come up in the street around some real wild brothers
with more than one name and more than one baby mother
more than one case been on more than one run
got more than one enemy and more than one gun
partner all thats left to want is more
while these cats thats less privileged is just more raw
less space cause the projects laced with more flaws
less sleep cause the nights aint peace its more war
the can is raw like thirsty rainy season thunder claps
on the block with your old pop pleading number act
to the spot with the red top fiends is huddled at
to the crib where the little kids spend their summers trapped
with the jungle cats lions and tigers leopards and cheetahs
for gazelle you get chased like a zebra they blaze cheebacheeba
and dominate the weaker on the street
hungry bellies only love what they eat and its hard to compete
when they smile with your heart in they teeth
and the odds is stacked high beyond and beneath
son i been plenty places in my life and time
and regardless where home is son home is mine

some people live out innew york city
some people live out inatlanta
some people got to livechicago
some people do livemiami
all my people atcalifornia
and other people got to livelondon
and everybody got to live in the whole big world
together just you and me

when i think of home my remembrance of my beginning
laundromat helping ma dukes fold the bed linen
chillin in front my building with my brother and them
spending nights in bushwick with my cousins and them
wise town and beat street federal relief
slowly melting in the morning grits we used to eat
sticking to your teeth and teeth is hard to keep
with every flavor now  later only a dime apiece
old timers on the bench playing cards and thangs
telling tales about they used to be involved in things
start to drinking talking loud cussing up and showing out
on the phone call the cops pickem up moveem out
and its all too common to start wildin
im a pirate on an island seeking treasure known as silence
and its hard to find
block parties in dark lobbies
funeral homes packed but only dark bodies
i cant sleep hardly stirred up like bob marley
marley marl played the symphony remember we recall
son i been to many places in my space and time
and whatever my home is son home is mine


some cats really like to you know
profile and front
and then the jooks go down all at once they like

come on yall now lets be real
some jokers got a rough time keepin it concealed
i wonder what it mean its probably selfesteem
they fiendin to be seen get hemmed like gabardines
cats think it cant happen until the gats start clappin
they comin down the wire spittin fire like a dragon
cause while the goods glisten certain eyes take position
to observe your trickin then catch that ass slippin
like come on now ock what you expect
got a months paycheck danglin off your neck
and while you cristal sippin they rubbin up they mittens
with heat in mint condition to start the gettigettin
they clique starts creepin like sandinista guerrillas
you screamin playa haters these niggas is playa killers
mr fashion that style never last long
the harder you flash the harder you get flashed on
theres hunger in the street that is hard to defeat
many steal for sport but more steal to eat
cats heavy at the weighin and hes playin for keeps
dont sleep theyll roll up in your passengers seat
there is universal law whether rich or poor
some say lifes a game to more life is war
so put them egos to the side and get off them head trips
fore some cats pull out them heaters and make you headless

dont get me

people climbed up in the night like green trees
they were hanging from the night like green leaves
buzzing like queen bees
people climbed into the night like space suits
people stomped inside the night
stomping and stomping and stomping and stomping and stomping
where are they going
whats the rush
everybody in the place was so out of touch
hey
nighttime is when the things get heavy
you feel alone and you want somebody
loneliness whispers desperate measures
and your frantic all by yourself
nighttime is when the things get heavy
you feel alone and you want somebody
loneliness whispers desperate measures
baby dont make no fast moves
baby dont make no fast moves
baby dont make no fast moves
baby dont make no fast moves tonight
la la la 
people stomped inside the night
let me climb into the night

im from the slums that created the bass that thump back
this aint a game clown play ya james brown and jump back
what you want jack young cats stash they jums at

tryin to hunt that recurring dream of high stakes
the fourth largest first hardest brooklyn is the place
settled by the dutch many years ago
three billion strong and here we go

good morninnnnnnnnngg vietnam
were made in brooklyn baby xtwo
yo sometimes i sit back reflect on the place that i live at
unlike any place i ever been at
the home of big gats deep dish hammer rim caps
have a mishap push your wig back
where you go to get the fresh trim at
fulton and jay got the timb rack
blue collars metro carding it
thugs mobbing it form partnership
increase armament street pharmacist
deep consequence when you seek sleek ornaments
you get caught rode the white horse and cant get off
big dogs that trick off just get sent off
they shoebox stash is all they seeds gotta live off
its real yo but still yo its love here
and its felt by anybody that come here
out of towners take the train plane and bus here
must be something that they really want here
one year as a resident deeper sentiment
shout out go brooklyn they representing it
sitting on their front stoop sipping guinnesses
using native dialect in they sentences
from the treeline blocks to the tenements
to the mom and pop local shop businesses
travel all around the world in great distances
and aint a place that i know that bear resemblance
thats why we call it the planet
not a borough or a prov its our style thats uncommon
from sumner to tompkins to lafayette gardens
wyckoff gowanus in their army jacket linings
yo this goes out to my cats in coney isle
friday night out in front the himalaya going wild
this goes out to crown heights and smurv village
the ninetys and all my yarda trini browns village
parkside tennis courts thirties forties and the fifties
the cats out in starrett city getting busy
to the hook to the east to the stuy
bushwick and canarsie
farragut fort greene and marcy
my flatbush posse generals of armies
when its time to form just call me
and let this song be playin loud in long b
if you love bucktown strongly
raise it up

brooklyn my habitat the place where it happen at
live sway and the sharp balance of the battle axe
irons is brandished at thugs draw they hammer back
its where you find the news two crew cameras at
its where my fam is at summertime jam is at
they play big and get you open like a sandal back
hotter than candle wax hustlin you cant relax
the crack babies tryin to find where they mamas at
its off the handle black with big police scandals that
turn into actions screenplays sold to miramax
the type of place where they check your appearance at
and cats who know where all the hot lo gear is at
the stompin grounds where you find a pound of smoke is at
be blazin john that have your wave cap floatin back
the doorstep where the disposessed posted at
dope fiends out at franklin ave sellin zovirax
you big balling better keep your money folded back
cause once the young guns notice that its over black
brooklyn keep on takin it worldwide we known for that
flossy cats get it snatched like the local tax
the place i sharpen up my baritone vocals at
where one of the greatest mcs was a local cat


watch it relax pump the brakes youre speeding money
youll smash your whole shit up slow down
lights be changing fast on these streets money slow down
slow down sleeping on the wrong cats

clear like a megaphone pretty nigga heart skipped the metronome
rocked the trump tower to the terrordome
poor house to pleasure domes
soprano alto tenor to baritone
mos def one of the illest that you ever known
rock steady baby you a stepping stone
smash your foundation into pebbles
my words leave your nerves unsettled
you take it to the next level down
looking like a circus clown
cats like you cant even get a pound
worldwide from the river to lakeside
my stage show stay live make the sound man stage dive
i cut fat cats to eight lives with my eight ball lines
im home fore im done with all nine
got you shook like a fault line
come all shine and get tarnished
brooklyn got your pay roll garnished
they form a huddle
whisper like they want trouble
i melt the ice grills into rainwater puddles
make the proudhearted leave on the humble
black steel in the hour
assemble my skill form my power
my poems crush bones into powder
you mumble like a coward
im mos def you need to speak louder
superheroes
get your power your masks and capes snatched
brooklyn take what you cant take back
i know a lot of cats hate that
all i can say black
theres a city full of walls you can post complaints at
all the doubters and believers adjust your receivers
i feel it you can taste it through the speakers
the three six ohriginal sketch lyrics so visual
they rent my rhyme books at your nearest home video

tell them cats they need to sit back and observe where they at
brooknahm vietnam
the heat is on
put your joint on cruise
try to rush you scuff your brake shoes just cool and relax
take a breath take ten paces back
stay on time omegas
brooklyn patrol like interstaters
take their license and their registration papers

my joints so passionate
make you peal out and mash your shit
get wild cold crash your whip
front chassis wrecked but ock you cant be too upset
tow truck got my tape in the deck
im permanent like tattoos and birth marks
third degree burn marks
driving on tracks like dale earnheardt
stay on the low like the herb spot
put a big loss on your earn chart
nice since the nurse signed my birth chart
seldom seen but often heard while your jams is barely heard
just my name is a daily word
from avenues to streets terraces and park places
stair wells jail cells penthouse to basements
arrangement basic but still fans chase it
ytwok cant delete the true ancient
apache war drum on the ranges
skill level dangerous
arrow head that killed all the cavemen
they cry johnblazing but step on the pavement
and get violated like a plaintiff
i aint shit to play with
i give a goddamn what your name is
delete it and make it so it never get repeated
believe it
tell the feds tell your girl tell your mother
conference call you wack crew and tell each other
that they just aint holding me
im mos def you hopefully
mush on before you get bust off like a ovary

tell them cats they need to ease back and observe where they at
brooknahm vietnam
the heat is on
put your joint on cruise
try to rush you scuff your brake shoes just cool and relax
take a breath take ten paces back
brooknahm vietnam
the heat is on no offramp or detour

make these gassed up jokers observe the speed law
make these gassed up clowns observe the speed law

you say one for the treble two for the time
come on yall lets rock this
you say one for the treble two for the time
come on
speech is my hammer bang the world into shape
now let it fall huh

my restlessness is my nemesis
its hard to really chill and sit still committed to page
i write a rhyme sometimes wont finish for days
scrutinize my literature from the large to the miniature
i mathematically addminister subtract the wack
selector wheel it back im feeling that
from the core to the perimeter black
you know the motto stay fluid even in staccato mos def
full blooded full throttle
breathe deep inside the drum hollow theres the hum
young man where you from brooklyn number one
native son speaking in the native tongue
i got my eyes on tomorrow there it is
while you still tryin to find where it is
im on the ave where it lives and dies violently but silently
shine so vibrantly that eyes squint to catch a glimpse
embrace the bass with my dark ink fingertips
used to speak the kings engalish
but caught a rash on my lips so now my chat just like dis
long range from the baseline swish
move like an apparition float to the ground with ammunition
chichipow move from the gate voice cued
on your tape putting food on your plate
many crews can relate who choosing your fate yo
we went from picking cotton
to chain gang line chopping to bebopping to hiphopping
blues people got the blue chip stock option
invisible man got the whole world watching
where ya at im high low east west all over your map
im getting big props with this thing called hip hop
where you can either get paid or get shot
when your product in stock the fairweather friends flock
when your chart position drop then the phone calls
chill for a minute lets see who else hot snatch your shelf spot
dont gas yourself akh
the industry just a better built cell block
a long way from the shell tops
and the bells that l rocked rock rock rock rock

the more emotion i put into it the harder i rock

hip hop is prosecution evidence
an out of court settlement ad space for liquor
sick without benefits hungh luxury tenements
choking the skyline its low life getting treetop high
it is a back water remedy
bitter and tender memory a class e felony
facing the death penalty hungh
stimulant and sedative original repetitive
violently competitive a school unaccredited
the break beats you get broken with on time and inappropriate
hip hop went from selling crack to smoking it
medicine for loneliness remind me of thelonius and dizzy
propers to bboys getting busy
the wartime snap shot the working mans jackpot
a two dollar snack box sold beneath the crack spot
olympic sponsor of the black glock
gold medalist in the back shot
from the sovereign state of the havenots
where farmers have trouble with cash crops woooo
its allcity like phase two
hip hop will simply amaze you praise you pay you
do whatever you say do but black it cant save you


i know i cant afford to stop
for one moment that its too soon to forget
i know i cant afford to stop
for one moment that its too soon to forget

ass so fat that you could see it from the front
she spot me like paparazzi shot me a glance
in that catwoman stance with the fat booty pants hot damn

neck and wrist laced up very little makeup
the swims at the reebok gym tone your frame up
is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of
i tried to play it low key but couldnt keep it down
asked her to dance and she was like yo im leaving now
an hour later sounds from jamaica
shes sipping cris straight up skanking winding her waist up
scene two  my fams throwing a jam

besides can i have a dance aint really that original
we laughed about it traced her arms across my shoulder blades
they playing lovers rock i got the folded fingers on her waist
heating my blood up like the arizona summer
song finished then she whispered honey lets exchange numbers
scene three  weeks of dating late night conversation
in the crib heart racing trying to be cool and patient
she touched on my eyelids the room fell silent
she walked away smiling singing gregory isaacs
like if i dont if i dont have you
showing me her tan line and her tattoo
playing sade sweetest taboo
burning candles all my other plans got cancelled
man i smashed it like a idaho potato
she call me at my jo come now i cant say no
ginseng tree trunks rocking the pfunk
cocking her knees up champion lover not ease up
three months she call i feel im running a fever
six months im telling her i desperately need her
nine months flulike symptoms when shorty not around
i need more than to knock it down im really trying to lock it down
midnight we hook up and go at it
burn a stoge and let her know sweetheart i got to have it
she telling me commitment is something she cant manage
wake up the next morning she gone like it was magic
ahh damn it my shit is on harrison ford frantic
my nine hundred and elevens unanswered by my fly taurus enchantress

hear me see me
welcome to soundview projects
bronx new york ten thousand four hundred and seventythree
intersection action ribs touching
new gutter smacks replacing the whole dutchman
loose mamis fucking they definite land mines
dudes with no right hustle throwing gang signs
empty in the webbings broke and underpaid
fighting federal cases with legal aids
the unlit stage tonight performing lime desires to eat
can get you in a eight by five the corners younger
i smell feel touch and taste they hunger
next in line to rep these street signs to they blunder
under wiping tears from his eyes facing the felony
these niggas wanna be pistol pete without the penalty
his last words promise me this much in death
dont let my boy live to retrace my steps
minne stay safe move quiet and get it
if you encounter opposition get a inch from they face with it
later amigo digest the day to end discreetly
sex money and boss
my ties to hear me see me
true villain
face covered driving gloves
commit by my lonely when push comes to shove
they say that grown men lay on they prey
took shorts in the street
came back and made up for that with that white sheet
revenge is best served cold
get it the same way you give it
this aint fear i just need to get away with it
son stop over here you looking at me like im lame
but im looking at yall like yall call this the drug game
grand child hosing sims
put the heroin in queens
put pops freeman on in the early seventies
i sat in rooms with money machines
drugs sitting three feet off of the floor
cover the smell of the raw
chest moves like bars scale my connects untimely
king henry from twelveth street flooded the bronx in the ninetys
three scene mvp and one accord
boss makes decision paper wins awards
see me hear me
welcome to brooklyn new york city eleven thousand two hundred and six
roosevelt projects wild rose water the plant
son you know what it is
from the moment that you come over the bridge
and if you dont ride with me
im gonna show you some shit
ima show you where my niggas stay sure on the mix
ima show you where the pain and the poetry is
ghetto youngs spend a lot of time alone in the crib
bet on the screen walls and posters of big
hustlers getting dough sitting low on the six
blazing up the ambro glow over they wrist
hop in the game knowing the risk
still down to load up they clip
gamblers with hopes of rolling the trip
but when you hear head crack there aint no rolling again
snatch the dice and everything you want is going it in
this how it happens good people bad habits
diabetics crack addicts asthmatics
searching for the truth leaping through the holy tablet
the bible the quran or the ten crack commandments
speak on it god whats todays mathematics
the five day forecast the dow jones average
the price of beer cigarettes bread milk and pampers
life is a test and we all got the answer
the streets keep calling its hard not answer
and on my government my attribute my all
so its only natural i holla black and respond
brooklyn stand up and make em all sit down
i call but no  we do not fuck around

i know the minor world would probably look strange to him
would he feel like today had a place for him
global imprisonment sickness indifference
when he said save the babies was we listenin
when he said mercy mercy did he really know
that decades later wed still be killin folks
or did he hope that we would realize
that we the first the son of earth
the moon and stars the great beyond
we black and proud we brave and strong
we raise it up we quiet storm forever fresh
and keepin on

pull up to your spot on low
shine brighter than all of they cats that got on glow
lay in the cut like they not gon know
cause if i gotta make a move dog they not gon know
this door marked private this is not fo show
its mos def what you call real fo sure
is they what you call gangster hell no
they get a little pinch and go snitch to the po
they all talk fast and they all think slow
im mos definite not think so
flood your city with the black ink flow
and my crew aint scared to let them things go
so stop with the nonsense like he conscious
im just awake dog im doing great dog
i dont play games so i dont playa hate yall
get it straight or get the fuck up out my face dog
im like the second plane that made the towers face off
that shit that let you know its really not a game dog
your grind and my grind aint the same dog
im the catalogue you the same song
so cool and old school like eightfour
the one your little mami winding up her waist for
the name that real niggas got they hand raised for
me and mini got your block yellow taped off

dont push me cause im close
to the streets to the beats
the bitches the niggas the women the children
the workers the killers the addicts the dealers
the quiet the livest the realest
and thats close
dont push me cause im close
to the edge back middle and front
strong back shit lifting it up
from the big and the small
im like j brown getting involved

and when im letting off a round dont get in the cross
have your preacher man speaking low getting his cross
tell a wild cowboy not to get off they horse
before they find out the town law is strictly enforced
its a real bad way to get your name in the source
testing the limits of a dangerous force
you ended up dumb famous and gone
your people shouting out your name in they song
pouring liquor on the day you was born
buying paint to put your face on a wall
cmon fall back theres no need for all that
its all good we all here going all out
all live all day listen when the song say
