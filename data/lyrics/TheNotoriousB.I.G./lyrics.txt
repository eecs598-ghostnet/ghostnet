i wish to thank you for your kind words
you warm gestures and your constant support over the years
i also need to share with you a few words about my son
please take a few moments and listen
i hope you gain something from it thanks
as a child christopher was outspoken
when it suited him at times he was quiet
and of course he was mischievous as all little boys are
as a young man he liked to do everything
he liked to read he liked to be with his friends
as young kids or young boys he enjoyed life
everything that would make him happy or comfortable
he would do but mostly he enjoyed being with his friends and family
his early inspirations toward rap music were
the lls of the world the sugar hills the mr magics
and the fat boys of the rap channel
those were all the things i heard in the house
even though i called it noise and banging
i know now it is a accepted musical art form
i was a single parent i raised my son on my own
his father had no influence on his decision
towards the musical outlet or career he chose
my son had a mind of his own even if his father was around
he would have turned to rap he loved music he loved rap
at a point in my sons life he developed paranoia
about death and about the dying
we are living in a world of imperfect human beings
where greed jealousy and envy
are manifested by what others have accomplished in life
my son was very very much aware of that
he appreciated his station in life on the directions
in which he was going or traveling
on the other hand there were others
who i should use the hip hop phrase player hating
and i think that is what resulted in his paranoia
if i had to change anything in my sons life
that would have allowed him to be here today
i would have deterred him from a career in music
im aware that millions appreciate his music millions loved his music
be that it may if he hadnt chosen that lifestyle that career
my son would be alive today
if i could sum up christopher in one word the word would be generous
the thing that my son loved most about life was the fact that
he was in a position to help position to share
position to give to others who needed to others who wanted
to others appreciated the gifts that he gave

cant tell me nothing about this crack this weed for my hustlin niggas
niggas on the corner i aint forget you niggas my triple beam niggas

ive been in this game for years it made me a animal
theres rules to this shit i wrote me a manual
a stepbystep booklet for you to get
your game on track not your wig pushed back
rule nombre uno never let no one know
how much dough you hold cause you know
the cheddar breed jealousy specially
if that man fucked up get yo ass stuck up
number two never let em know your next move
dont you know bad boys move in silence and violence
take it from your highness
i done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
number three never trust nobody
your momsll set that ass up properly gassed up
hoodied and masked up shit for that fast buck
she be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
number four i know you heard this before
never get high on your own supply
number five never sell no crack where you rest at
i dont care if they want a ounce tell em bounce
number six that goddamn credit forget it
you think a crackhead paying you back shit forget it
seven this rule is so underrated
keep your family and business completely separated
money and blood dont mix like two dicks and no bitch
find yourself in serious shit
number eight never keep no weight on you
them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
number nine shoulda been number one to me
if you aint gettin bagged stay the fuck from police
if niggas think you snitchin they aint trying to listen
they be sittin in your kitchen waiting to start hittin
number ten a strong word called consignment
strictly for live men not for freshmen
if you aint got the clientele say hell no
cause they gon want they money rain sleet hail snow
follow these rules youll have mad bread to break up
if not twentyfour years on the wake up
slug hit your temple watch your frame shake up
caretaker did your makeup when you passed
your girl fucked my man jake up
heard in three weeks she sniffed a whole half a cake up
heard she suck a good dick and can hook a steak up
gotta go gotta go more pies to bake up word up

get married to the game but never have a kid with it
advice from the wise slice the pies
too many schemes devised when dreams collide
teams provide war for the street to absorb
you stashed in the ceiling and you slept on the floor
only a blind thugll fall in love with a whore

uhh uhh uhh

who the fuck wanna squeeze
my desert es make mcs freeze
you wakin up in cold sweats they just dreams

analyzin my size and your size and

we can hook up all i see is the future
disrespect i shoot ya
by the way them bricks get flipped weekly
sold by soldiers that mix weed with the leak leak
die for a dollar nigga life aint sweet
play for keeps wet shirts with experts on the creep
our beef is my fiancé about to marry it
illegal transactions in farragut with arabics

and saw reflections of my son
i argued sometimes consulted
i saw results and said well done
i thought of him constantly
and silently asked why
i tried fervently
and just cannot say goodbye
i lived with visions twined and twisted
passion so cold
and withered thoughts battered and shattered
i dreamed dreams
cherished memories
housed friendship
and promises that mattered
in the end
time is treasured
but love for my son
its everlasting

it has been said that there has been known to be bloodshed
over bread men who have bled to death dead
strapped to beds pipe bombs dynamite lead
money power respect street cred yeah
its scary aint it picture yourself going out as a hero
picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
fans meet to mourn us while we meet the coroners
notorious tried to warn us
we watched so many piggybacked off of
biggies back and pacs landmarks history in rap
statistically in fact its so sad to see us reenact
these tragic events which lead us back
to where we left off on march nineth
to come from such hard knock lives
and make it up out of em hit the spotlights
and once theyre on us this is our lives
thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
to see who can last the longest
and he who lasts the longest must be the strongest
in this concrete jungle where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
its origin which is usually originated from cats who starving
or it could just be somebodys horror that just horrifies
and applies to his persona or the sizes
in his entourage that intimidates the people
to the point that you know that hes gangster
he aint just say shit you just believe it

since big taught us niggas to think big
im been about my business since then so anxious
it aint how we live its what he said he did it for brooklyn
this i took in sent chills through my skin
vicious im experiencing the same sights as him
its what excited obie to write these poems
rolling going through the same shit he spoken
open up my eyes so theres no limit in them skies
when ready to die was a sick part of my life
palming that fortyfive plotting to pop my mind
then that crooked eye jamaican id so many times rewind
got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
get up out the system who could give him better signs
no pop of mine could top big poppa rhymes
so possibly id be popular huh
thats the inspiration i got from my nigga bi

i took him from coal to diamond i molded his mind
enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
i made a frankenstein my design impressed
backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
critics lashed said i made a fortune off of his passing
all i did was build a dynasty off of his passion
and im addressing the adolescents absent to who he is
the original king of new york christopher wallace
this is a promise on diddys honor im a father tyanna
and teach her that with all the drama dont even bother
on repeat all of your albums play back to back
and i visit your grave cause our friendships intact
an immaculate concept extravagant progress
bullet wounds left in my heart im yelling god bless
regardless to critics yelling that eastwest
i seen the game losing im just pressing the reset
and when the resurrection of you shines through an individual
lyrical enough to wear the same crown of thorns literally
imma pay homage brooklyns finest
whether its queens or harlem itll be instant stardom nigga nigga
