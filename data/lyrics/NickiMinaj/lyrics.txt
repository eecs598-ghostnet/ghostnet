youd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
i just figured i was something that you couldnt replace
but there was just a blank stare and i couldnt relate
i just couldnt understand and i couldnt defend
what we had what we shared and i couldnt pretend
when the tears roll down its like you aint even notice em
if you had a heart i was hoping that you would show it some
what the fuck you really telling me what you telling me
i could tell you lying get the fuck out dont yell at me
i aint mean to cut you i aint wanna catch a felony
this aint how to be a player you aint bill bellamy
they say you dont know what you got til its gone
they say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
but there was something that i shouldve asked all along
imma ask on the song

theres one thing i need to know
so call me when youre not so busy just thinking of yourself

do you ever think of me when you lie
lie down in your bed your bed of lies
and i knew better than to look in your eyes
