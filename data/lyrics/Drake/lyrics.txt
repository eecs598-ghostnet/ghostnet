silence keeps cloudin me
hand on my heart
and i i wish time never mattered

yeah stylin though
dissin but got pictures with me smilin though
all the things you need you still want problems though
all the things i know i still been silent though
yeah used to be at silvercity indigo
used to be in lunchroom playin dominoes
i dont want to have to go to funerals
i gotta start sleepin at the studio
i dont have no time to be no romeo
all the love i need is at the rodeo
all the love i need is here at ovo yeah
all the girls i know are there with e and tho
who knows where i end up when that shit gets old
maybe it never gets old and thats just how it goes
last table left in carbone callin plays on the rotary phone
i take a glass of domina to go with me home
might move our annual shit to the dome
i need forty thousand people to see what im on
yeah ducked a lot of spiteful moves
i was an angry yout when i was writin views
saw a side of myself that i just never knew
ill probably selfdestruct if i ever lose but i never do
steady doin double shifts
oneda doin the beat and i open up like a double click
more blessings because im generous
thirtyseater plane for like ten of us
remember when i bought sealey the fake chanel wallet
she knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
nowadays when we catchin up we just laugh about it
cant describe what my life is like when she asks about it
scary whenever i close my eyes at night
wakin up to public statements about my private life
i can never sleep til mornin on all my quiet nights
but you can rest assure that my mind is right
get no sick days i leave for like three months in six days
never stick around to see shit change
get lil updates texts in my inboxes have been poppin
seasons go by like im bingewatchin
went from club palazzo in the bridge to club liv
to not even showin up at a club less we doin bis
i cant even party while a nigga pursuin this
distractions will do you in in the truest sense
especially people that want to lecture me
and frame it like they just want the best for me
or they check for me whatever splits it up
so theres more for them and theres less for me
they dont know they got to be faster than me to get to me
no ones done it successfully
sevenam in germany cant believe that they heard of me
last verse that i gotta do is always like surgery
always tryin to let go of anything thatll burden me
thats the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
last chance i get to make sure that you take it personally
take this shit to heart its always executed perfectly
if we do a song its like takin my kids to work with me
you overnight celebrity you one day star
swear i told you that im in this bitch for eternity
i am a reflection of all of your insecurities
behind closed doors a lot of six god worshipping
done talk now cause theres other shit thats concernin me
theres real ones around me
i want to make sure they learn from me
i want to see my dog but his grandmothers his surety
he cant even dip out to see me in an emergency
my life is centered round competition and currency
takin summer off cause they tell me i need recovery
maybe gettin back to my regular life will humble me
ill be back in two thousand and eighteen to give you the summary
more life

least do i get an invitation or something
a statement or something
ask about that you would say it was nothing
but heres another nothing that you made into something
cant just leave it off that way


i dont care what society thinks theyre nothing anyway theyre no better than me out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebodys already laid out for you life we live you have to set your own patterns your own ideals you have to handle the whole job yourself yeah

no snow tires the range slipslide like trick daddy and trina
oli north pull in like ten million a season
queen street visions that nobody believed in
if we not on the charts my xo niggas eatin
fiftytwo consecutive weekends shout out to weeknd
the city gets stronger when everybody is speakin
not when everybody out here beefin
we got it now we just gotta keep it
americas most wanted man im still on the run
all these number ones and we still not the ones
no hard feelings but ill still get you spun
went and got diplomas and we still goin dumb
please never label niggas who lay down for a livin
my competition its beyond offensive
im in it for the glory not the honor mention
not tryna be fourth and inches im tryna go the distance
yeah distance im on a different mission
this the remix to ignition hot and fresh out the kitchen
how you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches
too overly ambitious too late to fix it
too late for condolences when its over with
i need to start sayin shit when i notice it
be open with people i need some closure with
be honest with myself and take ownership
opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
i really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
excitin times revitalized
trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
im just takin what god will give me
grateful like jerry bob and mickey
better attitude well see where it gets me
i know catchin flies with honey is still sticky
i wrote the book on worldclass finesses
and tasteful gestures and makin efforts
and never placin second
and even better knowin youre first but then takin second
inspirin and never takin credit
i know i deserve more i just never said it
two middle fingers as i make a exit yeah

did i lose you
did i did i
did i lose you
did i did i
did i lose you

winnin is problematic
people like you more when you workin towards somethin
not when you have it
way less support from my peers
in recent years as i get established
unforgivin times but fuck it i manage
why is my struggle different than others
only child thats takin care of his mother
as health worsens and bills double
thats not respectable all of a sudden
i dont get a pat on the back for the come up
what do you see when you see me
when did all the things i mean
from the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning
maybe i share it with too many people
back then it used to just feel like our secret
back when i would write and not think about how they receive it
i be tryna manifest the things i needed
and look now i mean its hard to believe it even for me
but youre mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
how they go from not wantin me at all
to wantin to see me lose it all
things get dark but my aura just starts glowin
im overcome with emotions
ones i cant access when im stoned sober
jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
i could only speak what i know of
man we wrote the book on calculated thinkin
and icy heineken drinkin and rival neighborhoods linkin
and puttin your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin
all you did was write the book on garbageass rollies
ego strokin picture postin
claimin that youd do it for motivational purposes only
but you just had to show me
see i know cause i study you closely
i know when someone lyin
i notice people standin for nothin and gettin tired
i know what were both thinkin even when youre quiet
sometimes i gotta just make sure that i didnt lose you

did i did i
did i lose you
did i did i
did i lose you

you know hun im a bit concerned about this negative tone that im hearing in your voice these days i can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust but that attitude will just hold you back in this life and youre going to continue to feel alienated give some thought to this because im confident in you and i know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation im hearing in your tone these days when others go low we go high


your heart is hard to carry after dark
youre to blame for what we could have been
cause look at what we are
your friends are scared to tell you you went too far
funny that its always been all about you from the start

if you had my love
and i gave you all my trust
would you comfort me
and if somehow you knew
that your love would be untrue
would you lie to me
if you had my love
and i gave you all my trust
would you comfort me
and if somehow you knew
that your love would be untrue
would you lie to me

out of body

why second guess i should have stayed
you say the word im on the way

why second guess i should have stayed
cause you know whats on my mind tonight

if you had my love
and i gave you all my trust
would you comfort me
and if somehow you knew
that your love would be untrue
would you lie to me
if you had my love
and i gave you all my trust
would you comfort me

baby dont worry i know that they got me


yeah yeah oh you gotta love it
oh you gotoh you gotta love it
i heard what circulated lets get to the bottom of it
i told oneda send me something and i got it covered
somehow i always rise above it
why you think i got my head in the clouds
on my last album cover
the game is all mine and im mighty possessive
lil wayne could not have found him a better successor
every shot you see them take at me they all contested
allen iverson shoe deal these niggas all in question
last night i went to sleep wanting more
tried to decide what direction i should go towards
some nights i wish i could go back in life
not to change shit just to feel a couple things twice
twentyeight at midnight wonder whats next for me
longevity wonder how long theyll check for me
prolly forever if i stay in my zone
i speak on this generation but cant change it alone
i heard a little little homie talking reckless in vibe
thats quite a platform you chose
you shouldve kept it insideoh you tried
its so childish calling my name on the world stage
you need to act your age and not your girls age
it gets worse by the annual my careers like a howto manual
so i guess its understandable man
oh you gotta love it you gotta love it yeah
i know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get em
to show they outfits off guess they need the attention
i remember when it used to be music that did it
but then again times have changed man who are we kiddin
im managed by my friends that i grew up with
id rather give that fifteen to people i fuck with
if me and future hadnt made it with this rappin
we prolly be out in silicon tryna get our billions on
but here we are yeah
lately i feel the haters eatin away at my confidence
they scream out my failures
and whisper my accomplishments
bitches alter my messages like we had words
and stories bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
bitter women im overtextin are pmsing
crazy this yearfuckin with my image
ive been tryna reach the youth so i can save em this year
fuck it i guess i gotta wait til next year
and i heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
bout how we need protection from those protectin the block
nobody lookin out for nobody
maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
instead of bein somebody that makes the news
so everybody can tweet about it
and then they start to rip about it
and four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
damn i just had to say my piece about it
oh you gotta love itbut they scared of the truth
so back to me showin out in public thats a hotter subject
ive been whippin mercedes and nigga try to budget
i gotta make it back to memphis to check on my cousins
shout out to ashley tasha bianca
julia ericka southern america
part of my heritage pardon my arrogance
part in my hair again thats that comeback flow
comeback flow once i start its apparent
im with girl whose ass is so big thats partly embarrassin
but fuck all the blushin and fuck your discussions
and fuck all the judgement
your content so aggressive lately whats irkin you
shit is gettin so personal in your verses too
i wanna prove that im number one over all these niggas
bein number two is just being the first to lose
my city dictated music nobody seein us
winter here already but somehow im heatin up
been observin the game and felt like ive seen enough
lets drop a tape on these niggas then well see whats up
yeah boy you rappin like you seen it all
you rappin like the throne should be the three of yall
best i ever had seems like a decade ago
decadent flow and i still got a decade to go
oh please take it ease wheres the love and the peace
why you rappin like you come from the streets
i got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
and im never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
phantom slidin like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
i cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
special order for anybody thats comin for me
shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
you see they got me back talkin like its just forty oli and me
cuttin all loose ends i be the barber for free
im almost at four minutes going off on the beat
feel like im in the malibu that had the cloth on the seats
man oh you gotta love it
and on top of that its getting harder to eat
rappers downgrading houses putting cars on the lease
to think labels said they had a problem marketing me
and now its everybody else thats getting hard to believe
but man oh you gotta love it

back when we couldnt buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
feel like we go back a century run in the store for centuries
then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it
he was wavy doin mixtapes out of your basement
he let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
we probably wouldve got in less trouble just goin with him
feel like i never say much but man theres a lot to know
feel like the difference between us really startin to show
im lookin at they first week numbers like what are those
i mean you boys not even coming close
i gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
you number one and im eddie murphy we tradin places
look in the mirror im closer than i really appear
creepin like chilli without the tender love and care
no tender love and care no love and affection
i got a price on my head but theres a risk to collect it
i might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
feel like they wanted me dead but couldnt pull it together
yeah but here we are and its a new semester
forty the only one that know how i deal with the pressure
a couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin
a lot of problems that cant be fixed with a conversation

you dont be workin like how we be workin
you platinum like wrappers
on hersheys boy that shit is worthless
you get the message over and over like it was urgent
and then act like you aint heard it when you see me in person
the only thing i did to end up here was put the work in
and did it with a purpose
used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships

how do you not check on me when things go wrong
guess i shouldve tried to keep my family closer
much closer
all of my lets just be friends are friends i dont have anymore
guess thats what they say you need family for
cause i cant depend on you anymore

always saw you for what you couldve been
ever since you met me
like when chrysler made that one car that looked just like the bentley
i always saw you for what you couldve been
and even when its business with you its personal again
i knew you before you made ends meet and now were meeting our end

and its all because you chose a side
youre supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
guess it wasnt time yeah
and of course you went and chose a side that wasnt mine

youre so predictable i hate people like you
kennedy road taught me not to trust people like you
how you supposed to figure out what im going through
you cant even figure out whats going on with you
you judge me fore you met me yeah it figures
i make all the players anthems for the real niggas
with my dad out in tennessee is where i belong
out here in la i dont know whats going on
i dont know whats going on

and its all because you chose a side
youre supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
guess it wasnt time yeah
and of course you went and chose a side that wasnt mine

you sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
my luck is a sure thing cause im living right
when i needed you you couldnt give me any advice
but you always had something to say every other time
everybody that i met on the way tries to get in the way
im fooding and serving them all like im working for minimum wage
someone up there must just love testing my patience
someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
forgiveness for your ways
if i ever loved ya ill always love ya thats how i was raised
same way im right here still feeling the way
same way im realizing on a day to day that

all of my lets just be friends are friends i dont have anymore
how do you not check on me when things go wrong
guess i shouldve tried to keep my family closer
much closer
all of my lets just be friends are friends i dont have anymore
guess thats what they say you need your family for
cause i cant depend on you anymore
much closer

anytime people want to start problems
its like for real are you dumb

you could thank me now go head
thank me later yeah i know what i said
but later doesnt always come so instead
its okay you could thank me now

mahalo from the hardest act to follow
lately ive been drinking like theres a message in a bottle
alohas to women with no ties to men
that i know well that way there are no lies
you can thank me now for all the info i give to you niggas
im on the brink of influential im here for you niggas
i guess a hit doesnt add up to a career for you niggas
i must have been hard to watch what a year for you niggas
its december thirtyonest and we in miami just meditating
you got your resolutions we just got reservations
living out a dream it feels like i stayed up
and we just want to party patron straight up
fuck that old shit im on new things
ovo clique red wing boot gang
yeah we want it all half was never the agreement
who would have thought the route wed chosen
would ever end up the scenic
i can relate to kids going straight to the league
when they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
and thats around the time
that your idols become your rivals
you make friends with mike
but got to ai him for your survival
damn i swear sports and music are so synonymous
cause we want to be them and they want to be us
so on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment
that you take for granted you can thank me now
and oh my goodness youre welcome youre welcome
at this point me is who i am trying to save myself from
rappers hit me up and i never know what to tell them
cause they think that i can help them
get back to where they fell from
but drink up cause everyone here is good tonight
except the niggas that i came with they good for life
thats how you know its going down
in case another chance never comes around

you could thank me now go head
thank me later yeah i know what i said
but later doesnt always come so instead
its okay you could thank me now

shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
i think im spending all my time with the wrong women
i think ill have a chance at love and knowing me ill miss it
cause me dedicating my time just isnt realistic
man the good girls went silent on me
they got a boyfriend or left for college on me
and all the bad ones i used to hit are friends now
that make me wish i had a little less mileage on me
but do i ever come up in discussion
over double pump lattes and low fat muffins
do i or is missing what we had out of the question
im probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
i got flows for the marilyn monroes
who was there before it all i guess thats how it goes
they hear about your cons but focus on your pros
and love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
but those same ones from your area will grow into women
that are ready to get married at hello
because of what they allowed where are they all now
i know theyre somewhere watching
so im trying to make them proud
searching for the meaning youll find it next to me
they tell me im the hottest guess we finally get to see
im feeling like nas who am i to disagree
they say the doors will open up
soon as you find the missing key
thats probably why im in this bitch shining
jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
i rep the atf in case you need to be reminded
and the bandwagons full
but you can try and run behind it im sorry
poolside drinking margarita rounds
shout out to my city though i hardly be in town
im the black sheep but chris farley wears the crown
and i know life is just a game
in which the cards are facing down
im in a world where things are taken never given
how long they choose to love you will never be your decision
and im aware that this could be the last time you listen
so while im still here in this position

you could thank me now go head
thank me later yeah i know what i said
but later doesnt always come so instead
its okay you could thank me now

i i i know you all too well
i said that we could kiss the past goodbye
but you werent excited
theres no way to fight it
you can stay but shawty here i go

should i spend a weekend in vegas
im living inside a moment not taking pictures to save it
i mean how could i forget my memorys never faded
i cant relate to these haters my enemies never made it
i am still here with who i started with
the game needed life i put my heart in it
i blew myself up im on some martyr shit
carry the weight for my city like a cargo ship
im twentythree with a money tree
growing more too i just planted a hundred seeds
its ironic cause my mother was a florist
and thats how she met my pops
and now my garden is enormous
its happening penny lane just like you said
i avoided the coke game and went with sprite instead
uhhuh thats word to the millions that they putting up
im trying to do better than good enough

what am i afraid of
this is supposed to be what dreams are made of
but people i dont have the time to hang with
always look at me and say the same shit
they say you promised me you would never change
you promised me you would never change

am i wrong for making light of my situation clap on
when forty got some shit for me to snap on now that im on
i dont really want to worry about getting back on
im just trying to stay on get my fucking buffet on
i heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
and i be acting like i dont know how to work a phone
but hit redial youll see that i just called
some chick i met at the mall that i barely know at all and
plus this woman that i messed with unprotected
texted saying she wished she would have kept it
the one that im laying next to just looked over and read it
man i couldnt tell you where the fuck my head is
im holding on by a thread
its like im high right now the guy right now
and you could tell by looking in my eyes right now
that nothing really comes as a surprise right now
cause we just having the time of our lives right now

what am i afraid of
this is supposed to be what dreams are made of
but people i dont have the time to hang with
always look at me and say the same shit
they say you promised me you would never change
you promised me you would never change

i live by some advice this girl lissa told me
the other day lissa told me that she missed the old me
which made me question when i went missing
and when i started treating my friends different
maybe it was the fast paced switch up
or the two guns in my face during the stick up
maybe cause a girl i thought i trusted
was who set the whole shit up
but in fact i havent seen them since they locked big rich up
i know but same time im quick to forget
im bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
burn it all burn it all im starting it fresh
cause half the time i got it right i probably guessed
did i just trade free time for camera time
will i blow all of this money baby hammer time
yeah i just need some closure
aint no turning back for me im in it til its over


money just changed everything
i wonder how life without it would go
from the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
looking down from the top and its crowded below
my fifteen minutes started an hour ago
truth over fame you know i respect the blatant shit
when i hear em talking i just dont know what to make of it
hate is so familiar to me im slowly embracing it
doesnt come natural bear with me it could take a bit
yeah and my dreams are who im racing with
but you can see im pacing it so that im always chasing it
wayne put me right here thats who i get the paper with
i hope that my success never alters our relationship
yeah this life is something i would die for
octobers own but its looking like july four
i just wish theyd let you try it first
this time im really going off fireworks

oh today it begins
ive missed them before
but wont miss them again
i keep having the same dream
and i think that i just realized what it means

all i see is fireworks
all i see is fireworks
every night its fireworks
every night its fireworks
all i see is fireworks
all i see is fireworks
taking off like fireworks
taking off likeoh

im just such a gentleman you should give it up for me
look at how im placing all my napkins and my cutlery
i could tell it wasnt love i just thought youd fuck with me
who could of predicted lucky strike would have you stuck with me
damn i kept my wits about me luckily
what happened between us that night it always seems to trouble me
now all of a sudden these gossip blogs want to cover me
and you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
but i was curious
and ill never forget it baby what an experience
you couldve been the one but it wasnt that serious
there was smoke in the air before that was me clearing it
that felt good all in all i learned a lesson from it though
you never see it coming you just get to see it go
yeah i shouldve looked up in the sky at first
now i can see it in her eyes fireworks

oh today it begins
ive missed them before
but wont miss them again
i keep having the same dream
and i think that i just realized what it means

all i see is fireworks
all i see is fireworks
every night its fireworks
every night its fireworks
all i see is fireworks
all i see is fireworks
taking off like fireworks
taking off likeoh

everythings the same but it feels different
my dad called me up knowing that i still listen
and hes still got his foot out guilt tripping
its been years though i just learn to deal with it
for real me and my realtor we built up a better rapport
got my mother in a place with some better decor
she searched the entire city i let her explore
and now shes saying shes more lonely than ever before
how many of our parents marriages lasted
i was only five i bet i barely reacted
im flying back home for the heritage classic
searching for that feeling tell me where is the magic
lets stay together til were ghosts
i want to witness love i never seen it close
yeah but i guess i gotta find it first
thats why im really going off fireworks

oh today it begins
ive missed them before
but wont miss them again
i keep having the same dream
and i think that i just realized what it means

all i see is fireworks
all i see is fireworks
every night its fireworks
every night its fireworks
all i see is fireworks
all i see is fireworks
taking off like fireworks
taking off likeoh

and look i really think nobody does it better
i love the way that you put it together uh

things have been so crazy and hectic
i shoulda gotten back by now
but you know how much i wanted to make it
its probably better anyhow
so if you gotta go
if theres anything i should know
if the spotlight makes you nervous
if youre looking for a purpose

you put the tea in the kettle and light it
put your hand on the metal and feel it
but do you even feel it anymore
i remember when you thought i was joking
now im off singing karaoke
further than ive ever been
so if you gotta go
if theres any way i can help

isnt it ironic that the girl i want to marry is a wedding planner
that tells me my life is too much and then moves to atlanta
damn of all the places you could go
i just thought youd choose somewhere
that had somebody that you know
im always up too late i worry bout you there alone
in that place you call your home warm nights and cold patron
i hope that you dont get known for nothing crazy
cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady
i know they say the first love is the sweetest
but that first cut is the deepest
i tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets
secrets you were telling everybody but me

it seems like everything i do youre used to it
and i hate hearing stories bout who youve been with
thats when i gotta hide what im feeling inside
so you still think im confident and damn

youre up on a pedestal are we moving too fast

brand new brand new brand new brand new brand new
oh girl ayy ayy ayy

i highly doubt this feeling is reversible
knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
that you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside
so i dont ever question you and damn
i cant even find the perfect brush
so i can paint whats going through my mind
racing against myself but im a couple steps behind
thats why i gotta ask

one time for the homie dj screw
already im feeling throwed in this bitch

i say my name is drizzy and aint nobody realer
cup inside a cup smoking ghostface killah
got these boppas going crazy nigga im the man
i sent ya girl a message said ill see ya when i can
she sent me one back but i aint never read it
cause pussys only pussy and i get it when i need it

and im telling you im as cold as windows down in the winter
and i be riding rims if my tires any thinner
airport stunting flying charters overseas
full of dom perignon and the water for the ds
dont know why it happens everytime we alone
but here we are again and i swear im in my zone
so ima sip this drank until that muhfucka gone
and you gon get undressed and we gon get it on

i dont give you the time you deserve from me
this is something i know i know i know
so tonight ill just fuck you like were in houston
taking everything slow so slow so slow
but i do it to her

draped up dripped out know what im talking bout
three in the morning get it popping in the parking lot
its on once again and i never pretend
a nigga staying g til the end

ayy yeah
i swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation you know
i just get that feeling like im in houston
candy paint switching colors in the light
its about like eleven pm and you just rolling through the city
bumping that screw big moe ugk lil keke
it feel like like everythings just moving slow
lets take my time i pace it baby yeah im gone


why do i feel so alone
like everybody passing through the studio
is in character as if he acting out a movie role
talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
and i dont have the heart
to give these bitch niggas the cue to go
so they stick around kicking out feedback
and i entertain it as if i need that
i had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
my privacy about the only thing i need back but
its hard to think of them polite flows
when stefano pilati suits are your night clothes
and jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
and you still make it even when they say your flight closed
eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
life was so full now this shit just being lipod
always said id say it all on the right track
but in this game you only lose when you fight back
black diamond bracelets showing you the basics
i cant live and hold the camera someone gotta tape this
and make hits like a bitch thats married i aint miss
twentyfour hours from greatness im that close
dont ever forget the moment you began to doubt
transitioning from fitting in to standing out
los angeles cabanas or atlanta south
watchin hovs show embarrassed to pull my camera out
and my mother embarrassed to pull my phantom out
so i park about five houses down
she say i shouldnt have it until i have the crown
but i dont wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
so she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus
but yet im rolling round the fuckin city like your highness
got niggas reactin without a sinus
cause what im working with is timeless
and promoters try to get me out to they club
and say i have fun but i cant imagine how
cause i just seen my exgirl standing with my next girl
standing with the girl that im fuckin right now
and shit could get weird unless they all down
and so i stay clear we from a small town
and everybody talks and everybody listen
and somehow the truth just always comes up missing
ive always been something that these labels cant buy
especially if they tryin to take a piece of my soul
and sylvia be tellin tez damn drake fly
and he just be like silly motherfucker i know
that was your bad how could you pass up on em
he just take them records and he gas up on em
wayne will prolly put a million cash up on em
surprised no one ever put your ass up on em
oh they did po at least they tried to
and thats what happen when you spitting whats inside you
but slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
and they think they can market you however they decide to
nah but forty told me to do me
and dont listen to anybody that knew me
cause to have known me would mean that theres a new me
and if you think i changed in the slightest coulda fooled me
boy and to my city im the twentythree
drug dealers live vicariously through me
i quit school and its not because im lazy
im just not the social type and campus life is crazy
understand i could get money with my eyes closed
lost some of my hottest verses down in cabo
so if you find a blackberry with the side scroll
sell that mothafucka to any rapper that i know
cause they need it much more than i ever will
i got new shit im gettin better still
little niggas put my name in they verses
cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
future said cause this ye shit you better kill
and i think this got this makingofalegend feel
problem with these other niggas they aint never real

yeah thats all i can say


uh
im just so far gone
octobers own
please leave me alone
drunk off champagne
screamin in the phone
see my house is not a home
fuck is going on
where did we go wrong
where do we belong
caught up in the game and its one i cant postpone
meanin if it rains im the one its rainin on
when my diamond chain is on still nothin set in stone
women borrow sweaters that i spray with my cologne
and tell me dont forget em and i promise that i wont
feelin so distant from everyone ive known
to make everybody happy i think i would need a clone
places we get flown parties that weve thrown
ive done more for this city than these rappers that have blown
its only been three years
look at how ive grown
im just in my zone
i call this shit the calm
yeah but im the furthest thing from calm
dedicated to my mom and i swear my word is bond
everything will be okay and it wont even take that long
you can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
leader of the new school its proven and its known
im sittin in a chair but in the future its a throne
i know you like to worry itll be better if you dont cause

you know everything gon be all right i promise
i apologize to you know put yall in this position vent to yall but
forty mama always say dont ask permission
just ask forgiveness you know so uh forgive me yeah yeah
say

uh
and life is so insane
look what i became trying to make a name
all my first dates are interrupted by my fame
because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
they love it when you smile unaware that its a strain
its a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
women need attention therefore women will complain
develop hatred for men and say that youre the one to blame
tryin to enjoy myself with tez in miami at the game
i just wish he knew how much it really weighed like dwayne
its a weight thats on my chest whoever spotting me is playing
so im lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain
hoping western union doing currency exchange
cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed
like how i had a rolls and i went and got a range
and he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
damn and i can only feel his pain
cause in memphis tennessee theres only so much to attain
so im filling out the form at the counter once again
he say he love me i just hope he doesnt say that shit in vain
im why your girl heart is in a sling
call me heartbreak drake im the hardest one to tame
as a man im just honest as an artist im a king
with my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain
yeah and see this is the thang
what they viewing as bragging is the way that i maintain
the shit i write while staring out the window of a plane
is the singlehanded reason i remain me yeah

uh
i said i call this shit the calm
but im the furthest thing from calm
swear im putting on
but they always wanna ask what type of act you putting on like
man


gotta do what i gotta do

all my exes live in texas like im george strait
or they go to georgia state where tuition is handled
by some random nigga that live in atlanta
that she only see when she feels obligated
admitted it to me the first time we dated
but she was no angel and we never waited
i took her for sushi she wanted to fuck
so we took it to go told them dont even plate it
and we never talk too much after i blew up
just only hello or a happy belated
and i think i text her and told her i made it
and thats when she text me and told me she prayed it
and thats when i text her and told her i love her
then right after texted and told her im faded
she asked what have i learned since getting richer
i learned working with the negatives
could make for better pictures
i learned hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
even though its fucked up girl im still fucking with ya
damn is it the fall time for me to revisit the past
its women to call theres albums to drop
theres liquor involved
theres stories to tell we been through it all
interviews are like confessions
get the fuck up out my dressing room confusing me with questions like

you think them niggas you with is with you
and i say hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah

hold my breath until my face turn purple
keep a few bad bitches in my circle
my nuts hang like aint no curfew

i flew jet she flew commercial
but we still met later that night
after my session she came over
i was aggressive and she was sober
i gave her a pill she started confessing
and started undressing and ask me to hold her
and so i did but that was last month
and now shes texting me asking for closure
damn she say this shit gon catch up to me
i keep tissue paper
we eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
she say she hate that she love me
and she wish i was average
shit sometimes i wish the same
and i wish she wasnt married
promises i hope i never break em

cause you dont say you love me
to your friends when they ask you
even though we both know that you do you do

you and all your girls in the club one time
all so convinced that youre following your heart
cause your mind dont control what it does sometimes
we all have our nights though dont be so ashamed
ive had mine youve had yours we both know we know
you hate being alone well you aint the only one
you hate the fact that you bought the dream
and they sold you one
you love your friends but somebody shouldve told you some
to save you instead they say

if you hurt i dont tell you
you dont care if youre true

i hate when i hate when people say they feel me man i hate that shit
itll be a long time before yall feel me if ever
fo real

you wont feel me until everybody
say they love you but its not love
and your suit is oxblood
and the girl you fucking hates you
and your friends faded off shots of
what you ordered to forget about the game that you on top of
your famous girlfriends ass keep getting thicker than a plot does
and when you forget it thats when she pop up
and you got a drop but you ride around with the top up
or get three suvs for niggas dressed like refugees
and deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
and you do dinners at french laundry in napa valley
scallops and glasses of dolce that shits right up your alley
you see a girl and you ask about her
bitches smiling at you it must be happy hour
they put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
its feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
walking through airport security with your hat down
instead of getting a pat down they just keep on
saying that they feel you nigga

ive been faded too long
ive been faded too long
ive been faded too long
why wont it stop the ride
why wont it stop the ride

you wont feel me til you want it so bad you tell yourself youre in it
and tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished
and steal your mothers debit cards so you maintain an image
and ride around in overpriced rental cars that aint tinted
you need a minute you got it
you know its real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
the sun is up when you get home thats just a way of life
apartment one thousand five hundred and three some couches and paintings
when you record with two others that want the same things
it start to feel better than home feels
and so you up there every night you swear you getting close
that champagne money was for gas and phone bills
but shit you bout to spend it on what matters most
you drop a couple songs in hopes that you could be the nigga
and come out every night to let the city see they nigga
telling stories that nobody relate to
and even though they hate you
they just keep on telling you they feel you nigga

ive been faded too long
ive been faded too long
ive been faded too long
why wont it stop the ride
why wont it stop the ride

i havent been inside terminal one and three in so long
im driving right up to it now

that runway can be cold especially after summers rolled on
and all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
for four months out the year its got you asking whats good at home

i heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
rather hear what was or will be than what is
rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you
rather hear about findin yourself than how you lost you
rather you make this an open letter
about family and struggle and it takin forever
about hearts that youve broken and ties that youve severed
no doubt in my mind thatll make them feel better

my body isnt much of a sacred temple with vodka and wine
and sleep at the opposite times
promise shit is gettin outta line like when you make a stencil

violatin the treaty of versailles
champagne is the alias but no cease and desist in i

billboard awards i claimed thirteen out in vegas like sureños

luckily i didnt have to grow there
i would only go there cause niggas that i know there
i dont know whats getting into me i just like the rush
when you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
he just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
you aint ever worried cause hes not who he pretends to be
people like mazin who was a best friend to me
start to become a distant memory things change in that life
and this life started lacking synergy
and fuckin with me mentally i think its meant to be
paranoid always rolling with my mothafuckin boys
but you gotta understand when its yours

whats up been a minute since we kicked it youve been caught up
with them bitches i dont get it youre a star love
you shouldnt have to deal with that
id never make you feel like that cause

i love me i love me enough for the both of us
thats why you trust me i know you been through more than most of us
so what are you what are you what are you so afraid of
darling you you give but you cannot take love

i needed to hear that shit i hate when youre submissive
passive aggressive when were texting i feel the distance
i look around the peers that surround me these niggas tripping
i like when money makes a difference but dont make you different
started realizing a couple places i could take it
i want to get back to when i was that kid in the basement
i want to take it deeper than money pussy vacation
and influence a generation thats lacking in patience
ive been dealing with my dad speaking of lack of patience
just me and my old man getting back to basics
weve been talking bout the future and time that we wasted
when he put that bottle down girl that niggas amazing
well fuck it we had a couple coronas
we might have rolled a white paper just something to hold us
we even talked about you and our couple of moments
he said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
you a flower child beautiful child im in your zone
looking like you came from the seventys on your own
my mother is sixtysix and her favorite line to hit me with is
who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone
you dont even know what you want from love anymore
i search for something im missing and disappear when im bored
but girl what qualities was i looking for before
who you settling for who better for you than the boy huh

i love me i love me enough for the both of us
thats why you trust me i know you been through more than most of us
so what are you what are you what are you so afraid of
darling you you give but you cannot take love

thinking bout texas back when porscha used to work at treasures
or further back than that before i had the houston leverage
when i got summer a michael kors with my mommas debit
a weak attempt at flexing ill never forget it
cause that night i played her three songs
then we got to talking bout something we disagreed on
then she start telling me how ill never be as big as trey songz
boy was she wrong that was just negative energy for me to feed off
now its therapeutic blowing money in the galleria
or beverly center macys where i discovered bria
landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
when i could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
the one that i needed was courtney from hooters on peachtree
ive always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
now she engaged to be married whats the rush on commitment
know we were going through some shit name a couple that isnt
remember our talk in the parking lot at the ritz
girl i felt like we had it all planned out i guess i fucked up the vision
learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
when you find out how im living i just hope im forgiven
it seem like you dont want this love anymore
im acting out in the open its hard for you to ignore
but girl what qualities was i looking for before
who you settling for who better for you than the boy huh

i love me i love me enough for the both of us
thats why you trust me i know you been through more than most of us
so what are you what are you what are you so afraid of
darling you you give but you cannot take love

been baka aka not nice from time g

scarborough ting from time g

and understand that im not doin it the same
man im doing it better
like i didnt make that clearer this year
like i should feel i dont know guilty for saying that
they should put a couple more mirrors in here
so i can stare at myself
these are usually just some thoughts
that i would share with myself
but i thought fuck it its worth it to share em
with someone else other than paris for once
i text her from time to time she a mom now
i guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
i told her she could live with me if she need to
i got a compound but i think shes straight
cause she supported since hot beats
right before wayne came and got me
out of the back room where i was rapping with jas
over beats that i shouldnt have in the hopes for the glory
he walked right past in the hallway
three months later im his artist
he probably wouldnt remember that story

couldnt believe when he called me

just tryin to make sure that i see him sometimes
its breakin my spirit
single father i hate when i hear it
i used to challenge my parents on every album
now im embarrassed to tell em i ended up as a coparent
always promised the family unit
i wanted it to be different because ive been through it
but this is the harsh truth now
and fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories i tell you now
i dont want you worry bout whose house you live at
or who loves you more or whos not there
who did what to who fore you got here
nah look im too proud
to let that come between me and you now
realize i gotta think for two now
i gotta make it i better make it
i promise if im not dead then im dedicated
this the first positive dna we ever celebrated
i cant forget the looks on they faces
got the news in miami that now we all got ones that we raisin
tell gelo bring some more rosé and the baccarats out
for our cheers to the next generation
but this champagne toast is shortlived
i got an empty crib in my empty crib
i only met you one time introduced you to saint nick
i think he mustve brought you like twenty gifts
your mother say you growin so fast that they dont even really fit
but man you know
i still had to get it for my boy though you know

you got a good spirit
well talk more when you hear this my g

im changing from boy to a man

no one to guide me im all alone
no one to cry on
i need shelter from the rain to ease the pain
of changing from boy to a man
im all alone
no one to cry on
i need shelter from the rain to ease the pain
of changing from boy to a man


yeah turn everything up
yeah oh yeah
turn everything up a little more

i want my baby to have your eyes
im going against my own advice
should i do new york i cant decide
fashion week is more your thing than mine
i cant even lie id rather stay inside
i cant do suit and tie
cant be in a room with you and stand on different sides
one thing at a time
i have to learn to hide
one thing at a time
emotions running high
i wish you felt alright

just hitting my line
all the time all the time all the
you stay on my mind
all the time all the time yeah

it takes some finesse
i seen you finesse
he cant know finesse
you stay on my mind

you and your sister
too hot to handle
things would get cancelled
i would make time for you
commitment
going the distance
im new to all of this

it takes some finesse
i seen you finesse
he cant know finesse
you stay on my mind


only holdin up i do is my end of the bargain
only beggin that i do is me beggin your pardon
only tryin that i do is me tryin the hardest
only problems i do are math problems with profit
only lyin i do is lyin out in the tropics
only cryin i do is cryin from laughin bout it
only lackin i can do is my lack of responses
only rest that i do is where the rest of my commas
still i rise maya angelou vibes
when life comin at you from all angles and sides
and they dont wanna see that you smilin from inside
it really boils down to how you plan to survive
love certain ones but never get attached to em
give em nice things but whats that to em
especially when another girl i flew in is flickin up in my bathroom
and they recognize the bathroom
all hell starts to break loose in my texts
i only tell lies to who i gotta protect
i would rather have you remember me how we met
i would rather lose my leg than lose their respect
but thatll never happen the way im watchin my step
that aint what im bout
im in control of my destiny never in doubt
if i cant make it with you ill make it without
they say take the good with the bad ill take it without
houston women i wineanddine and take to the house
my moral compass is janky it breaks in the south
is there more to life than digits and bankin accounts
is there more to life than sayin i figured it out
is there more yeah

sweeter the berry the blacker the juice
the boy is back in the booth ready to tap into truth
too many lyrics bout houses and loot
too many walt disney characters mouses and goofs
i mean you know i love a challenge but challenged by who
ill let you bring a thousand recruits
my peers are a talented group
but even if you take all their statistics and carry the two
even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops
theres still nothin they could really do
its too bad reality checks dont cover the balances due
whenever its time to recoup
yeah soon as this album drop im out of the deal
in the house playin dangelo how does it feel
i got a fear of havin things on my mind when i die
what you got time on your hands or time on your side
is there any sense in doin these songs when im high
is there more to life than goin on trips to dubai
yachts on the fourth of july gfive soarin the skies
is there more to life than all of these corporate ties
and all of these fortunate times
and all of these asses that never come in proportionate size
am i missin somethin thats more important to find
like healin my soul like family time
is there more to life than just when im feelin alive
is there more

passion instant
sweat beads feel me feel me
cupids shot me
my heartbeats racing my heartbeats racing
tempt me drive me tempt me
it feels so exciting
thought of highly highly
its yours entirely

california girls sweeter than pieces of candy

type of hood where bandanas make niggas a family
head on a swivel i could shoot but i could never dribble
life too short i gotta get it fore they blow the whistle
my uncle tryna change my energy with stones and crystals
but its gon take more than that for me to control my issues

im standin at the top of where you niggas are climbin to reach
i even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets
subtle reminders are key jeez
spoiler alert the second act is tragic
and everyone that wants the worst for mes askin what happened
backstabbed so many times i started walkin backwards
like charlamagne i see the light and see the darkest patches
bury me and ill be born again
i walk in godly form amongst the mortal men
i got some real demons across the border fence
and made a note of the mistakes we cant afford again
like i said can of worms and im the early bird
niggas want to hang but im too busy doin dirty work
hit em back and say well link up on the thirtythreerd
when i say that they cursin me it aint dirty words
church of pentecost holy spirit synagogue

youve got me feeling emotions
ayy higher
ahhhhhhh
youve got me fe
you ohhhh

dont link me
dont hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
dont tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
i know the truth is you wont love me until im gone
and even then the thing that comes after is movin on
i cant even capture the feeling i had at first
meetin all my heroes like seein how magic works
the people i look up to are goin from bad to worse
their actions out of character even when they rehearse
workin in the land of the free the home of the brave
i gotta bring my brothers or else i feel out of place
breakin speed records on roads that these niggas paved
and they dont like that its written all on they face
i dont know how ima make it out of here clean
cant even keep track of who plays for the other team
iconic duos rip and split at the seams
goodhearted people are takin it to extremes
leavin me in limbo to question what i believe
leavin me to ask whats their motive in makin peace
leavin me to not trust anybody i meet
leavin me to ask is there anybody like me

youve got me fe
you ohhhh
youve got me fe
you ohhhh ayy

missin out on my years
theres times when i wish i was where i was
back when i used to wish i was here
missin out on my days
scrollin through life and fishin for praise
opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
im tryna see whos there on the other end of the shade
most times its just somebody thats underaged
thats probably just alone and afraid
and lashin out so that someone else can feel they pain
i always hear people complain about the place that they live
that all the people here are fake and they got nothin to give
cause they been starin at somebody elses version of shit
that makes another city seem more excitin than it is
i know a girl whose one goal was to visit rome
then she finally got to rome
and all she did was post pictures for people at home
cause all that mattered was impressin everybody shes known
i know another girl thats cryin out for help
but her latest caption is leave me alone
i know a girl happily married til she puts down her phone
i know a girl that saves pictures from places shes flown
to post later and make it look like she still on the go
look at the way we live
i wasnt hidin my kid from the world
i was hidin the world from my kid
from empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
until you starin at your seed you can never relate
breakin news in my life i dont run to the blogs
the only ones i wanna tell are the ones i can call
they always ask why let the story run if its false
you know a wise man once said nothin at all
im exhausted and drained i cant even pretend
all these people takin miles when you give em an inch
all these followers but who gon follow me to the end
i guess ill make it to the end and ima find out then

youve got me fe
you ohhhh ayy
higher higher
youve got me fe
you ohhhh ayy
higher higher
