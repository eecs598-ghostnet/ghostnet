She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasnt you you would be dissin you dawg
Damn okay from that perspective
I see what youre talkin bout no way to soften that
Cause me I was tryna find out where I lost em at
But maybe I aint lose em at all
Maybe I keep movin forward and theyre just stagnant
They aint movin at all
But when they need a favor who do they call
Maybe Im searchin for the problems
Askin what was said and who was involved
Too focused on peoples feedback and provin em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit no matter whose foot its on
These days feel like Im squeezin in em
Whoever wore em before just wasnt thinkin big enough
Im bout to leave em with em
Cause if I run in the game in these man the seams are splittin
No pun intended but theyre smellin defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it who meetin me there
They tell him that hes talkin crazy but he doesnt care
Bein humble dont work as well as bein aware
Listen up boy youre better off eavesdroppin
We already got spring two thousand and fifteen poppin
PND droppin Repsup P droppin
Majid Jordan droppin OB droppin not to mention me droppin
Feel like we paid the refs off man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah been on the move like the lease is up
And I cant even name one person thats keepin up
Damn fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself how do we match up now
Cause Im only twenty-seven and Im only gettin better
If I havent passed you yet watch me catch up now for real

You see that Ive been goin through it
Hopin everythings okay

Im runnin but cant run away
You say you changed
But you never change up

You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call twenty-two
But youre just the same as I ever knew
forty-four twenty-two
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call twenty-two
But youre just the same as I ever knew
forty-four twenty-two
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call twenty-two
But youre just the same as I ever knew
forty-four twenty-two
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call twenty-two
But youre just the same as I ever knew
forty-four twenty-two
You build it up to break it halfway through
Just make the call twenty-two
But youre just the same as I ever knew

I know I fear trust
I know I fear fear too much
On my plate lookin up
Outer space Pearly Gates

Im runnin but cant run away
You say you changed
But you never change up


Tryna stay light on my toes
Just ran a light in a Rolls
Told me Im lookin exhausted
You hit it right on the nose
Im tired of all of these niggas
Im tired of all of these hoes
Worried bout takin my lane
They aint even got on the road
They turn they back and they leave you
They gon be back when they need you
I practice good over evil
Flippin the script like a readthrough
Yeah all of my brothers we equal
I play my part too like a sequel
You tell your niggas you got em on anything
Question is do they believe you
Specially when you never come through
So much hate inside your heart
We dont even know what we done to you
We just know shit gettin run through
Never chase it let it come to you
You out here tellin everybody everything
You niggas move like the onetwo yeah

And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name you know


Murda on the beat so its not nice
Yeah
Its a Habibis ting ya

Yeah my side girl got a fiveS with the screen cracked
Still hit me back right away better not never hesitate
Dont come around thinkin you gettin saved
Tryna show the dogs brighter days
Got a torch tryna light the way
Bitin everybody which is ironic
Cause your next album probably wont ever see the light of day
Had fans but you let em down
But I guess thats how you niggas gettin down
Im so high up Im like How is niggas really gettin down
I could never have a kid then be out here still kiddin round
Boys playin around where you really wanna take it now
I got a one hundred and fifty thousand dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up I never take us down
But if you bring me up then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then
But its gettin hard for you to fake it now
Fuck bein rich when Im forty man Im tryna make it now


Watch out for me Im about to glow

Watch out for me Im about to glow

Watch out Watch out
Why nigga The cops out Cops out
Its all love when I ride top down Top down
I started out way down low
Started from the bottom now we here now

Watch out for me Im about to glow

Watch out for me Im about to glow

I just take the dreams Ive been sold
And sell em for more you already know

Watch out for me Im about to glow

Watch out for me Im about to glow

I still have my guard up
Blame this thing Im part of
Tryin to avoid more confrontation
I just gotta try harder
Takin the time to clear my mind
Cause soon as Im able to let that go


Yeah stylin though
Dissin but got pictures with me smilin though
All the things you need you still want problems though
All the things I know I still been silent though
Yeah used to be at SilverCity Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom playin dominoes
I dont want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin at the studio
I dont have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old
Maybe it never gets old and thats just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone callin plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the Dome
I need forty thousand people to see what Im on
Yeah ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yout when I was writin Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
Ill probably selfdestruct if I ever lose but I never do
Steady doin double shifts
oneda doin the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because Im generous
Thirtyseater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin up we just laugh about it
Cant describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep til mornin on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assure that my mind is right
Get no sick days I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil updates texts in my inboxes have been poppin
Seasons go by like Im bingewatchin
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin up at a club less we doin bis
I cant even party while a nigga pursuin this
Distractions will do you in in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me whatever splits it up
So theres more for them and theres less for me
They dont know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No ones done it successfully
sevenAM in Germany cant believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin to let go of anything thatll burden me
Thats the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart its always executed perfectly
If we do a song its like takin my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity you one day star
Swear I Told You that Im in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors a lot of six God worshipping
Done talk now cause theres other shit thats concernin me
Theres real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog but his grandmothers his surety
He cant even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered round competition and currency
Takin summer off cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin back to my regular life will humble me
Ill be back in two thousand and eighteen to give you the summary
More Life


Ive been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin fake love to me
Straight up to my face straight up to my face
Ive been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me

Straight up to my face straight up to my face

Somethin aint right when we talkin
Somethin aint right when we talkin

Since things never been the same

Ive been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin fake love to me
Straight up to my face straight up to my face
Ive been down so long it look like up to me
They look up to me
I got fake people showin fake love to me
Straight up to my face straight up to my face

Skrrt
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name you know


Big cup of Ac Im drowsy
Im still posted up where you first found me
Did I just read that you just got engaged on me
I heard from your friend you couldnt even tell me
Or better yet wait on me

Nah shanahnahnahnahnah
Shanahnahnahnahnah
Cant just leave it off that way
Shanahnahnahnahnah
Shanahnahnah
Cant just leave it off that way nah

Least do I get an invitation or something
A statement or something
Ask about that you would say it was nothing
But heres another nothing that you made into something
Cant just leave it off that way


I dont care what society thinks Theyre nothing anyway Theyre no better than me Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that somebodys already laid out for you Life we live you have to set your own patterns your own ideals You have to handle the whole job yourself Yeah

No snow tires the Range slipslide like Trick Daddy and Trina
Oli North pull in like ten million a season
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in
If we not on the charts my XO niggas eatin
Fiftytwo consecutive weekends shout out to Weeknd
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin
Not when everybody out here beefin
We got it now we just gotta keep it
Americas most wanted man Im still on the run
All these number ones and we still not the ones
No hard feelings but Ill still get you spun
Went and got diplomas and we still goin dumb
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin
My competition its beyond offensive
Im in it for the glory not the honor mention
Not tryna be fourth and inches Im tryna go the distance
Yeah distance Im on a different mission
This the remix to Ignition hot and fresh out the kitchen
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches
Too overly ambitious too late to fix it
Too late for condolences when its over with
I need to start sayin shit when I notice it
Be open with people I need some closure with
Be honest with myself and take ownership
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first
Excitin times revitalized
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively
Im just takin what God will give me
Grateful like Jerry Bob and Mickey
Better attitude well see where it gets me
I know catchin flies with honey is still sticky
I wrote the book on worldclass finesses
And tasteful gestures and makin efforts
And never placin second
And even better knowin youre first but then takin second
Inspirin and never takin credit
I know I deserve more I just never said it
Two middle fingers as I make a exit yeah

Did I lose you
Did I Did I
Did I lose you
Did I Did I
Did I lose you

Winnin is problematic
People like you more when you workin towards somethin
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin times but fuck it I manage
Why is my struggle different than others
Only child thats takin care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
Thats not respectable all of a sudden
I dont get a pat on the back for the come up
What do you see when you see me
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write and not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look now I mean its hard to believe it even for me
But youre mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin me at all
To wantin to see me lose it all
Things get dark but my aura just starts glowin
Im overcome with emotions
Ones I cant access when Im stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man we wrote the book on calculated thinkin
And icy Heineken drinkin and rival neighborhoods linkin
And puttin your trust in someone with the risk of financially sinkin
All you did was write the book on garbageass Rollies
Ego strokin picture postin
Claimin that youd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See I know cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin
I notice people standin for nothin and gettin tired
I know what were both thinkin even when youre quiet
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didnt lose you

Did I Did I
Did I lose you
Did I Did I
Did I lose you


I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows Im trying
God knows Im trying for you
God knows Im trying

God knows it
Pure mind and pure soul I possess he knows it
Anointed and protected I was chosen
My heart is way too frozen to get broken

I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows Im trying
God knows Im trying for you
God knows Im trying

People change Im not surprised
Devils working overtime
Voodoo spells put on my life
It wont work they all have tried

I cannot tell who is my friend
I need distance between me and them
Gonna have to teach me how to love you again
God knows Im trying
God knows Im trying for you
God knows Im trying

You put food on the table for me aye
Alright fam soft I see you aye
You pay my bills right
Its light
Youre a wasteman

If you were worried about where
Ive been or who I saw or
What club I went to with the homies
Baby dont worry you know that you got me
Im never worried about where
Im at or who I saw or
What club I go to with the homies
Baby dont worry I know that they got me


Yeah yeah oh you gotta love it
Oh you gotoh you gotta love it
I heard what circulated lets get to the bottom of it
I told oneda send me something and I got it covered
Somehow I always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds
On my last album cover
The game is all mine and Im mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see them take at me they all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep wanting more
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit just to feel a couple things twice
twenty-eight at midnight wonder whats next for me
Longevity wonder how long theyll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation but cant change it alone
I heard a little little homie talking reckless in Vibe
Thats quite a platform you chose
You shouldve kept it insideoh you tried
Its so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girls age
It gets worse by the annual my careers like a HowTo manual
So I guess its understandable man
Oh you gotta love it you gotta love it yeah
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get em
To show they outfits off guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed man who are we kiddin
Im managed by my friends that I grew up with
Id rather give that fifteen to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadnt made it with this rappin
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are yeah
Lately I feel the haters eatin away at my confidence
They scream out my failures
And whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we had words
And stories bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women Im overtextin are PMSing
Crazy this yearfuckin with my image
Ive been tryna reach the youth so I can save em this year
Fuck it I guess I gotta wait til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
Bout how we need protection from those protectin the block
Nobody lookin out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein somebody that makes the news
So everybody can tweet about it
And then they start to RIP about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn I just had to say my piece about it
Oh you gotta love itbut they scared of the truth
So back to me showin out in public thats a hotter subject
Ive been whippin Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley Tasha Bianca
Julia Ericka Southern America
Part of my heritage pardon my arrogance
Part in my hair again thats that comeback flow
Comeback flow once I start its apparent
Im with girl whose ass is so big thats partly embarrassin
But fuck all the blushin and fuck your discussions
And fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately whats irkin you
Shit is gettin so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that Im number one over all these niggas
Bein number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music nobody seein us
Winter here already but somehow Im heatin up
Been observin the game and felt like Ive seen enough
Lets drop a tape on these niggas then well see whats up
Yeah boy you rappin like you seen it all
You rappin like the throne should be the three of yall
Best I Ever Had seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please take it ease wheres the love and the peace
Why you rappin like you come from the streets
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And Im never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody thats comin for me
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin like its just forty Oli and me
Cuttin all loose ends I be the barber for free
Im almost at four minutes going off on the beat
Feel like Im in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man oh you gotta love it
And on top of that its getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me
And now its everybody else thats getting hard to believe
But man oh you gotta love it
And head to toe Im Prada covered
I know your girl well just not in public
Blame the city Im a product of it
Young nigga from the cityyou gotta love it


I got some shit for you to come and get

She worry bout me from home you know she raised me alone
She said I heard you back with you know who
I told her girl Im always back with you know who yeah
And she like Who are we kidding Youre twenty-seven youre just being you
Youre your fathers child man thank God you got some me in you
At least I always at least I always see it through
At least Im always being true to what you taught me
Retired teacher but your words still got me evolvin
Never get sloppy drunk but alcohol is problem solvin
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends
And assistants always convinced that theres someone better
Like that girl from your gym who trains you
I know you wanna arrange it you told me shes free Thursday
And Im sure that shes an angel but she dont want this life
The timing aint right
Maybe one day but even one day with us is the time of her life
We do things that people pay to document
You got the sweetest heart
But Im not here to give out compliments
Or boost nobodys confidence momma
I got no friends in this momma
I dont pretend with this momma
Ion joke with this momma
I pull the knife out my back and I cut they throat with it momma

I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two momma
Its just they cloning me momma

But you and the six raised me right
Dont ever take advice that was great advice

You and the six raised me right that shit saved my life

Yeah
Having conversations with momma we start talkin bout dad
You know he dropping a single he saying this is his window
That nigga still wearing linen that nigga still in the club
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love
That nigga Memphis for real girl he love you to death
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesnt accept
But he just want our forgiveness and fuck it look how were living
Im content with this story who are we not to forgive him
At least I been to a prison at least I know what its like

Yeah you feel the pressure man I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like Im David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin out of my section
OVO on me while yall niggas was playin dressup
And I know who gon take the fall with me
They right here on call with me they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
Theyve been sayin its love but it isnt love is it
Toast to the days when they wasnt out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesays I was buyin fitteds everyday
Kiddies Caribana tryin not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left my mama had her saddest day
Its only up from here I promise you just gotta wait
And she took my word for it thats all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
Im gettin straight to the point with it
Need yall to know that I never needed none of yall niggas
Fuck bein all buddy buddy with the opposition
Its like the front of the plane nigga its all business
But I havent flown with yall boys in a minute

Look theyd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when its twenty below
Who you think runnin this show
You saw it in me at twenty years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin in code
I got a pure soul I dont do the hate
You dont worry bout fittin in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin shots the night before the game
Still drop forty with liquor in my system
Numbers goin unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but Ill never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin like Im Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin scales bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in Id rather get you myself
Runnin through the six thumbin through the contracts
Im possessed you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but theyll get it soon
I still got somethin left to prove since you left me room
Paint a plan for the family debt we in the minus
And like its goin in a trunk I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go I got it Ill take us wherever
Im a staple in the game all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements gotta start to make em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karmas such a thing of beauty
Id share more of my story but you wouldnt believe it
Its farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it a hundred like Im running a fever
I might take a breather but I wont ever leave you
If I was you I wouldnt like me either

Cant get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know forty wants peace but Im down to cut ties for it
And I cant sleep these days unless I take one
If they dont have a story these days theyll make one
Life is always on man I never get a break from it
Doesnt matter where I go I can never get away from it

Damn
Im not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they aint with it then lets just forget it
Relationships slowin me down they slow down the vision
Guess Im not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me theyre proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin closure it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it couldve been different
Wonder what theyd do put in my position
I wonder when my shit drop do they listen
Wonder if theyre second guessin their decisions
I hate the number two that shit is unforgiven
Tryna satisfy everybody
Its like they cant get enough
Until enough is enough
And then its too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you you know you poppin
Ill kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedrooms where we get it poppin
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
Im a walkin comeup Im a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin
Whos gonna save me when I need savin
Since Take Care Ive been caretakin
But second chances that aint how you livin
Redemption on your mind Ill never be forgiven

Yeah

Jheeze yeah

That cant sit well
Oh well ship sailed

Cosign cosign

Hype Williams Big Pimpin yeah

Doing plat plat only
Boys better back off me
Hall of fame hall of fame

Whole city goin crazy

Top five no debatin
Top five top five top five
And the whole city rate me
And Im back inside The Matrix
And I said that we would make it
Aim squad with some traitors
Knew my niggas from the basement
This aint no metalongtheway shit
We done really put some days in


One of dem onesright

Weston Road Flows I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldnt buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother man we had to respect it
He was wavy doin mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably wouldve got in less trouble just goin with him
Feel like I never say much but man theres a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin to show
Im lookin at they first week numbers like What are those
I mean you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and Im Eddie Murphy we tradin places
Look in the mirror Im closer than I really appear
Creepin like Chilli without the tender love and care
No tender love and care no love and affection
I got a price on my head but theres a risk to collect it
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldnt pull it together
Yeah but here we are and its a new semester
forty the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin
A lot of problems that cant be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like Im born yesterday you forgot my birthday
You dont be scorin perfect
You dont be workin like how we be workin
You platinum like wrappers
On Hersheys boy that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you aint heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays they just shakin my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD we relate we get the same attention
Its rainin money Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper thirty-five and under
Im assumin everybodys thirty-five and under
Thats when I plan to retire man its already funded
Yeah I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun when I got signed they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat just have some patience with me
You wouldnt tell me you loved me started seein Monique
Last time I heard from Monique TMinus was makin beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk of the corner store is Im TBE
The best ever dont ever question you know better
But shit aint how it always seems when its so together
Yeah I let that last line breathe it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows my confidence level gettin settled
Dont get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Dont let your newfound fame fool you
Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely I really do this
Been flowin stupid since Vince Carter
Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis I been through it
Yall was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin on waste movements
You was ridin TTC metro I had the place boomin
First take Drake you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin in that bitch like we already knew it
But money cant buy happiness Jellee talkin truthful
But Im happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want

Yeah thats right yeah


Yeah I pull up in Lexus like its seven
I just hit a lick I got to hit a next one
Last year I know you learned your lesson
I could GPS you if you need addressin
Boss up Im the bigger homie
But Im one year older than my lil homie
nine they was biddin on me
But Im Young Money got it written on me
Okay now we got some action
Everything I said it happened
That boy light as Michael Jackson
But on verses he been blackin
Chasin women a distraction
They wan be on TV right next to me
You cannot be here right next to me
Dont you see Riri right next to me
I hate a rapper especially
They feel the same but they hide it
They just discuss it in private
Dont get along man we tried it
Whats the point in even tryin
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin to mention me
They gotta die out eventually
I cannot give you the recipe
You know the game is sold separately
Swear I just had an epiphany
It cost me fifty at Tiffanys
Shout out to Tiffany Stephanie
They used to always come check for me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I dont let it get to me

Done
Look what Ive done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me Im just dunning the hype
Me Im just dunning the hype
Me Im just done done done done done

I dont take this shit for granted
I do my own propaganda
I feel like Juelz Santana
Leg hangin out the Phantom
six cold like Alaska
Views already a classic
Roy outta here like NASA
Bustin ones out the plastic
Her gram too poppin to fuck her
The chain too heavy to tuck it Im serious
I feed my family with this
So dont play with my money this summer Im serious
I dont run out of material
You shouldnt speak on me period
You try to give em your side of the story
They heard it but they wasnt hearin it
They feeling a way and wont hide it
Niggas done being silent
Dont get along man we tried it
Whats the point of even tryin
I hate a goofy especially
They always dyin to mention me
They gotta go they gotta go
They gonna die out eventually
I cannot give em no empathy
Ima have Bs when Im seventy
They cannot fuck with the legacy
I dont know what else is left for me
After this no one a threat to me
My enemies wanna be friends with my other enemies
I dont let it get to me

Done
Look what Ive done in my life
I had to count it and count it again
To make sure the money was right
They love to talk
Me Im just done in the hype
Me Im just done in the hype
Me Im just done done done done done


Grips on your waist front way back way
You know that I dont play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when Im away
Oti oti
Theres never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray I pray

Thats why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

Strength and guidance
All that Im wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text reply me
I dont wanna spend time fighting
Weve got no time

And thats why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me

I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time fore I go
Higher powers taking a hold on me


Its a little chilly out there
How you can stand there is beyond me

All of my lets just be friends are friends I dont have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I shouldve tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my lets just be friends are friends I dont have anymore
Guess thats what they say you need family for
Cause I cant depend on you anymore

Always saw you for what you couldve been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car that looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you couldve been
And even when its business with you its personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet and now were meeting our end

And its all because you chose a side
Youre supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasnt time yeah
And of course you went and chose a side that wasnt mine

Youre so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what Im going through
You cant even figure out whats going on with you
You judge me fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the players anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in LA I dont know whats going on
I dont know whats going on

And its all because you chose a side
Youre supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasnt time yeah
And of course you went and chose a side that wasnt mine

You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause Im living right
When I needed you you couldnt give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
Im fooding and serving them all like Im working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya Ill always love ya thats how I was raised
Same way Im right here still feeling the way
Same way Im realizing on a day to day that

All of my lets just be friends are friends I dont have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I shouldve tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my lets just be friends are friends I dont have anymore
Guess thats what they say you need your family for
Cause I cant depend on you anymore
Much closer

Anytime people want to start problems
Its like for real are you dumb
You know who mans are
Im not afraid no gyal heart man
And Im not afraid of no cyattie
And Im not afraid of no waste yute neither
So anybody who want it can get it
Seh feh


I should be downtown whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it thats got you all gassed up
Changin your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you dont have the time to wait on me

I tried with you
Theres more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didnt sit right with you
And now youre tryna make me feel a way on purpose
Now youre throwing it back in my face on purpose
Now youre talking down on my name on purpose yeah
And you dont feel no way you think I deserve it
Worlds worlds worlds famous

But she dont have my heart beating double time
You just shut it down girl

I know its getting late but girl I dont want you to leave
You tell me youre just not the type you wanna do this right
And Im not trying to say I dont believe you
But I refuse to feel ashamed and if you feel the same
Does waiting really make us better people

Nothing is what I can picture you in
So take that fucking dress off I swear you wont forget me
Youll be happy that you let me

Young Money

Weve been everywhere and back
But I just cant remember it all
What am I doing What am I doing
Oh yeah thats rightIm doing me Im doing me
Im living life right now man
And this what Ima do til its over til its over
But its far from over

Alright bottles on me long as someone drink it
Never drop the ball fuck are yall thinking
Making sure the Young Money ship is never sinking
About to set it off in this bitch Jada Pinkett
I shouldnt have drove tell me how Im getting home
You too fine to be laying down in bed alone
I could teach you how to speak my language Rosetta Stone
I swear this life is like the sweetest thing Ive ever known
About to go thriller Mike Jackson on these niggas
All I needs a fucking red jacket with some zippers
Super good smidoke a package of the Swishers
I did it overnight it couldnt happen any quicker
Yall know them Well fuck it me neither
But point the biggest skeptic out Ill make him a believer
It wouldnt be the first time I done it throwing hundreds
When I should be throwing ones bitch I run it

I know way too many people here right now
That I didnt know last yearwho the fuck are yall
I swear it feels like the last few nights
Weve been everywhere and back
But I just cant remember it all
What am I doing What am I doing
Oh yeah thats rightIm doing me Im doing me
Im living life right now man
And this what Ima do til its over til its over
But its far from over

One thing bout music when it hits you feel no pain
And I swear I got this shit that make these bitches go insane
So they tell me that they love me
I know better than that its just game
Its just what comes with the fame
And Im ready for that Im just saying
But I really cant complain everything is kosher
Two thumbs up Ebert and Roeper
I really cant see the end getting any closer
But Ill probably still be the man when everything is over
So Im riding through the city with my high beams on
Can you see me Can you see me Get your Visine on
Yall just do not fit the picture turn your widescreen on
If you thinking Ima quit before I die dream on
Man they treat me like a legend am I really this cold
Im really too young to be feeling this old
Its about time you admit it who you kidding
Man nobodys ever done it like I did it uh

I know way too many people here right now
That I didnt know last yearwho the fuck are yall
I swear it feels like the last few nights
Weve been everywhere and back
But I just cant remember it all

You could thank me now go head
Thank me later yeah I know what I said
But later doesnt always come so instead
Its okay you could thank me now

Mahalo from the hardest act to follow
Lately Ive been drinking like theres a message in a bottle
Alohas to women with no ties to men
That I know well that way there are no lies
You can thank me now for all the info I give to you niggas
Im on the brink of influential Im here for you niggas
I guess a hit doesnt add up to a career for you niggas
I must have been hard to watch what a year for you niggas
Its December thirty-onest and we in Miami just meditating
You got your resolutions we just got reservations
Living out a dream it feels like I stayed up
And we just want to party Patron straight up
Fuck that old shit Im on new things
OVO Clique Red Wing Boot Gang
Yeah we want it all half was never the agreement
Who would have thought the route wed chosen
Would ever end up the scenic
I can relate to kids going straight to the league
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed
And thats around the time
That your idols become your rivals
You make friends with Mike
But got to AI him for your survival
Damn I swear sports and music are so synonymous
Cause we want to be them and they want to be us
So on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment
That you take for granted you can thank me now
And oh my goodness youre welcome youre welcome
At this point me is who I am trying to save myself from
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them
Cause they think that I can help them
Get back to where they fell from
But drink up cause everyone here is good tonight
Except the niggas that I came with they good for life
Thats how you know its going down
In case another chance never comes around

You could thank me now go head
Thank me later yeah I know what I said
But later doesnt always come so instead
Its okay you could thank me now

Shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming
I think Im spending all my time with the wrong women
I think Ill have a chance at love and knowing me Ill miss it
Cause me dedicating my time just isnt realistic
Man the good girls went silent on me
They got a boyfriend or left for college on me
And all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me
But do I ever come up in discussion
Over double pump lattes and low fat muffins
Do I Or is missing what we had out of the question
Im probably just the reason that you learned your lesson
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes
Who was there before it all I guess thats how it goes
They hear about your cons but focus on your pros
And love you for who you are from the bottom of their soul
But those same ones from your area will grow into women
That are ready to get married at hello
Because of what they allowed where are they all now
I know theyre somewhere watching
So Im trying to make them proud
Searching for the meaning youll find it next to me
They tell me Im the hottest guess we finally get to see
Im feeling like Nas who am I to disagree
They say the doors will open up
Soon as you find the missing key
Thats probably why Im in this bitch shining
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded
And the bandwagons full
But you can try and run behind it Im sorry
Poolside drinking Margarita rounds
Shout out to my city though I hardly be in town
Im the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown
And I know life is just a game
In which the cards are facing down
Im in a world where things are taken never given
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision
And Im aware that this could be the last time you listen
So while Im still here in this position

You could thank me now go head
Thank me later yeah I know what I said
But later doesnt always come so instead
Its okay you could thank me now


Kush rolled glass full I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isnt everything
Im havin a good time they just trying to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that Im the youngest nigga doing it
Cap on brim bent Denzel every time
She aint tryna pop that shit for pimp okay well nevermind
III tried to told you Drizzy still aint nothin nice
Bracelet saying you should quit cars saying fuck your life
Okay now we outta here toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up I got the voodoo for you bitches
Im busy gettin rich I dont want trouble
I made enough for two niggas boy stunt double
Fame is like a drug that Ive taken too much of
But I never ever trip just peace happiness and love
I got money in these jeans so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket nigga this is what I does

Doing things that I wont regret

People really hate it when a backpack rapper
Get rich and start living that life dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper hip hop hates you
They would do it just like I do it if they could
Its in our natureyoung and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of the killa

So Imma spend another ten thousand for Dilla

Yesterday when we were getting high
You were invited you woulda liked it
I I I know you all too well
I said that we could kiss the past goodbye
But you werent excited
Theres no way to fight it
You can stay but shawty here I go

Should I spend a weekend in Vegas
Im living inside a moment not taking pictures to save it
I mean how could I forget My memorys never faded
I cant relate to these haters my enemies never made it
I am still here with who I started with
The game needed life I put my heart in it
I blew myself up Im on some martyr shit
Carry the weight for my city like a cargo ship
Im twenty-three with a money tree
Growing more too I just planted a hundred seeds
Its ironic cause my mother was a florist
And thats how she met my pops
And now my garden is enormous
Its happening Penny Lane just like you said
I avoided the coke game and went with Sprite instead
Uhhuh thats word to the millions that they putting up
Im trying to do better than good enough

What am I afraid of
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I dont have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say You promised me you would never change
You promised me you would never change

Am I wrong for making light of my situation Clap on
When forty got some shit for me to snap on now that Im on
I dont really want to worry about getting back on
Im just trying to stay on get my fucking buffet on
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursing home
And I be acting like I dont know how to work a phone
But hit redial youll see that I just called
Some chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all and
Plus this woman that I messed with unprotected
Texted saying she wished she would have kept it
The one that Im laying next to just looked over and read it
Man I couldnt tell you where the fuck my head is
Im holding on by a thread
Its like Im high right now the guy right now
And you could tell by looking in my eyes right now
That nothing really comes as a surprise right now
Cause we just having the time of our lives right now

What am I afraid of
This is supposed to be what dreams are made of
But people I dont have the time to hang with
Always look at me and say the same shit
They say You promised me you would never change
You promised me you would never change

I live by some advice this girl Lissa told me
The other day Lissa told me that she missed the old me
Which made me question when I went missing
And when I started treating my friends different
Maybe it was the fast paced switch up
Or the two guns in my face during the stick up
Maybe cause a girl I thought I trusted
Was who set the whole shit up
But in fact I havent seen them since they locked Big Rich up
I know but same time Im quick to forget
Im bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets
Burn it all burn it all Im starting it fresh
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed
Did I just trade free time for camera time
Will I blow all of this money baby hammer time
Yeah I just need some closure
Aint no turning back for me Im in it til its over


Money just changed everything
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow
Looking down from the top and its crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear em talking I just dont know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me Im slowly embracing it
Doesnt come natural bear with me it could take a bit
Yeah and my dreams are who Im racing with
But you can see Im pacing it so that Im always chasing it
Wayne put me right here thats who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah this life is something I would die for
Octobers Own but its looking like July four
I just wish theyd let you try it first
This time Im really going off fireworks

Oh today it begins
Ive missed them before
But wont miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means

Im just such a gentleman you should give it up for me
Look at how Im placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasnt love I just thought youd fuck with me
Who could of predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me
Damn I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night It always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden these gossip blogs want to cover me
And you making it seem that it happened that way because of me
But I was curious
And Ill never forget it baby what an experience
You couldve been the one but it wasnt that serious
There was smoke in the air before that was me clearing it
That felt good all in all I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming you just get to see it go
Yeah I shouldve looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes fireworks

Oh today it begins
Ive missed them before
But wont miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means

Everythings the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowing that I still listen
And hes still got his foot out guilt tripping
Its been years though I just learn to deal with it
For real me and my realtor we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city I let her explore
And now shes saying shes more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents marriages lasted
I was only five I bet I barely reacted
Im flying back home for the Heritage Classic
Searching for that feeling tell me where is the magic
Lets stay together til were ghosts
I want to witness love I never seen it close
Yeah but I guess I gotta find it first
Thats why Im really going off fireworks

Oh today it begins
Ive missed them before
But wont miss them again
I keep having the same dream
And I think that I just realized what it means


Let me know let me know
Ahhh let me know
Let me know let me know

Uhh yeah
This is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I havent slept in days and me and my latest girl agreed
To go our separate ways so Im single
Thinkin bout what we had and missin you
But I aint Santa I got somethin for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me tryin not to get caught out
They always seem to catch me with the woman that I brought out
Baby dont hold on too long cause thats how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me eat your muthafuckin heart out
Its Drizzy always gone but never hard to find
And since you cant escape me do I ever cross your mind
Because all this shit is new to me Im learnin to behave
And still spendin every dollar they encourage me to save
But Im good I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle
Im lookin forward to the memories of right now
Never forgettin from where I came
And no matter where Im headed I promise to stay the same
Im just

Im just ridin round the city
With my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl Im the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talkin bout the greatest
I just really hope that I just really hope that youll think of me
I just really hope that Youll think of me
I just really hope that Youll think of me
Im doing my thing Im doing my thing Im doing my thing
Cause Im tryna be unforgettable

Im just ridin round the city
With my hood on and my windows down
Ask your girl Im the realest nigga she been around
When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters
And when you get to talkin bout the greatest
I just really hope that I just really hope that youll think of me
I just really hope that Youll think of me
I just really hope that Youll think of me
Im doing my thing Im doing my thing Im doing my thing
Cause Im tryna be unforgettable


Uh you getting ready so I know we gon be here awhile
In the bathroom flat irons and nail files
Spending hours in salons on your hairstyles
In the mall steady racking up the air miles
Hit the gym step on the scales stare at the number
You say you droppin ten pounds preparin for summer
And you dont do it for the man men never notice
You just do it for yourself youre the fucking coldest
Intelligent too ooh youre my sweetheart
Ive always liked my women book and street smart
Long as they got a little class like half days
And the confidence to overlook my past ways
Time heals all and heels hurt to walk in
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in
And look I really think nobody does it better
I love the way that you put it together uh

Atlanta girls let me see your hands Yeah
Wave em at them bitches hating on you with their friends Come on
Girl you got it let em know that everything big
Nails done hair done everything big
And my NY girls let me see your hands
Wave em at them bitches hating on you with their friends Come on
Girl you got it let em know that everything big
Nails done hair done everything big
And my LA girls let me see your hands
Wave em at them bitches hating on you with their friends Come on
Girl you got it let em know everything big
Nails done hair done everything big
And my TO girls let me see your hands
Wave em at them bitches hating on you with their friends Yeah
Girl you got it let em know everything big
Nails done hair donenails done hair done
Say go Cinderella go Cinderella
Orgasm blush lipstick and concealer
Devil in a tight dress girl you a killer
And aint nobody realer and aint nobody realer go
Go go go go go go go Showtime
Go go go go go As we proceed

Uh five and a half in boys ass is off the hook
Cinderella bout to lose the glass off her foot
And when I find it is when I find you
And we can do the things we never got the time to
Better late than never but never late is better
They tell me time is money well well spend it together
Im down for whatever you just lead the way
We go to dinner you dont even look at me to pay
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley
How she got it I aint never get to ask
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash
Yeah but shout out to the homeowners
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us
A little something extra should we ever need it
If it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it


Things have been so crazy and hectic
I shoulda gotten back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
Its probably better anyhow
So if you gotta go
If theres anything I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If youre looking for a purpose

You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now Im off singing karaoke
Further than Ive ever been
So if you gotta go
If theres any way I can help

Isnt it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner
That tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta
Damn of all the places you could go
I just thought youd choose somewhere
That had somebody that you know
Im always up too late I worry bout you there alone
In that place you call your home warm nights and cold Patron
I hope that you dont get known for nothing crazy
Cause no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest
But that first cut is the deepest
I tried to keep us together you were busy keeping secrets
Secrets you were telling everybody but me
Dont be fooled by the money Im still just young and unlucky
Im surprised you couldnt tell

I was only trying to get ahead
I was only trying to get ahead
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And youre looking for a purpose


Yeah I know we just signed a deal but
I need my advance on the next one too
They know Ima be around
Yeah I need it

Cause I got a really big team
And they need some really big rings
They need some really nice things
Better be comin with no strings

We need some really nice things
We need some really big rings

Look at the smile on me look at the owl on me
I do not chase girls but they run a mile for me
Say she gon ride for me Ill buy the tires for you
This game is different
You only get one shot when niggas gon foul on you
Man fuck em all man we want it all
Dont get too involved we gon knock ya off
And to top it off Im with all the dogs
Its a new season and we still breathin

And I got a really big team
And they need some really big rings
They need some really nice things

Never thought Id be talkin from this perspective
But Im not really sure what else you expected
When the higherups have all come together as a collective
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message
forty did you get the message
Cause I just checked my phone and I didnt get it
I mean I say hats off for a solid effort
But we didnt flinch for a second we got our shit together
Yeah not here to fight wars
But niggas wanna talk high scores
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche
And I just came from dinner where I ate some welldone seared scallops that were to die for
But I got bigger fish to fry
Im talkin bigger shit than you and I
Kids are losin lives got me scared of losin mine
And if I hold my tongue about it I get crucified
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night
Flyin over Chattanooga
Out here tryna spread the movement
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman
You niggas never heard of it you gotta hit up Google
Back in the city shit is gettin brutal
These kidsll hit your noodle then take a girl to the movies
Theyve been droppin out on both sides
We aint in it we just ghost ride
The pen is workin if you niggas need some ghost lines
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine
I guess you just makin moves on your own time
But just know itll be January in no time
And your absence is very concernin
Its like you went on vacation with no plan of returnin
Shit is purely for sport I need a thirty for thirty
Banners are ready in case we need to retire your jersey
I got a club in the Raptors arena
Championships celebrations durin regular seasons
Paternity testin for women that I never slept with
Im legally obligated if they request it
So much legal action like Im Michael Jackson
Luckily Im great at avoidin distraction
Used to give no reaction now Im overreacting
Ahh nigga that shit gotta go platinum
I just listened to Closer to My Dreams
Wide eyed and uneducated at nineteen
I cant rap like that all young and naive
Not after all of the shit Ive seen and the things I believe
Drastically changin thank you for all your patience
Im just in a different space and I choose to embrace it
four thousand square feet just isnt as spacious
You loved me back in the basement
Guess it is what we make it
Im tired of awkward exchanges and niggas crooked ways
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother
The season start and I dont wanna
See you end up with nothin
Yall throw the word family around too much in discussion
Rookie season I wouldve never thought this was comin
They knees give out and they passing to you all of a sudden
Now you the one gettin buckets
They put their arm around you
Now you becomin the crutches
Kids got on your number cause you the one they look up to
And women that you seen on TV look better in person
And either they wanna fuck you or convince you
That they care to see where it goes from there
But these aint the girls from Brampton
This aint that local action
The haters just bringin me and my people closer actually
What happened to the things
You niggas said was supposed to happen
Are we just supposed to
Ignore the fact that it never happened
We just supposed to get the pie and then split it in two
Supposed to forget your mistakes but not forget about you
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf
And treat the money like secrets keep that shit to ourselves
Papi champú young pablito de seis dios
six GOD I think I was destined for this shit
When I was round Keyshia Cole and TI
And Young Dro was poppin off with Aint I
Way before niggas had they hands out
Like they doin macarena
But who am I to complain now Im still around they know


I wake up on a daily basis
I count the money man Im already rich

Wake up and pray every morning

And my stomach was soakin wet she only fifty-two
And forty that was all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poured up

This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan
And my delivery just got me buzzin like the pizza man

But inside Im treadin water steady tryna swim to shore

Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to
My girlfriend my girlfriend call herself my girlfriend
Tell me that we posed to be together til the world end
But I dont really feel that

I forgot to call you on your birthday
You swear youre the last thing on my mind yeah
There is nothing I can do to fix it
All you ever asked me for was time whoa

So can you do me a favor
If I pull it together make it sooner than later
We wont be here forever and I realize I waited too long
But please dont move on

You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
Every chance I get to make it better
I just find a way to let it go whoa

So can you do me a favor
If I pull it together make it sooner than later
We wont be here forever and I realize I waited too long
But please dont move on

The girl or the world You see someone gotta lose
I thought that I could have it all do I really gotta choose
What good is all the cash if it doesnt buy time
And what good is being famous if Im never on your mind
Nights fallin lights glowing
And Im just trying to pay the price owing
And I dont want to feel the comfort from my ice showing
And I aint tryna be without you at the right moments
Nigga nice going is it worth it That decision
Cause hearts break and I aint tryna be in that collision
So Ima dust my shirt and fix my pants
Cause I better look good girl if this my chance I swear

So can you do me a favor
If I pull it together make it sooner than later
We wont be here forever and I realize I waited too long
But please dont move on


Hands down Im too proud for love
But with eyes shut its you Im thinkin of
But how we move from A to B it cant be up to me
Cause you dont know who I was before you
And basically to see a change in me
Id be losing so I just ignore you yeah
Oh but youre on my mind my mind my mind my mind my mind
Oh but maybe in time in time in time Ill tell you Im

A little bit a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that Im a little bit a little bit
A little bit in love with you

I know you told me break their hearts
But its you I wanna take apart
And I will never ever be the first to say it
But still I they know I
I would do it push a button
Pull a trigger climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff cause youre my baby
I love you love you a little bit
I would do it you would say it
You would mean it we could do it
It was you and I and only I mmm

I hope they never find out
What they already know know know
As soon as its official
Well have to let it go go go
So we dont confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You could teach me many things
Im just scared to learn a lesson
The pressures on both hearts beat like a metronome
Both in sync like a Justin song
Feels so right but its just so wrong
I wonder where my world bout
When niggas that I know tryna take my girl out
And her friends say I aint the one to go for
She just jealous cause you always get approached more
Oh well tell her fall back
Caught up in some more shit tell her call back
Tell her get a man that aint cheatin on her ass
Wit a girl that I know yeah tell her all that that
And as for you I think I know youre the one
The closest Ive come Im probably a

A little bit a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that Im a little bit a little bit
A little bit in love with you oh
Oh oh

I hope they document what Im becomin
Congratulations

Im at the private airport boardin somethin
I see nothing from afar but Im far from nothing
Put on your poker face Ill pull ya card if youre bluffin
But I aint with the hard talk
I got a monopoly catch me on my boardwalk
Like I said we pull your card and find out youre a Hallmark
Just know Im breakin world records no false start
I dont see your point unless its gunpoint or somethin
My deal like Weezy first week one point somethin
And my verses gettin stupider
Wayne if youre on Mars can you pick me up from Jupiter
Phone blowin up so Im cuttin off my cellular
Im a superstar noted on to my nebula
I will break a leg break an arm and a fibula
When I break it down when I when I break it down
I hug and kiss the drum kick
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit
But you could never beat my ass pause
Again dammit yall again
Yall pretend that we are some men that get it on and in
Ill die before I lose cause I was born to win
If he dont fuck with yall then dont bother him
And yes I fuck this game but I wont father them
Right uh

Its like these days man Im booked and Im busy
Dad named me Drake Footz named me Drizzy
They tried to tell me Id never be nothin but a protege
But if you watched the VMAs theres nothing more to say
I got the key to happiness and all the copies
Remember this day like you bought a poppy
And damn how I get so nice
I just spent it all once bout to get rich twice
Surprise party bitch now its on and poppin
I always choose dough like its my only option
Cause money always knows best
Chain snatch flow they say Get it off your chest
And Im what all the fuss about
And if they talkin I bet Im what they discussion bout
Hit me at the office same extension
Consider me the reason yall should pay attention


Dont go missing fly with me
Dont go missing fly with me fly with me
Dont go missing fly with me
Check it out check it out
Dont go missing fly with me fly with me

Im aware that we just met
I dont wanna leave you yet
Promise that I wont forget
Im coming back Im coming back
Yes Ill be there oh yes Ill be there oh
About to board a flight sitting at my gate
I just wanna touch you but Im so far away Im so
All I wanna do is give you all of me now
Are you ready Are you ready Oh

Dont go missing fly with me
Dont go missing fly with me fly with me
Dont go missing fly with me
Check it out check it out
Dont go missing fly with me fly with me fly


Im tryna do it all tonight I got plans
I got a certain lust for life and as it stands
Everything is going as right as it can
They tryna shoot down my flight before it lands before it lands
But you could miss me with all that
Diss me then crawl back
I really wish yall would fall back
But gettin rich sposed to solve that
And these days women make offers
And who the hell am I to say No no no
My ex sendin late night texts
Cause she dont know how to let Go go go
Uh she in love
And as for them pretty lightskinned models
Standin in the cold ah yeah they with us
Let them girls in for a drink and Im all in they ear
Sayin she should be the one I see every time that Im here
But when am I really even here
Black Suburban with the tint on it
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it
The game got these old handprints on it
But Imma be the one to pour cement on it
Uh and start over
And show up in a Margiela tux I dont really give a fuck
And we only gettin older
So what I tend to do is to think of today as the past
Its funny when you comin in first but you hope that you last
You just hope that it last

Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up in the air for her ohoh
Throw your ones up in the air
Throw your ones up


My name is Drizzy and I aint perfect
But I work hard so I deserve it
And I belong right where you see me
Aint on the fence about it I aint Mr Feeny
Nah I got a decent set of manners
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or a planner
And I fall in love with girls caught up in superficial glamour
Who dress like Sarah Jessica and live like Princess Diana
So often they have addictions and Im the one thatll feed it
But truly youre bad enough that yall dont even really need it
You could show up at the party on dirty public transit
And I guarantee the cameraman will still be snappin candids
Of you and your posse partyin drinkin what you get handed
With your Virgin Island tans all lookin like you just landed
I dont really understand it Im not sure Im comprehendin
But these girls are having fun with whoevers money they spendin screamin


Spending every moment in the studio
I never said itd be fair
But when youre all alone I hope you truly know
How bad I want to be there

Come right in set your bag down
Took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
Theyre fittin for what Im about to do oh
Know you hate explaining how you want it done
Just be quiet Ill do fine without your help girl
Can you work without a second for some fun
Now you finally got a moment to yourself girl
And I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it

Come right in set your bag down
I took a night off for you
Go ahead and turn the lights off
But keep your heels on
Theyre fittin for what Im about to do oh
Know you hate explaining how you want it done
Just be quiet Ill do fine without your help girl
Can you work without a second for some fun
Now you finally got a moment to yourself girl
And I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it
I know what to do with it


This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do youre used to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who youve been with
Thats when I gotta hide what Im feeling inside
So you still think Im confident and damn
Is this gonna last
Youre up on a pedestal are we moving too fast
Feel like Im in crazy competition with the past
Thats why I gotta ask

Is anything Im doin brand new
Brand new Brand new brand new Brand new brand new
Is anything Im doin brand new
Is anything Im doin brand new
Brand new Brand new brand new brand new brand new
Oh girl Ayy ayy ayy

This here is something personal
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know
That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside
So I dont ever question you and damn
I cant even find the perfect brush
So I can paint whats going through my mind
Racing against myself but Im a couple steps behind
Thats why I gotta ask

Is anything Im doin brand new
Brand new Brand new brand new Brand new brand new
Is anything Im doin brand new
Is anything Im doin brand new
Brand new Brand new brand new brand new brand new
Oh girl Ayy ayy ayy
Is anything Im doin brand new
New new new new new
Or is everything Im doing too late
Late late late late

Did he take your clothes off just like this
Did he give you loving just like this
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date
Tell me baby am I too late

Is anything Im doin brand new
Brand new Brand new brand new Brand new brand new
Show me if this is brand new Brand new
Is anything Im doin brand new
New new new Brand new oh yeah yeah yeah


Yeah I appreciate your patience tonight
Its been a moment since Ive done some public speaking
I find nowadays its you know best to keep quiet
But uh sometimes you just gotta let it out
Young Angel and Young Lion you know what it is

Uh look Im the property of October
I aint drive here I got chauffeured
Bring me champagne flutes rosé and some shots over
I think better when Im not sober
I smoke goodie no glaucoma Im a stockholder
Private flights back home no stop over
Still spittin that shit that they shot Pac over
The shit my mother look shocked over
Yeah but with a canvas Im the Group of Seven
A migraine take two Excedrin
Im the one twice over Im the new eleven
And if I die Ima do it reppin I never do a second
I swear niggas be eyein me all hard
And lyin to they girls and drivin the same cars
Sittin there wishin their problems became ours
Cause we have nothin in common since I done became star
I done became bigger swervin writin in my peers lane
Same dudes that used to holler my engineers name
One touch I could make the drapes and the sheers change
And show me the city that I without fear claim
What I set seems to never extinguish
Coolest kid out baby word to Chuck Inglish
Count my own money see the paper cut fingers
My song is your girlfriends wakingup ringer
Heh or alarm or whatever
She be here at six in the morn if I let her
But I never get attracted to fans
Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam
I always knew that I could figure
How to get these label heads to offer him good figures
And me doin the shows gettin everyone nervous
Cause them hipsters gon have to get along with them hood niggas
Its all good Im goin off like lights when the shows over
Make pasta rent a movie call hoes over
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger but Im no joker
Ill slow roast ya got no holster
Wet glass on your table nigga no coaster
Burn bread everyday boy no toaster
G and Tez got a SIG but Im no smoker
They just handin chips to me nigga no poker
Im with it Young Money Cash Money soldier
My cup runneth over
The same niggas I ball with I fall with
On some southern drawl shit
Rookie of the year six Chris Paul shit
DR CJ and Po I see yall
These cases dont work out I hope we can agree on
Makin enough to pay any Judge Judy off
First thing Ima do is free Weezy go


One time for the homie DJ Screw
Already Im feeling throwed in this bitch

Up so high even when Im coming down
Just met a girl say she from the HTown
I say my name is Drizzy and aint nobody realer
Cup inside a cup smoking Ghostface Killah
Got these boppas going crazy nigga Im the man
I sent ya girl a message said Ill see ya when I can
She sent me one back but I aint never read it
Cause pussys only pussy and I get it when I need it

And Im telling you Im as cold as windows down in the winter
And I be riding rims if my tires any thinner
Airport stunting flying charters overseas
Full of Dom Perignon and the water for the Ds
Dont know why it happens everytime we alone
But here we are again and I swear Im in my zone
So Ima sip this drank until that muhfucka gone
And you gon get undressed and we gon get it on

I dont give you the time you deserve from me
This is something I know I know I know
So tonight Ill just fuck you like were in Houston
Taking everything slow so slow so slow
But I do it to her

Draped up dripped out know what Im talking bout
three in the morning get it popping in the parking lot
Its on once again and I never pretend
A nigga staying G til the end

Ayy yeah
I swear like everytime we find ourself in this situation you know
I just get that feeling like Im in Houston
Candy paint switching colors in the light
Its about like eleven PM and you just rolling through the city
Bumping that Screw Big Moe UGK Lil Keke
It feel like like everythings just moving slow
Lets take my time I pace it baby yeah Im gone


Why do I feel so alone
Like everybody passing through the studio
Is in character as if he acting out a movie role
Talking bullshit as if it was for you to know
And I dont have the heart
To give these bitch niggas the cue to go
So they stick around kicking out feedback
And I entertain it as if I need that
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that
My privacy about the only thing I need back but
Its hard to think of them polite flows
When Stefano Pilati suits are your night clothes
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes
And you still make it even when they say your flight closed
Eyes hurting from the camera phone light shows
Life was so full now this shit just being lipod
Always said Id say it all on the right track
But in this game you only lose when you fight back
Black diamond bracelets showing you the basics
I cant live and hold the camera someone gotta tape this
And make hits like a bitch thats married I aint miss
twenty-four hours from greatness Im that close
Dont ever forget the moment you began to doubt
Transitioning from fitting in to standing out
Los Angeles Cabanas or Atlanta South
Watchin Hovs show embarrassed to pull my camera out
And my mother embarrassed to pull my Phantom out
So I park about five houses down
She say I shouldnt have it until I have the crown
But I dont wanna feel the need to wear disguises around
So she wonder where my mind is accounts in the minus
But yet Im rolling round the fuckin city like your highness
Got niggas reactin without a sinus
Cause what Im working with is timeless
And promoters try to get me out to they club
And say I have fun but I cant imagine how
Cause I just seen my exgirl standing with my next girl
Standing with the girl that Im fuckin right now
And shit could get weird unless they all down
And so I stay clear we from a small town
And everybody talks and everybody listen
And somehow the truth just always comes up missing
Ive always been something that these labels cant buy
Especially if they tryin to take a piece of my soul
And Sylvia be tellin Tez Damn Drake fly
And he just be like Silly motherfucker I know
That was your bad how could you pass up on em
He just take them records and he gas up on em
Wayne will prolly put a million cash up on em
Surprised no one ever put your ass up on em
Oh they did Po at least they tried to
And thats what happen when you spitting whats inside you
But slip up and shoot the wrong fucking video
And they think they can market you however they decide to
Nah but forty told me to do me
And dont listen to anybody that knew me
Cause to have known me would mean that theres a new me
And if you think I changed in the slightest coulda fooled me
Boy and to my city Im the twenty-three
Drug dealers live vicariously through me
I quit school and its not because Im lazy
Im just not the social type and campus life is crazy
Understand I could get money with my eyes closed
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll
Sell that mothafucka to any rapper that I know
Cause they need it much more than I ever will
I got new shit Im gettin better still
Little niggas put my name in they verses
Cause they girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal
Future said Cause this Ye shit you better kill
And I think this got this MakingofaLegend feel
Problem with these other niggas they aint never real

Yeah thats all I can say


Uh
Im just so far gone
Octobers own
Please leave me alone
Drunk off champagne
Screamin in the phone
See my house is not a home
Fuck is going on
Where did we go wrong
Where do we belong
Caught up in the game and its one I cant postpone
Meanin if it rains Im the one its rainin on
When my diamond chain is on still nothin set in stone
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne
And tell me dont forget em and I promise that I wont
Feelin so distant from everyone Ive known
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone
Places we get flown parties that weve thrown
Ive done more for this city than these rappers that have blown
Its only been three years
Look at how Ive grown
Im just in my zone
I call this shit the calm
Yeah but Im the furthest thing from calm
Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond
Everything will be okay and it wont even take that long
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm
Leader of the new school its proven and its known
Im sittin in a chair but in the future its a throne
I know you like to worry itll be better if you dont cause

You know everything gon be all right I promise
I apologize to you know put yall in this position vent to yall but
forty Mama always say dont ask permission
Just ask forgiveness you know so uh forgive me yeah yeah
Say

Uh
And life is so insane
Look what I became trying to make a name
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain
They love it when you smile unaware that its a strain
Its a curse you gotta live with when you born to entertain
Women need attention therefore women will complain
Develop hatred for men and say that youre the one to blame
Tryin to enjoy myself with Tez in Miami at the game
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne
Its a weight thats on my chest whoever spotting me is playing
So Im lifting all alone trying not to get a sprain
Hoping Western Union doing currency exchange
Cause my dad called and got me feeling guilty and ashamed
Like how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range
And he paying for his cigarettes with dollars and some change
Damn and I can only feel his pain
Cause in Memphis Tennessee theres only so much to attain
So Im filling out the form at the counter once again
He say he love me I just hope he doesnt say that shit in vain
Im why your girl heart is in a sling
Call me Heartbreak Drake Im the hardest one to tame
As a man Im just honest as an artist Im a king
With my own set of problems that be sitting on my brain
Yeah and see this is the thang
What they viewing as bragging is the way that I maintain
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane
Is the singlehanded reason I remain me yeah

Uh
I said I call this shit the calm
But Im the furthest thing from calm
Swear Im putting on
But they always wanna ask what type of act you putting on like
Man


Gotta do what I gotta do

All my exes live in Texas like Im George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where tuition is handled
By some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited
I took her for sushi she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go told them dont even plate it
And we never talk too much after I blew up
Just only hello or a happy belated
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And thats when she text me and told me she prayed it
And thats when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after texted and told her Im faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer
I learned working with the negatives
Could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though its fucked up girl Im still fucking with ya
Damn is it the fall time for me to revisit the past
Its women to call theres albums to drop
Theres liquor involved
Theres stories to tell we been through it all
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room confusing me with questions like

Do you love this shit Are you high right now
Do you ever get nervous
Are you single I heard you fucked your girl is it true
You getting money
You think them niggas you with is with you
And I say hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah
Fuckin right fuckin right alright
And we say hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah
Fuckin right damn right alright
And we say hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah
Fuckin right fuckin right alright
And we say hell yeah hell yeah hell yeah
Fuckin right damn right alright yeah

People around you should really have nothing to say
Me Im just proud of the fact that youve done it your way
And the weekends here started it right

Live for today plan for tomorrow party tonight party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If theyre the ones that tell you that you do the right thing

Houston girls love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down
Vegas girls love the way it goes down

But I gotta say oh baby oh baby why is this so familiar
Just met her already feel like I know the real her
You musta done this before this cant be your first time
We musta been here before its still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for but wont find
You musta done this before this cant be your first time

They keep telling me dont save you if I ignore all that advice
Then something isnt right then who will I complain to
But the weekends here started it right

Cause you got a past and I do too were perfect for each other

Houston girls love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down

That I made it Yeah I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And youre wasted with your latest
Yeah Im the reason why you always getting faded

Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
A shot for me

Ok look Im honest Girl I cant lie I miss you
You and the music were the only things that Id commit to
I never cheated for the record back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me girl I dont get you
She says I know you changed
I never see you cause youre always busy doing things
I really wish she had a different way of viewing things
I think the city that were from just kinda ruined things
Its such a small place not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends telling you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your Mr Perfect
I could tell that you been crying all night drinking all summer
Prayin for your happiness hope that you recover
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And its worse because you know that I deserve it

Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me

May your neighbors respect you
Trouble neglect you
Angels protect you
And heaven accept you


Its like nine in your basement
And Im in love with Nebby
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasnt ready
And your back hurt and your neck hurt
And you smoking heavy
And I sit next to you and I lecture you
Because those are deadly
And then you ash it and we argue
About spending money on bullshit
And you tell me Im just like my father
My one button you push it
Now its Fuck you I hate you Ill move out in a heartbeat
And I leave out and you call me you tell me that you sorry
You love me and I love you
And your heart hurts mine does too
And its just words and they cut deep
But its our world its just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter
I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldnt have worked this hard
If you were healthy and it werent so bad
Uh maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
Cause leave it up to me J and Neeks
Well probably end up robbing the bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasnt that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh its my time yeah its on
Hes thinking of signing me I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your sonman that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
I get to make good on my promise
It all worked out girl we shoulda known
Cause you deserve it

Is this shit real Should I pinch you
After all the things that we been through I got you
Look what youve done look what youve done
Look what youve done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When youre stressed out and you need something I got you
Look what youve done look what youve done

Its like six in your backyard
Im in love with Jade
And Im still in love cus when its that real
Is when it doesnt fade
And my father living in Memphis now he cant come this way
Over some minor charges and child support
That just wasnt paid damn
Boohoo sad storyblack American dad story
Know that Im your sisters kid
But it still dont explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you man this all new shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fighting going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think Im done acting
Im more in touch with the music
You said either way Ill be a star I could go so far
Talked to me you got to me
Then youd toss the keys and loan me your car
Yeah just a young kid in a drop top
Lexus hopin that I dont get arrested
Just another kid thats going through life
So worried that I wont be accepted
But I could do anything you said that and you meant that
You took me places you spent that
They said no we went back
Checks bounced but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you I dont know where
Id really be without that it worked out
Man you deserve it

Is this shit real Should I pinch you
After all the things that we been through I got you
Look what youve done look what youve done
Look what youve done for me now
You knew that I was gonna be something
When youre stressed out and you need something I got you
Look what youve done look what youve done

Hi Aubrey Im here sitting with my son having a little talkand he knows how to get in touch with you now to let you know how grateful I am for your help in keeping me in thisin this comfortable place All I can say Aubrey is I remember the good times we had together and the times I used to look after you And I still have wonderful feelings about that So God bless you and I hope Ill see you


I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good itll make the shit last
Dont make it too easy girl dont take it too fast
Yeah thats it right there
Thats it do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Mightve been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and youve always been the one
One I wonder why the moon looks nice girl
Maybe its just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong girl
They want you in their life as a wife
Thats why you want to have no sex why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
Cause you dont love them boys
Pussy run everything fuck that noise

I know things get hard but girl you got it
Girl you got it there you go
Cant you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go
Wondering whats on your mind it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
Its just amazing girl and all I can say is
Im so Im so Im so Im so Im so  proud of you
Im so Im so Im so Im so Im so  proud of you
Im so Im so Im so Im so Im so  proud of you

Everythings adding up youve been through hell and back
Thats why youre bad as fuck and you

I know things get hard but girl you got it
Girl you got it there you go
Cant you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go
Wondering whats on your mind it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
Its just amazing girl all I can say is
Im so Im so Im so Im so Im so  proud of you
Im so Im so Im so Im so Im so  proud of you
Im so Im so Im so Im so Im so  proud of you

Everythings adding up youve been through hell and back
Thats why youre bad as fuck and you know you are

And I know all I can say is

And I know all I can say is

Everythings adding up youve been through hell and back
Thats why youre bad as fuck and you know you are


Ive asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didnt change and I still feel the same
Whats a life with no fun Please dont be so ashamed
Ive had mine youve had yours we both know we know
They wont get you like I will my only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you cant sleep thinking that he lies still
So you cry still tears all on the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste ah
Pushing me away so I give her space ah
Dealing with a heart that I didnt break
Ill be there for you I will care for you
I keep thinking you just dont know
Tryna run from that say you done with that
On your face girl it just dont show
When youre ready just say youre ready
When all the baggage just aint as heavy
And the partys over just dont forget me
Well change the pace and well just go slow
You wont ever have to worry you wont ever have to hide
Youve seen all my mistakes so look me in my eyes

Its my birthday Ill get high if I want to
Cant deny that I want you but Ill lie if I have to
Cause you dont say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do you do
One time been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that youre following your heart
Cause your mind dont control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though dont be so ashamed
Ive had mine youve had yours we both know we know
You hate being alone well you aint the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream
And they sold you one
You love your friends but somebody shouldve told you some
To save you instead they say


I hate when I hate when people say they feel me man I hate that shit
Itll be a long time before yall feel me if ever
Fo real

You wont feel me until everybody
Say they love you but its not love
And your suit is oxblood
And the girl you fucking hates you
And your friends faded off shots of
What you ordered to forget about the game that you on top of
Your famous girlfriends ass keep getting thicker than a plot does
And when you forget it thats when she pop up
And you got a drop but you ride around with the top up
Or get three SUVs for niggas dressed like refugees
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley
Scallops and glasses of Dolce that shits right up your alley
You see a girl and you ask about her
Bitches smiling at you it must be happy hour
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down
Its feeling like you own every place you choose to be at now
Walking through airport security with your hat down
Instead of getting a pat down they just keep on
Saying that they feel you nigga

You wont feel me til you want it so bad you tell yourself youre in it
And tell the world around you that your paperwork is finished
And steal your mothers debit cards so you maintain an image
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that aint tinted
You need a minute You got it
You know its real when your latest nights are your greatest nights
The sun is up when you get home thats just a way of life
Apartment one thousand, five hundred and three some couches and paintings
When you record with two others that want the same things
It start to feel better than home feels
And so you up there every night you swear you getting close
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills
But shit you bout to spend it on what matters most
You drop a couple songs in hopes that you could be the nigga
And come out every night to let the city see they nigga
Telling stories that nobody relate to
And even though they hate you
They just keep on telling you they feel you nigga

I havent been inside Terminal one and three in so long
Im driving right up to it now
Make sure you got your coat on
That runway can be cold especially after summers rolled on
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs
For four months out the year its got you asking whats good at home
Whats good at home
The same hoes are still at it I shoulda known
My young niggas popping Ms and sipping dirty jones
Problem children that all be repping Octobers Own
Brand new girl and she still growing
Brand new titties stitches still showing
Yeah and she just praying that it heals good
Im bout to fuck and Im just praying that it feels good
I really dont know much but shit I know a secret
They say more money more problems my nigga dont believe it
I mean sure theres some bills and taxes Im still evading
But I blew six million on myself and I feel amazing
Young money maker season ticket holder
Season switching over
I come through them bitches
Still scorching as if I didnt notice
You niggas getting older I see no threat in Yoda
Im out here messing over the lives of these niggas
That couldnt fuck with my freshman floater flow ta
Look at that fucking chip on your nephews shoulder
My sophomore I was all for it they all saw it
My juniors and senior will only get meaner
Take care nigga


I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin the consequence
Drinkin every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long Im floatin in and out of consciousness
And they sayin Im back Id agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off ooh I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up well whered I leave it at
I know I exaggerated things now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt cause Im just mobbin like that
You know good and well that you dont want a problem like that
You gon make someone around me catch a body like that
No dont do it please dont do it
Cause one of us goes in and we all go through it
And Drizzy got the money so Drizzy gonna pay it
Those my brothers I aint even gotta say it
Thats just something they know

They know they know they know
They know they know they know
They know they know they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys
I even gave em a chance to decide
Now its something they know
They know they know they know

I be yellin out Money over everything Money on my mind
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize happened over time
She says they miss the old Drake girl dont tempt me
If they dont get it theyll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do
Im like Why I gotta be all that
But still I cant deny the fact that its true
Listening to you expressin all them feelings
Soap opera rappers all these niggas sound like All My Children
And thats who you thinkin is about to come and make a killin
I guess it really is just me myself and all my millions
You know that they aint even got it like that
You gon hype me up and make me catch a body like that
Cause I live for this it isnt just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it
I aint even gotta say it they know

They know they know they know
They know they know they know
They know they know they know
Yeah they know yeah
That the real is on the rise
Fuck them other guys

I be yelling out Money over everything
Money on my mind
Tell them I apologize it happened over time
They know
They know they know they know
They know they know they know
They know they know they know
Yeah

I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies
Rather hear what was or will be than what is
Rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you
Rather hear about findin yourself than how you lost you
Rather you make this an open letter
About family and struggle and it takin forever
About hearts that youve broken and ties that youve severed
No doubt in my mind thatll make them feel better


I think I killed erybody
In the game last year man fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams
At a strip club mmmmmm fuck it I was wrong though
Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
Nowadays its six figures when they tax me
Oh well I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls let the lights dim some
Shots came I dont know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes Im bout to take the hint from
Yeah you know me well nigga
I mean you aint the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga
Slave to the pussy but Im just playing the field nigga
Are these people really discussing my career again
Asking if Ill be going platinum in a year again
Dont I got the shit the world wanna hear again
Dont Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in
Man all of your flows bore me paint drying
And I dont ever be trippin off of what aint mine
And I be hearing the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
Yeah its been that way from the beginning
I just been playing I aint even notice I was winning

And this is the only sound you should fear
Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

You say Im old news well who the new star
Cause if Im going anywhere its probably too far
Just performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brothers case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggas thats doing dead time
Shout out to the bitches there when its bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think its their time

You know feeling good living better

But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album Im back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together I hope she frames it
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like Ive been here before huh
I still got ten years to go huh

And this is the only sound you should fear
Man these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

Yeah
Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess well never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really I think I like who Im becoming
Theres times where I might do it just to do it like its nothing
Theres times when I might blow like fiftyk on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones thatll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story and made history
Tell them Ima need reservations for twenty
Ive never really been one for the preservation of money nah
Much rather spend it all while Im breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in I know


Bridge over troubled water ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldnt be driving it just got so much harder
Cant even see straight I cant even see it straight
Uh fuck with me I buy the shots
Live a little cause niggas die a lot
And lie a lot but Im the truth  thats right I fucking said it
The living proof that you aint gotta die to get to heaven
You girl you right there you look like you like this shit
Howd I know howd I know Thats me on some psychic shit
I can tell a lie if you ask me my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches rappin bitches bitches
And rappin rappin and bitches until all of it switches
I swear its been two years since somebody asked me who I was
Im the greatest man I said that before I knew I was
Thats whats important what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing Walking like a man finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket Im a uptown nigga ah
With fame on my mind my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days Acura days
I was a cold dude Im getting back to my ways

People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave Im an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause Im down to spend whatever lately Ive been on a roll
And I do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city UGK fuck these other niggas

Sometimes I need that romance
Sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper
Thats gon tell me that she dont dance
Tell me lies make it sound good make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all the good things thats all Im really good for
Memphis Tennessee no see I start to go deep back
And Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and EMack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowing in they mouth
And they rockin furs like its snowing in the south
And every pretty girl tell me thats the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who Im trying to be like
So I drop out lessons I was taught are quick to fade
As soon I realize that turning papers in wont get me paid
And if I dont do nothing Imma ball
Im counting all day like a clock on the wall
Yeah I need that making major changes to the life Im living
I had no choice I had to prove I made the right decisions
That was back in the days Acura days
I was a cold dude Im getting back to my ways

People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave Im an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
Cause Im down to spend whatever lately Ive been on a roll
And I do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city UGK fuck these other niggas


Its your worst nightmare its my first night here
And this girl right here who knows what she knows
So Im going through her phone if she go to the bathroom
And her purse right there I dont trust these hoes at all
But thats just the result of me paying attention
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions
Talking strippers and models that try to gain attention
Even a couple pornstars that Im ashamed to mention
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models
Haffa and Jordan my only role models
Thats why I walk around with all this gold on
And every time I run into these niggas they want no problems
Bottom sixes and chains and some bracelets and rings
All of the little accents that make me a king
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me
But its whatever if somebody wont make it a thing
Im more concerned with niggas thinkin bout Christmas in August
Do anything to buy gifts for they daughters
Get some shake a brick in the press
And chef it like Mrs Fields theyre making the cookie stretch
I know it so well I know the hustle so well
Stunt like Im working overnighters right by the motel
Drug money outfit record clean
Spend it all on me and my fuckin team
Matchin Rollies for real matchin Rovers for real woo
Places they say theyve been we actually going for real woo
Im really killin shit fuck all the jiggy rapping woo
Im going trigger happy just to see my niggas happy woo
Mixtape legend underground kings
Lookin for the right way to do the wrong things huh
With my new bitch thats living in Palm Springs
Young ass nigga lifelong dreams
They take the greats from the past and compare us
I wonder if theyd ever survive in this era
In a time where its recreation
To pull all your skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations
I know of all the things that I hear they be poking fun at
Never the flow though they know I run that
Fuck you all I claim that whenever
I changed rap forever the game back together yeah
YM I remain that forever
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever
Im a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix
I havent figured it out cause my story is far from finished
Im hearing all of the jokes I know that they tryna push me
I know that showin emotion dont ever mean Im a pussy
Know that I dont make music for niggas who dont get pussy
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me
Lord knows Lord knows Im heavy I got my weight up
Roberson boost your rate up its time that somebody paid up
A lot of niggas came up off of a style that I made up
But if all I hear is me then who should I be afraid of
Bought a white Ghost now shit is gettin spooky
Very very scary like shit you see in the movies
In this bitch all drinks on the house like Snoopy
Thats why all the real soldiers salute me
Trill nigga for real

When a good thing goes bad its not the end of the world
Its just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And shes the reason it happened but shes overreacting
And its all because she dont want things to change

So cry if you need to but I cant stay to watch you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to but I cant stay to hold you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to but I cant stay to hear you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Cause youll say you love me and Ill end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it oh ho you know it
Oh ho you know it we both know it
I need someone different
You know it oh ho you know it
Oh ho you know it we both know it
Somethings been missing
You know it oh ho she knows it
Oh ho I know it we all know it
I need someone different
Oh ho oh ho

We live in a generation of not being in love
And not being together
But we sure make it feel like were together
Because were scared to see each other with somebody else

So cry if you need to but I cant stay to watch you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to but I cant stay to hold you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to but I cant stay to hear you
Thats the wrong thing to do
Cause youll say you love me and Ill end up lying
And say I love you too

But I need someone different
You know it oh ho you know it
Oh ho you know it we both know it
I need someone different
You know it oh ho you know it
Oh ho you know it we both know it
Somethings been missing
You know it oh ho she knows it
Oh ho I know it we all know it
I need someone different
Oh ho oh ho


Diplomatic immunity fuck em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shitll ruin me fuck em yeah
Cause niggas started talkin to me like Im slowin down
Opinions over statistics of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all youll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wallys waiter twistin the cork
I got multicolored rings like the Olympics of course
At award shows cuttin through the tension of course
Girls huggin me then askin me What scent that is boy
I be walkin around the Six like I invented it boy
Yeah who am I The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us but
Like a job straight outta high school theres no you and I
I taught you everything you know now you got student pride
All factual I call the house the embassy
The studio the chapel I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solána show the girls a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah the furthest Ive been thats word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential I broke all the codes for zonin in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isnt much of a sacred temple with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and Ill bury you where they wont find ya
Motor City Casino Im at the cage with my old license
They tell me dont worry I got your money like Osirus
Im the Osiris of this shit
Dirty thirty workin on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi Robyns favorite
Shit is nice but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin preggo
Wakin up at six PM like Where does the day go
Forecastin tornadoes brainstormin retaliation at dinner tables
two thousand and ten was when I lost my halo
two thousand and seventeen I lost a J Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards I claimed thirteen out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence but I guess when it comes to me its not the same though all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldnt
Niggas stakin out the crib its all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas round tall ladies
I gotta watch who Im talkin to like its allages
Ive seen buddin careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers judgin their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears my security government tier
Yeah advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least its expected
Tell em I dont wanna link like a broken necklace
Ill be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror mirror on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin Al Jazeera
Inshallah I hope the mission keeps on gettin clearer
Whenever wherever OVO will always be together like Shakira

I love I love
I love I love it
Baby I


I just love when Im with you yeah this shit is on ten
We used to be friends girl and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and youd tell me baby its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his WuTang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it they say its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody its yours
Its yours its yours its yours thats for sure thats for sure
Its yours its yours its yours thats for sure thats for sure

How you feel about comin home with a nigga for the night
If you nervous hit the lights I know we only fuckin out of spite
Cause your man dont do you right do you right I could fuck you so good
Then I hit you with the nine am in Dallas who you like baby who you like

Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life it aint about who did it first
Its bout who did it right niggas looking like Preach
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that its harder in the streets I know
Luckily I didnt have to grow there
I would only go there cause niggas that I know there
I dont know whats getting into me I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You aint ever worried cause hes not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory things change in that life
And this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin with me mentally I think its meant to be
Paranoid always rolling with my mothafuckin boys
But you gotta understand when its yours
They dont really leave your ass with a mothafuckin choice man

I just love when Im with you yeah this shit is on ten
We used to be friends girl and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and youd tell me baby its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody its yours
Nobody elses yeah this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his WuTang

Done sayin Im done playin
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house need to get out more
Ive been stackin up like Im fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls and they end  up on them front pages
Im quiet with it I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it Ill be done with it
Im the only one thats putting shots up
And like a potluck you need to come with it
Dont run from it like HTown in the summertime I keep it one hundred
Met a lot of girls in my times there word to Paul Wall not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year man I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in nine like Is Bun coming
Fuck that is anyone comin fore I show up there and theres no one there
These days I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing Ive been stressed out
Talkin to her like back then they didnt want me Im blessed now
Talkin to her like this drop bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me Take a deep breath youre too worried about being the best out

Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners no holidays no nothin
Theres issues at hand that were not discussin
I did not sign up for this
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now hes actin like Oh well this is life I guess Nah fuck that shit
Listen man you can still do what you wanna do you gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign thats when they appear
Guess since my text message didnt resonate Ill just say it here
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment telling herself
That shes too sick to get dressed up and go do shit like thats true shit
And all my family from the MTown that Ive been round started treating me like Im him now
Like we dont know each other we aint grow together we just friends now
Shit got me feeling pinned down pick the pen up or put the pen down
Im writing to you from a distance like a pen pal but weve been down

Somewhere between psychotic and iconic
Somewhere between I want it and I got it
Somewhere between Im sober and Im lifted
Somewhere between a mistress and commitment
But I stay down girl I always stay down get down never lay down
Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now so much on my plate now
People I believed in they dont even show they face now
What they got to say now Nothin they can say now
Nothin really changed but still they look at me a way now
What more can I say now What more can I say now
You might feel like nothin was the same

I still been drinkin on the low mobbin on the low
Fuckin on the low smokin on the low
I still been plottin on the low schemin on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know
I just been drinkin on the low mobbin on the low
Fuckin on the low smokin on the low
I just been plottin on the low schemin on the low
The furthest thing from perfect like everyone I know

And I hate that you dont think I belong to ya
Just too busy runnin shit to run home to ya
You know that paper my passion
Bittersweet celebrations I know I cant change what happened
I cant help it I cant help it I was young and I was selfish
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one elses
And now you hate me stop pretendin stop that frontin I cant take it
Girl dont treat me like a stranger girl you know I seen you naked

Your actions make us doubt you
Your lack of effort got me rappin different

Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin
Naked women swimmin thats just how Im livin
Donate a million to some children thats just how Im feelin
A nigga fillin up arenas who the fuck could see us

Same old pimp Drake you know aint nothin changed

I just ask for some blessings at my grandmothers grave
Then its back to LA open the mail starin at the check
Enough to make you throw up man its gross what I net

Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you bitch Im more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This aint the son you raised who used to take the Acura

Isnt it amazing how you talk all this shit and we still lack communication
How beautiful our kids would be girl I dont need convincing
How every conversation starts with this time will be different
Oh the idea is fun oh the idea is fun
Oh the idea is so fun every time
At least we try for home run every time

Swanging eyes closed just swanging
Same city same friends if youre looking for me
Same city same friends if youre looking
Ill be here just swanging
Dont talk to me like Im famous
And dont assume cause I dont respect assumptions bae
Im just tryna connect with somethin baby
Yeah swanging

She just wanna run around the city and make memories
That she can barely remember
And Id allow her talk about pussy power
She just wanna run over my feelings
Like she drinking and driving in an eighteen wheeler
And Id allow her talk about pussy power
She used to say You can be whoever you want even yourself
Yeah I show up knowin exactly who I was and never leave as myself
But when it falls apart Im always still down
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground
Wish you would learn to love people and use things
And not the other way around

Swanging eyes closed just swanging
Same city same friends if youre looking for me
Same city same friends if youre looking
Ill be here just swanging
Dont talk to me like Im famous
And dont assume cause I dont respect assumptions bae
Im just tryna connect with somethin baby
Ill be here just swanging

I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is
She call and tell me be here before the sun up
I be dressed before we hung up
I take Eglinton to four hundred and one east
And exit at Markham road in the east end
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend
Fuck I know I said that shit the last seven weekends
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness
I hate stoppin for gas this late
Cause theres niggas creepin and not like how were creepin

I dont know who youre referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about
Someone just talking that bullshit

Niggas downplayin the money

It could all be so simple
Talkin that shit with you back to me

Come get your girl she been here for three days
And she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road

And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Cant even drive with the top off

Comin off the last record Im gettin twenty million off the record
Just to off these records nigga thats a record
Im livin like Im out here on my last adventure
Past the present when you have to mention
This is nothin for the radio but theyll still play it though
Cause its that new Drizzy Drake thats just the way it go
Heavy airplay all day with no chorus
We keep it thorough nigga rap like this for all of my borough niggas
I reached the point where dont shit matter to me nigga
I reached heights that Dwight Howard couldnt reach nigga
Prince Akeem they throw flowers at my feet nigga
I could go a hour on this beat nigga
Im just as famous as my mentor
But thats still the boss dont get sent for
Get hype on tracks and jump in front of a bullet you wasnt meant for
Cause you dont really wanna hear me vent more
Hot temper scary outcome
Heres a reason for niggas thats hatin without one
That always let they mouth run
Bench players talkin like starters I hate it
Started from the bottom now we here nigga we made it
Yeah Tom Ford Tuscan Leather smellin like a brick
Degenerates but even Ellen love our shit
Rich enough that I dont have to tell em that Im rich
Self explanatory you just here to spread the story wassup

Sittin Gucci Row like they say up at UNLV
Young rebel Young Money nothin you could tell me
Paperwork takin too long maybe they dont understand me
Ill compromise if I have to I gotta stay with the family
Not even talkin to Nicki communication is breakin
I dropped the ball on some personal shit I need to embrace it
Im honest I make mistakes Id be the second to admit it
Think thats why I need her in my life to check me when Im trippin
On a mission tryna shift the culture
Tell me who dissin I got some things thatll hit the culprit
Them strep throat flows them shits to stop all of the talkin
All of the talkin got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think Im too busy thats why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like aye B I got your CD you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin reckless
Owl chains like credentials you know you see the necklace
My lifes a completed checklist
Im tired of hearin bout who you checkin for now
Just give it time well see whos still around a decade from now
Thats real

How much time is this nigga spendin on the intro
Lately Ive been feelin like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters Im just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna talk to em
The fresh prince just had dinner with Tatyana no lie
All these ninetys fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if youre fine
Thats just me on my solo like fuck it like YOLO
Wanted to tell you Accept yourself
You dont have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin some extra help then I could help
You know back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin on the intro
How this nigga workin like he got a fuckin twin though
Life is soundin crazy forty on Martin Scorsese
And I wouldnt change a thing if you paid me now real nigga wassup
How much time is this nigga spendin on the intro

If theres hell below Ill see you when you get there Are you enjoyin yourselves If we may wed just like to close off with somethin a bit inspirational Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears shedding similar tears and of course dying in so many years It dont mean that we cant have a good life So wed like to just maybe close out with something some food for thought for all of us

Guess whose it is Guess whose it is
Guess whose it is Its yours

Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Just let that shit sink in ha
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin these days
Bunch of journalists been searchin for a story
My exgirl been searchin for a sorry
Couple bitches tryna have me on the Maury
Like nigga its yours you should be supportin
But where you been at On tour gettin money
Yall dont even really check for me
You aint even hit me when that nigga had threats for me girl
You dont love me you just say that shit to get to me girl
Cause you got the Batphone and my workline you should call
When the last time you did somethin for the first time
You done done it all
I swear to God niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin that Im different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you shit switches these days
Its yours its yours its yours its its always gonna be yours


I needed to hear that shit I hate when youre submissive
Passive aggressive when were texting I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but dont make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money pussy vacation
And influence a generation thats lacking in patience
Ive been dealing with my dad speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
Weve been talking bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down girl that niggas amazing
Well fuck it we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child beautiful child Im in your zone
Looking like you came from the seventys on your own
My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone
You dont even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something Im missing and disappear when Im bored
But girl what qualities was I looking for before
Who you settling for Who better for you than the boy huh

Thinking bout Texas back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my mommas debit
A weak attempt at flexing Ill never forget it
Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how Ill never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now its therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macys where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
Ive always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married whats the rush on commitment
Know we were going through some shit name a couple that isnt
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how Im living I just hope Im forgiven
It seem like you dont want this love anymore
Im acting out in the open its hard for you to ignore
But girl what qualities was I looking for before
Who you settling for Who better for you than the boy huh


Yeah after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto just talkin women and vino
The contract like ninety-one Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapinos boosting my ego
Overly focused its far from the time to rest now
Debates growin bout who they think is the best now
Took a while got the jokers out of the deck now
Im holdin all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it I dont even tint it they should know whos in it
Im authentic real name no gimmicks
No game no scrimmage I aint playin with you niggas at all
My classmates they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn bridges burn you live and learn
With the ink I could murder word to my nigga Irv
Yeah I swear shit just started clickin dog
You know its real when you are who you think you are

Look fuck all that Happy to be here shit that yall want me on
Im the big homie they still be tryna lil bro me dog
Like I should fall in line like I should alert niggas
When Im bout to drop somethin crazy
And not say Im the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didnt study the game to the letter
And understand that Im not doin it the same
Man Im doing it better
Like I didnt make that clearer this year
Like I should feel I dont know guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here
So I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts
That I would share with myself
But I thought Fuck it its worth it to share em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to
I got a compound but I think shes straight
Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me
Out of the back room where I was rapping with Jas
Over beats that I shouldnt have in the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later Im his artist
He probably wouldnt remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldnt believe when he called me
You never know it could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit cause its somethin to do
Yeah I guess thats just who I became dawg
Nothing was the same dawg


Look who Im fuckin again
I had her on ice but then
I watched the ice get thin
Now does she sink or swim

She had an attitude in the summer
But she bein nice again

Top of the charts back in they hearts

Earthshatterin groundbreakin
Headscarf for after our relations
No judgment is our arrangement
Make that face up if you dare
But just be prepared that I am gonna cause that lipstick to smear
And the mascara tears to run down

Ayo blast that shit Maxx

Back and forth to Italy

Yall do not know the half of it
I grew up with the Reps Up boys we crashin it and splashin in
And when I say they crashin it I do not mean a accident
Im Im still in the studio at six hundred and forty-five
And my haters either on they way to work or they arrived
And I gotta own the things I rap about just for my pride
You know when it comes to pride I cant put that shit aside
Ive been kicked when I was down
None of that shit matter now
They be throwin in the towel
I do yellowtail at TAO
They be watchin what they say
Especially when its to my face
Everything will be okay
Man just stay up out my way

Skid around ends with the bros and Im kitted to the toes
If I touch studio then we got one
I be tryna laugh with the bros bout the opps that we know
But they cant take a joke cause its not one
Think its cause we live by the code reputation to uphold
Makin me the one they gotta take the spot from

This shit got me in my feelings
I just gotta be real with it yup
BlaqNmilD you a genius you diggin me


Here we go yeah

Yesterday morning was crazy
I had to come to terms with the fact that its not a maybe
That shit is in stone sealed and signed
She not my lover like Billie Jean but the kid is mine
Sandi used to tell me all it takes is one time
And all it took was one time
Shit we only met two times two times
And both times were nothin like the new times
Now its rough times Im out here on front lines
Just tryin to make sure that I see him sometimes
Its breakin my spirit
Single father I hate when I hear it
I used to challenge my parents on every album
Now Im embarrassed to tell em I ended up as a coparent
Always promised the family unit
I wanted it to be different because Ive been through it
But this is the harsh truth now
And fairy tales are saved for the bedtime stories I tell you now
I dont want you worry bout whose house you live at
Or who loves you more or whos not there
Who did what to who fore you got here
Nah look Im too proud
To let that come between me and you now
Realize I gotta think for two now
I gotta make it I better make it
I promise if Im not dead then Im dedicated
This the first positive DNA we ever celebrated
I cant forget the looks on they faces
Got the news in Miami that now we all got ones that we raisin
Tell Gelo bring some more Rosé and the Baccarats out
For our cheers to the next generation
But this Champagne toast is shortlived
I got an empty crib in my empty crib
I only met you one time introduced you to Saint Nick
I think he mustve brought you like twenty gifts
Your mother say you growin so fast that they dont even really fit
But man you know
I still had to get it for my boy though you know
You havent met your grandfather yet that nigga a trip
He probably coulda did standup
Yeah but at the same time hes a stand up
And thats how you gon be when its time to man up
October baby for ironys sake of course
I got this eleven tatted for somebody now its yours
And believe me I cant wait to get a hundred more
Sorry Im ventin tryna cover ground
They said that in two weeks youre supposed to come in town
Hopefully by the time you hear this
Me and your mother will have come around
Instead of always cuttin each other down
God willin I got a good feelin
You got a good spirit
Well talk more when you hear this my G

Im changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me Im all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
No one to guide me Im all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man
Im all alone
No one to cry on
I need shelter from the rain to ease the pain
Of changing from boy to a man


Yeah turn everything up
Yeah oh yeah
Turn everything up a little more

I want my baby to have your eyes
Im going against my own advice
Should I do New York I cant decide
Fashion week is more your thing than mine
I cant even lie Id rather stay inside
I cant do suit and tie
Cant be in a room with you and stand on different sides
One thing at a time
I have to learn to hide
One thing at a time
Emotions running high
I wish you felt alright

It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He cant know finesse
You stay on my mind

You and your sister
Too hot to handle
Things would get cancelled
I would make time for you
Commitment
Going the distance
Im new to all of this

It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He cant know finesse
You stay on my mind


Only holdin up I do is my end of the bargain
Only beggin that I do is me beggin your pardon
Only tryin that I do is me tryin the hardest
Only problems I do are math problems with profit
Only lyin I do is lyin out in the tropics
Only cryin I do is cryin from laughin bout it
Only lackin I can do is my lack of responses
Only rest that I do is Where the rest of my commas
Still I rise Maya Angelou vibes
When life comin at you from all angles and sides
And they dont wanna see that you smilin from inside
It really boils down to how you plan to survive
Love certain ones but never get attached to em
Give em nice things but whats that to em
Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin up in my bathroom
And they recognize the bathroom
All hell starts to break loose in my texts
I only tell lies to who I gotta protect
I would rather have you remember me how we met
I would rather lose my leg than lose their respect
But thatll never happen the way Im watchin my step
That aint what Im bout
Im in control of my destiny never in doubt
If I cant make it with you Ill make it without
They say take the good with the bad Ill take it without
Houston women I wineanddine and take to the house
My moral compass is janky it breaks in the South
Is there more to life than digits and bankin accounts
Is there more to life than sayin I figured it out
Is there more Yeah

Sweeter the berry the blacker the juice
The boy is back in the booth ready to tap into truth
Too many lyrics bout houses and loot
Too many Walt Disney characters mouses and goofs
I mean you know I love a challenge but challenged by who
Ill let you bring a thousand recruits
My peers are a talented group
But even if you take all their statistics and carry the two
Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops
Theres still nothin they could really do
Its too bad reality checks dont cover the balances due
Whenever its time to recoup
Yeah soon as this album drop Im out of the deal
In the house playin DAngelo How Does It Feel
I got a fear of havin things on my mind when I die
What you got time on your hands or time on your side
Is there any sense in doin these songs when Im high
Is there more to life than goin on trips to Dubai
Yachts on the fourth of July Gfive soarin the skies
Is there more to life than all of these corporate ties
And all of these fortunate times
And all of these asses that never come in proportionate size
Am I missin somethin thats more important to find
Like healin my soul like family time
Is there more to life than just when Im feelin alive
Is there more


Yeah no more no more
Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby
Yeah no more no more
Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby ooh
Yeah

Niggas see the crib and ask who did I steal from
Price tags on makin the world feel some
They dont have enough to satisfy a real one
Maverick Carter couldnt even get the deal done
Niggas scared to come towards us gotta run from us
Louisville hush money for my young gunners
Rick Pitino I take em to strip clubs and casinos
Stack of cnotes get all you niggas scratched like Preemo
Worms I just opened up a can of those
My mother had a flower shop but I was Sandras Rose
Two girls that I rope like Indiana Jones
I make them hoes walk together like Im Amber Rose
Yeah fuck that I got to up the ante
California girls sweeter than pieces of candy
Had me all in Nipsey hood to go link up with Sammy
Type of hood where bandanas make niggas a family
Head on a swivel I could shoot but I could never dribble
Life too short I gotta get it fore they blow the whistle
My uncle tryna change my energy with stones and crystals
But its gon take more than that for me to control my issues
I wasnt made for no casket or no prison cell
Every title doin numbers like Im Miss Adele
Sandra knows I pulled us out of a living hell
Im the chosen one flowers never pick themselves

Niggas want a classic thats just ten of these
Crime family like the Genovese
You dont want drama capisc
My house is full of supermodels just like Mohamed Hadid
I take this shit too serious you niggas my comic relief
I find it funny how I keep on talkin and commas increase
Im standin at the top of where you niggas are climbin to reach
I even got my very own initials inscribed on my sheets
Subtle reminders are key jeez
Spoiler alert the second act is tragic
And everyone that wants the worst for mes askin what happened
Backstabbed so many times I started walkin backwards
Like Charlamagne I see the light and see the darkest patches
Bury me and Ill be born again
I walk in godly form amongst the mortal men
I got some real demons across the border fence
And made a note of the mistakes we cant afford again
Like I said can of worms and Im the early bird
Niggas want to hang but Im too busy doin dirty work
Hit em back and say well link up on the thirty-threerd
When I say that they cursin me it aint dirty words
Church of Pentecost Holy Spirit synagogue
I dont know whos protectin me but we hit it off
Sandras rose no wonder they tryna pick me off
I guess you gotta show these niggas who you really are


I think youre changin your mind
Startin to see it in your eyes
I used to love a good surprise
And now Id rather know ahead of time
You said I love you too fast
So much for that girl summer just started
And were already done

Yeah you say I led you on but you followed me
I follow one of your friends you unfollow me
Then you block them so they cant see you likin someone just like me
I expected more from you honestly
Said you want a simple life and thats not me
How you go from that to endin up with someone just like

How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when its freezin outside
Youre confusin me dont have me wastin my time
Yeah you said I love you too fast
So much for that girl summer just started
And were already done

They keep tryna get me for my soul for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know that I know

All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
Theres no way that this is real man it cant be
Yeah yeah

If you need me you cant call me I stay busy makin money
You know what is on my mind all I think about is hunnids
I stay busy bzz workin on me
I stay busy with my business homie
I already hit her when you left her lonely
She is not the type that likes to take things slowly
Slowly my mouth is goin off I dont know patience
I got a chance then my niggas got it too like its contagious
I see the future when I get wavy Wavy God
But I couldnt picture bein Champagne haan when I would buy that shit and save it for the right occasion
I couldnt picture changes
When I was with Ms Creighton that lady hates me
Couldnt picture wifin Braden when I was pumpin gas on road trips to go from Cincinnati on to Dayton
I couldnt gauge it
I wanna thank God for workin way harder than Satan
Hes playin favorites it feels amazin yeah

Elevate elevate
Only obligation is to tell it straight
Me and all the guys found a better way
This a life bid we can never separate
Im in bed awake thinkin howd I make
All this happen for myself and my family
All this happen for myself and my family
Theres no way that this is real man it cant be

Yeah I can only tell you shit in pieces
As it happens to me I begin to write the thesis
Franny got the Aria setup like its a Freaknik
Vegas like Marineland that big whale treatment
Georgie got me up a hunnid thousand for the weekend
I gotta move the safe beside the bed when I be sleepin
My mood is changin this summer Ima be tweakin


Ayy ayy
Lot of sixs in here tonight
Yeah yeah ayy
Dopeman

Ten of us we movin as one
Im so proud of who Ive become
You might think Ive taken some lumps
Only if we talkin bout sums yeah
Intentions are pure they cannot tell me relax
My mentions are jokes but they never give me the facts
This isnt that cant be ignorin the stats
Based off of that they gotta run me the max
They gotta run me the max they gotta double the racks
They had it set up for real but they didnt come with the slaps
When I heard the shit I was skippin through that
If I get it trippin its no comin back
I dont understand these niggas gotta adapt
You know where Im at I put the six on the map
Your shorty was bent she wanted to vent
I promise it fell in my lap
My money is young my problems are old
I promise Im bridgin the gap

Woo You know what Im sayin
Woo Ayy ayy
Yeah you know what Im sayin
Gyeah gyeah gyeah gyeah

Niggas provoke this shit aint a joke man nobody playin
Hes at the top and hes at the top but nobody stayin
These niggas around but they aint around
You know what Im sayin
Say that they down when they shit is down
You know what Im sayin

Yeah you know what Im sayin
Ayy ayy yeah
You know what Im sayin

You know what Im sayin
Ayy ayy yeah
You know what Im sayin

Niggas provoke this shit aint a joke man nobody playin
Hes at the top and hes at the top but nobody stayin
These niggas around but they aint around
You know what Im sayin
Say that they down when they shit is down
You know what Im sayin

Yeah you know what Im sayin
Ayy ayy yeah
You know what Im sayin


Dont link me
Dont hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Dont tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you wont love me until Im gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin on
I cant even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin all my heroes like seein how magic works
The people I look up to are goin from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin in the land of the free the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they dont like that its written all on they face
I dont know how Ima make it out of here clean
Cant even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Goodhearted people are takin it to extremes
Leavin me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin me to ask whats their motive in makin peace
Leavin me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin me to ask is there anybody like me

Missin out on my years
Theres times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin out on my days
Scrollin through life and fishin for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
Im tryna see whos there on the other end of the shade
Most times its just somebody thats underaged
Thats probably just alone and afraid
And lashin out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin to give
Cause they been starin at somebody elses version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
Cause all that mattered was impressin everybody shes known
I know another girl thats cryin out for help
But her latest caption is Leave me alone
I know a girl happily married til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places shes flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasnt hidin my kid from the world
I was hidin the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin at your seed you can never relate
Breakin news in my life I dont run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask Why let the story run if its false
You know a wise man once said nothin at all
Im exhausted and drained I cant even pretend
All these people takin miles when you give em an inch
All these followers but who gon follow me to the end
I guess Ill make it to the end and Ima find out then


Ayy wild things youre doin at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doin it all just to feel things
Drinkings enough of a vice
Drugs just arent suiting you right
You were just fine as a real thing thing

I dont know what youre sayin
You you you know

I cant recover from our last conversation
You called me weak
And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other
You wanted me to gon put my hands on you
Just to show you I love you
You know I cant jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you say
Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
Youre actin out you know you love to see me down
Stressin over somethin stressin over somethin

Lowdown dirty shameful crazy

In all the pictures that I seen lately

Thats besides the point Im makin
Youre way too opinionated to have to force it to have to fake it
You had potential I coulda shaped it
You went and caved in Ooh yeah
We coulda waited I wasnt rushin difference in ages
Youre old enough but youre still a baby
Youve shared stories where you did amazin
Things to be loyal things to be patient
That was before me I musta changed it
Shifted your focus lens lookin jaded Jaded

Most of these things I dont wanna say
I wanna be around while you chasin While you chasin it
You wanna hit me up when you make it

Takin shots with the GOAT and talked about shots that we sendin
Ive had scuffles with bad boys that wasnt pretendin
Ive had too many nights to mention thats just the beginnin
Im pretty sure we got a label Im still independent
I fell back a hundred times when I dont get the credit
Seen this movie a hundred times I know where its headed
Realize someone gotta die when no onell dead it
Niggas gamblin with they life for some content
Thats the type of lottery that could get your top picked
I am a creamofthecrop nigga
You niggas pop mollies my Malis pop niggas
House on both coasts but I live on the charts
I have tea with the stars and I swim with the sharks
And I see in the dark wasnt this cold at the start
Think my soul has been marked theres a hole in my heart
Yeah I was about to Man I thought about it
Its unsettlin to talk about it
Free all of my niggas that they caught with it
RIP my niggas that they caught without it
This just the intro let me not get ahead of myself
This is Gods plan young man you said it yourself
Always got a ace up my sleeve for whatever was dealt
Daddy got suits like Bernie Mac he dresses himself
I stopped askin myself and I started feelin myself
Now I gotta deal with all this drama and deal with myself
I aint even have to cut the tie it severed itself
This just the intro let me not get ahead of myself

Way that you lookin all the time
Time gets to tickin and it takes a toll

Things that you couldve kept inside
Sidetrackin me when I was good to you
You were somebody I would stand behind

I know you like to drink til the sun up
Grind til you come up

Workin to try and get you off my mind
