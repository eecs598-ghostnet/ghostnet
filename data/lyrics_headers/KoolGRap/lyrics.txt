you know theres some things in life you just gotta live with man you know what im saying
some choices that we make you just gotta live with you know
some of those choices still haunt me though
let me explain

to my aborted child
how could you not consider yourself a deadbeat
you took care of one child and never fed me
to my aborted child
how could you not consider yourself a loser
its cause of you i aint got no future

i was just a few days shy of my nineteenth birthday when i heard the words youre pregnant
i figured that this meant i needed to decide if i wanted to become a mother not realizing that i already was
i chose abortion because wellmeaning loved ones encouraged it or offered no alternatives
i didnt think that i would be able to finish college
i was ashamed to be pregnant outside of marriage
it was so easy to believe the lies that what would be removed was simply a piece of tissue that by having it removed i could easily go on with my life never looking back


everything anything you know how that shit go
made two moves ive been making for big dough
heroin paradise making the strips snow
young nigga slanging in front of the fish store

i wasnt freshly dipped my gear was straight ripped
im trippin cause my winter coat got lost buttons
and zippers that wouldnt stay zipped
i never remembered a dinner and the brother was straight fat cat
not even a big mac black i had kitkats on top of crackerjacks
walkin the streets with the weak sneaks on my feet
and the freaks wouldnt speak i never had lipstick on my cheek
so much for gettin humped from the stunts i always struck out

collectin street props splittin tops didnt stop so many men dropped
started committin murder after murder
blasted the last nigga that tried to be so fast he flipped him like a burger
slipped and became the victim of his own murder hunger
he got put six feet under by a small shorty that was younger
in this type of street its violence
today happens too often
that hit me hard as hell
to see my dog up in the coffin
people droppin a rose when the casket is closed

so i carried on and wrote this song to keep the strong on
me and black go way back in childhood when we was wild hoods
runnin around the neighborhood and up to no good

then put behind bars sellin drugs and pullin yards
then my crimey got locked up for cookin the rock up
started bouncin uptown to stock up my nigga straight blew the block up
yeah the blue and whites was on sight runnin with flashlights
on the double a fast life thats when he seen his last nights
out on the street runnin from the heat
got knocked and locked up from happy new year
all the way down to trick or treat
the two of those in a wardrobe of clothes
got back on crackin i let him whip the macks and go lookin for hoes
and then another sad story is headed for me
when i found out another soldier died in the territory
so in memory of my dog i write a lyric
straight hopin melodies travel from my mind to your spirit
