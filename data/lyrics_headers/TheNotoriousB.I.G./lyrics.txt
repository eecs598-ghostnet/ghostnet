hi im voletta wallace biggies mom
i wish to thank you for your kind words
you warm gestures and your constant support over the years
i also need to share with you a few words about my son
please take a few moments and listen
i hope you gain something from it thanks

as a child christopher was outspoken
when it suited him at times he was quiet
and of course he was mischievous as all little boys are
as a young man he liked to do everything

he liked to read he liked to be with his friends
as young kids or young boys he enjoyed life
everything that would make him happy or comfortable
he would do but mostly he enjoyed being with his friends and family

his early inspirations toward rap music were
the lls of the world the sugar hills the mr magics
and the fat boys of the rap channel
those were all the things i heard in the house

even though i called it noise and banging
i know now it is a accepted musical art form
i was a single parent i raised my son on my own
his father had no influence on his decision
towards the musical outlet or career he chose

my son had a mind of his own even if his father was around
he would have turned to rap he loved music he loved rap
at a point in my sons life he developed paranoia
about death and about the dying

we are living in a world of imperfect human beings
where greed jealousy and envy
are manifested by what others have accomplished in life
my son was very very much aware of that

he appreciated his station in life on the directions
in which he was going or traveling
on the other hand there were others
who i should use the hip hop phrase player hating

and i think that is what resulted in his paranoia
if i had to change anything in my sons life
that would have allowed him to be here today
i would have deterred him from a career in music

im aware that millions appreciate his music millions loved his music
be that it may if he hadnt chosen that lifestyle that career
my son would be alive today
if i could sum up christopher in one word the word would be generous

the thing that my son loved most about life was the fact that
he was in a position to help position to share
position to give to others who needed to others who wanted
to others appreciated the gifts that he gave

lets say there are many times i looked
and saw reflections of my son
i argued sometimes consulted
i saw results and said well done

i thought of him constantly
and silently asked why
i tried fervently
and just cannot say goodbye

i lived with visions twined and twisted
passion so cold
and withered thoughts battered and shattered
i dreamed dreams
cherished memories
housed friendship
and promises that mattered

in the end
time is treasured
but love for my son
its everlasting


it was me dee the mpv
