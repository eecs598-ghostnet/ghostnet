take me to the river
yeah yeah yeah yeah

its two thousand and two everything was totally new
we were globally huge watchin sales go through the roof
we wrote and we feuded runyon avenue soldiers included
a multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse
we were so bulletproofwrote souped and soaked in our youth
thought we was runnin shit til we lost the sole of our shoe
the death of doody broke us in two
we were thrown for a loop aint none of us know what to do
and at the time i was goin through my own struggles too
so i wasnt in no condition to be coachin us through
everyone tried to go solo really nobody blew
i was hopin they do so i aint have to shoulder the crew
the plan was put everyone in position so that they knew
how to stand on their own and i dont wanna open up wounds
i just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth
cause the truth is the moment that proof died so did the group
shoot

ima wash away my sins
ima rinse away this dirt
i forgot to make amends
to all the friends i may have hurt
i better stop and say my grace
from it i pray that i dont fall
cause on the way back down i may
end up runnin back into them all
i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

it was never the same and its bothered me since
and the farther we drift apart the more awkward it gets
the more time goes by the more life happens
and we gotta be men we got responsibilities
plus we dont say how we feel
and i feel like this is what got us in the debacle were in
been with you guys thick and thin
but its almost as if sometimes were not even friends
which reminded me biz rockstar was the shit
yall coulda got you a hit without me on the shit
if you woulda put dtwelve on it wish i coulda did
more than try talkin you into comin up off of it
i know it wasnt my fault but part of it probably is
i think of all of the trips to bet
and the rappers i wish that we woulda politicked with
maybe yall coulda clicked and got you some features
but thats water under the bridge
but im washin my sins in it til my conscience is cleansed

ima wash away my sins
ima rinse away this dirt
i forgot to make amends
to all the friends i may have hurt
i better stop and say my grace
from it i pray that i dont fall
cause on the way back down i may
end up runnin back into them all
i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones

bacardi and hen never thought the party would end
one minute youre bodyin shit but then your audience splits
you can already sense the climate is startin to shift
to these kids you no longer exist
went from rainin cats and dogs in this bitch
to tiny drops little drips
and by the time your reign is over youll hardly be missed
you start thinkin of all the artists you dissed
all the carnage you left is this the kind of karma you get
for turnin your fuckin back on bizzy kuniva and swift
a freudian slip subconsciously i honestly wished
i aint feel so much guilt and yall didnt harbor resentment
but its hard to pretend that yall aint got none
i just wish i had words but i guess there just are none for this
to my partners i cant say how sorry i am
this is not how i planned for our story to end
i love all of you men
but i just cant be the guy everybody depends
on for entire careers cause thats not even fair
i will always be here but that spark isnt there
and i dont know how to recapture that time and that era
ive tried hearkening back to but im fightin for air
im barely chartin myself
feels like im on the descent but it was not my intent
to treat yall like a stepping stone
though i aint left no one behind but we been down every road
done all we possibly can i know we kept our hopes up
but the longer we spend livin this lie that we live
the less is left for closure so lets let this go
its not goodbye to our friendship but dtwelve is over

ima wash away my sins
ima rinse away this dirt
i forgot to make amends
to all the friends i may have hurt
i better stop and say my grace
from it i pray that i dont fall
cause on the way back down i may
end up runnin back into them all
i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones
i never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones
i never meant to use you all for my stepping stones

then give album of the year to somebody that no ones ever even heard of
all i know is i wrote every single word to
everything i ever murdered
time to separate the sheep from goats yeah
and i got no faith in your writers i dont believe in ghosts
when rap needed it most i was that wing and a prayer
a beacon of hope put a bird in the air
somewhere some kid is bumpin this while he lipsyncs in the mirror
thats who im doin it for the rest i dont really even care
but you would think im carryin an oxford dictionary in my pocket
how im buryin these artists
on a scale of turnt youre minus
mine says very yours says hardly
and whats scary is you probly can compare me to your car cause im just barely gettin started woo
and far as lord jamar you better leave me the hell alone
or ill show you an elvis clone

yo how do i keep

gettin in relationships like this
im just sayin
maybe it says somethin about me
yeah yup
should i look in the mirror

i just want you to be normal
why cant you bitches be normal
always gotta be so extra
why you always need a lecture
my ex hates to talk shes a texter
even when im in bed layin right next to her
wants to get back together
said not til she gets her act together

she thinks im bein mean and now
she starts to scream and shout
shes about to let the demons out
she dont want to see me with other females out
i tell the bitch to beat it take the scenic route
she retaliates by tryin to leave the house
in an evening gown with her cleavage out
weve been down this road too many times for me to count
and all i can think is how

i just want you to be normal
why cant you bitches be normal
always gotta be so extra
like a fuckin terrestrial
guess it comes with the territory
my ex girl she just declared war
therefore i better prepare for it
i guess bein weirds normal

and i dont know whats got a hold of me
most notably ive been zonin to jodeci
im totally open hopelessly devoted
so much so that i bet you she dont even know that shes
the first thing i think of when i wake up
and the last thing i think of fore i go to sleep
sike hope she dont notice me goin through her purse
i know she cheats so do i im soulless shes heartless
no wonder were partners
both got hundreds of charges
domestic disputes but weve always
swept it under the carpet
even when nine hundred and eleven gets the call that
i slipped up and busted her jaw with
a louisville slugger cause alls it
really does is make our love
for each other grow stronger
she won me over the second she tried to run me over
told her id keep it a hun we over
kicked her out called her back now shes coming over
but why is she so wicked
and how the fuck did i get so twisted
up with someone so unlikeable and shifty
were like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with
ignitable liquids but im finally seeing
shes only mine for the time being
thats why i keep bringin up that one time she
tried to twotime me
and throw it up in her face til i dry heave
how could i be so naive
should i leave or turn this entire evening
into a motherfucking crime scene

maybe im just too ugly to compete with him
you werent sposed to agree you fucking bitch
specially when youre the one cheated first
now the argument immediately becomes heated
you dont want me to flip little conceited cunt
eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita
slut treat it just like a drum beat it
complete it and once youve succeeded repeat it
i love you but i hope you fuckin die though
in our business your friends like to pry so
youve got em all under cover just like moles
hopin theyll come back with intel
but im the one whos thrown into the spiral
cause now the roles are reversed so here i go
thinkin im sly as i scroll through your iphone
who the fucks milo
the guy at work who drives a hilo
i put a tracking device on your chrysler
and follow you while you drive home
but like a cyclone i just got my disguise blown
you recognize me and had milo flip me off
right out the passenger side window
i hit a light pole you skrt off
and then pull up at fiveam in the drive in a stretched white limo
stumble in the side door and hit me in the head with milos demo
but like a drunk bum what do i know
lets sleep on it like they did revival
i told you youre the apple of my eye so shut your pie hole

just wanna be normal
why cant you be normal yeah
i just wanna be normal
why cant you be normal


i got a song filled with shit for the strongwilled

i done said a lotta things in my day i admit it
this is payback in a way i regret it that i did it
i done won a couple grammys but i sold my soul to get em
wasnt in it for the trophies just the fuckin recognition
fucks the difference
im that cracker bend the law fuck the rules
man i used to risk it all now i got too much to lose
ive been eatin long enough man my stomach should be full
i just ate licked the plate my buffet lucky me
fuck you think woo

i got a couple of mansions
still i dont have any manners
you got a couple of ghost writers
but to these kids it dont actually matter
theyre askin me what the fuck happened to hiphop
i said i dont have any answers
cause i took an l when i dropped my last album
it hurt me like hell but im back on these rappers
and actually comin from humble beginnings
im somewhat uncomfortable winning
i wish i could say what a wonderful feeling
were on the upswing like were punchin the ceiling
but nothin is feeling like anyone has any fuckin ability
to even stick to a subject its killin me
the inability to pen humility
hatata batata why dont we make a bunch of
fuckin songs about nothin and mumble em
fuck it im goin for the jugular
shit is a circus you clowns that are comin up
dont give an ounce of a motherfuck
about the ones that were here before you that made rap
lets recap way back mcs that wreak havoc on tape decks
adats where the g raps and kanes at
we need three stacks asap and bring masta ace back
cause half of these rappers have brain damage
all the lean rappin face tats syruped out like tree sap
i dont hate trap and i dont wanna seem mad
but in fact where the old me at the same cat
that would take that feedback and aim back i need that
but i think its inevitable
they know what button to press or what lever to pull
to get me to snap though lil bitch
and if i pay it attention im probly makin it bigger
but youve been takin ya digs in the fuckin back ho get it

motherfucker shut the fuck up when im talkin lil bitch
im sorry wait whats your talent oh critiquin

to give a subpar bar or even have an opinion or view
you mention me millions of views attention in news
i mention you loselose for me winwin for you
billions of views your ten cents are two
skim through the music to give shit reviews
to get clicks but bitch you just lit the fuse
dont get misconstrued business as us

or get dissed cause i just dont get
what the fuck half the shit is that youre listenin to
do you have any idea how much i hate this choppy flow
everyone copies though probly no
get this fuckin audio out my audi yo adiós
i can see why people like lil yachty but not me though
not even dissin it just aint for me
all i am simply is just an emcee
maybe stan just isnt your cup of tea get it
maybe your cups full of syrup and lean
maybe i need to stir up shit preferably
shake the world up if it were up to me
paul wants me to chill yall want me to ill
i should eat a pill probably i will
old me killed the new me watch him bleed to death
i breathe on the mirror i dont see my breath
possibly im dead i must be possessed
like an evil spell im evil evil spelled
jam a crest whitestrip in the tip of my dick
with an ice pick stick it in a vise grip
hang it on a spike fence bang it with a pipe wrench
while i take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
like vicepresident mike pence
back up on my shit in a sidekick as i lay it on a spike strip
these are things that id rather do than hear you on a mic
since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
jesus christ man how many times is
someone gonna fuck on my bitch fuck my side chick
you wont ever see em icy
but as cold as i get on the mic
i polarize shit so the temps might freeze
and your skull might split like i bashed you upside it
bitch i got the club on smash like a nightstick yeah
turn down for what
i aint loud enough nah turn the valium up
cause i dont know how im gonna get your mouths to shut
now when it doesnt matter what caliber
i spit at ill bet a hundred thousand bucks
youll turn around and just be like man how the fuck
sourpuss gonna get mad just cause his album sucks
and now he wants to take it out on us ooouuu
but last week an exfan mailed me a copy
of the mathers lp to tell me to study
itll help me get back to myself and shell love me oooouuu
i mailed the bitch back and said if i did that
id just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
especially an effing recovery clone of me nfing
so fingerbang chicken wang mgk igg azae
lil pump lil xan imitate lil wayne
i should aim at everybody in the game pick a name
im fed up with bein humble
and rumor is im hungry im sure you heard bumblings
i heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
i heard your mumblin but its jumbled in mumbojumbo
the era that im from will pummel you thats what its comin to
what the fuck youre gonna do when you run into it
im gonna crumble you and ill take a number two
and dump on you if you aint joyner
if you aint kendrick or cole or sean then youre a goner
im bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
i guess when you walk into bk you expect a whopper
you can order a quarter pounder when you go to mcdonalds
but if youre lookin to get a porterhouse you better go get revival
but yall are actin like i tried to serve you up a slider
maybe the vocals shoulda been autotuned
and you woulda bought it
but sayin i no longer got it
cause you missed a lot and never caught it
cause it went over your head because youre too stupid to get it
cause youre mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest
with your expertise and knowledge but youll never be an artist
and im harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
what ill never be is flawless all ill ever be is honest
even when im gone theyre gonna say i brought it
even when i hit my forties like a fuckin alcoholic
with a bottle full of malt liquor
but i couldnt bottle this shit any longer
the fact that i know that ima hit my bottom
if i dont pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
i dont see why yall even started with me
i get in beefs my enemies die
i dont cease fire til at least all are deceased
im east side never be caught slippin
now you see why i dont sleep not even a wink i dont blink
i dont doze off i dont even nod to the beats
i dont even close my fuckin eyes when i sneeze
aw man that bet cypher was weak it was garbage
the thing aint even orangeoh my god thats a reach
shout to all my colorblind people
each and everyone of yall if you call a fire engine green
aquamarine or you think water is pink

what a way for two thousand and eighteen to get underway
but im gonna say everything that i wanna say
welcome to the slaughterhouse bitch yeah
invite em in like a one a day
im not done preach
cause i feel like the beast of burden
that line in the sand was it even worth it
cause the way i see people turnings
makin it seem worthless its startin to defeat the purpose
im watchin my fan base shrink to thirds
and i was just tryin to do the right thing but word
has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
or still yet to be determined
cause im determined to be me critiqued or worshipped
but if i could go back id at least reword it
and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent
sold the dream to that hes deserted
but i think its workin
these verses are makin him a wee bit nervous
and hes too scurred to answer me with words
cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
but i know at least hes heard it
cause agent orange just sent the secret service
to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin him
or ask if im linked to terrorists
i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists
but my beef is more media journalists
hold up hold up hold up
i said my beef is more meaty a journalist
can get a mouthful of flesh
and yes i mean eating a penis
cause they been pannin my album to death
so i been givin the media fingers
dont wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
but they been puttin me through the ringer

you claim if you get knocked by the cops
youll give em not even a statement
walk in the arraignment
shoot the bailiff karate kick the plaintiff
gotti with the stainless
ill just call it shoddy entertainment
if yall was in the party gettin faded
on molly had the audience sedated
you wouldnt catch a body if it fainted
probably let it fall and hit the pavement
but youd be the first lobbyin to claim it
bitch stop bein a lame
your hobby isnt robbery and dismemberin body limbs
like you was tommy lynn sells
and chainsawin them in the basement
hardly fits your job description
aint nobody dippin
out the back of the club like oh my god hes trippin
only time you get the blade is probably with the dang lawn equipment aint it
wouldnt take a bobby pin and wave it
i need to stop bein debated
youre still copyin xeroxing im still copping a feel
like bill cosby at will popping a pill
then spill oxys in jills coffee
then send her out to the hotel lobby a lil wobbly and still groggy
this blonde fucks reprehensible
misconducts never sensible
kiss my butt my set of principles
is gone but til i get the president to respond
my pen and pencil is a missile launcher
and send it to mitch mcconnell
just as big of a bitch as donaldshits on bruh haha
let me sing this shit soprano
while i do it pizzicato
ivanka stiffarm her while im hittin on melania
and this songs for all ya

cause nobody likes me everybody hates me
they want me to go eat some worms

and drag my name through the mud through the dirt
but ima make you eat your words

you can try to hold me down but you better let me up
cause youre only gonna make things worse
i hope you offended
cause i swear when i get up im never gonna let up
til everybody eats my turds

these drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me

im imagining objects
so im batting cobwebs from a daddy longleg
in hamtramck got the panoramic camera

twice her age and im actin half it haha
grow up nah not that i know of yall
basement just got a frickin overhaul
got a stripper pole installed
started rollin all through those klonopins like a bowlin ball
like an overdose on twice the ratio of propofol
and go through no withdrawal
while i get fellatio and give a facial to
an interracial blowup doll of rachel dolezal
youre so appalled em sos my manager
bitch i am mature fuck a pro career
coast is clear but nowhere to go from here

as the blade i push into caputcha
when i pull em likewhat sleigh rides

ive been making wedding plans all day

cause nobody likes me everybody hates me
they want me to go eat some worms
i hope you offended
and drag my name through the mud through the dirt

im a ten youre an eight
like what i do before after and durin rape
you wanna get into a pissin contest and find out whos better
and be made a fool out of when i pull on em
r kelly with a full bladder
nonhigh school grad im not a scholar
but im so cold when im droppin knowledge
my degrees is the same as i got in college zero
but nobodys hotter you owe me my respect
i owe you nada like haloti partner
blow me told you im so dirty homie
you can throw me in some holy water
with some floaties on and get the soap and try to
get the pope to hold me while you hose me off
and nope i wont be washed
you hope to god i dont explode
i gotta blow this spot up though i got a lotta mo
i wont put the sugar coating on it though
cause sometimes you can feel like your energys expired
raps got you drained dead tired zapped
you feel like a wet pile of crap
but look man like the feds buggin my phone
uhhuh i get why youre tapped
but you gotta get your fire back
catch fire get upset and fire back
is what i tell myself when times get bad
cause sometimes i might get sad
but i take the same advice i had
and tell myself like i used to tell hailie when lifes a drag
told her to do like her dad dont cry get mad
cause little baby powders belong in diaper bags
im hyper by the time you see this side of me
im right in your ass sodomy
foot up it i stood up for the kid
who had to put up with the bullies at his school at his school
you aint had to have no money
or go shoppin just to cop a fuckin attitude attitude
now my doughs amountin to a mountain
thats rised too high to count it
never asked to be rich all i did was wish
i had a dime for every time that i was doubted
but then i think about it then im enraged
cause i just figured out that if i was paid
for the time i spent to put the pen to the page
itd be minimum wage
but its embedded in my head i never
hunted for the bread and butter
what i wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but
im never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood
i put up in the pen and when im dead i wonder
will they put me on a pedestal
or forget i was ever this incredible
i guess i better go harder than ever cause
ill never get another mothafuckin opportunity again
to offend as many people with this i can simply because i can

cause nobody likes me everybody hates me
they want me to go eat some worms
i hope you offended
and drag my name through the mud through the dirt
but ima make you eat your words
i hope you offended
you can try to hold me down but you better let me up
cause youre only gonna make things worse
i hope you offended
cause i swear when i get up im never gonna let up
til everybody eats my turds


some nights i want to run for the hills
its never easy with you
i cannot reason with you
but your smile is as rare as it comes
what would i do without that
maybe thats why i come back
oh what i wouldnt do for you

startin to think we were made for each other
but one of us in this relationship is raisin the other
you remind me of my mother
we drive one another crazy as each other
and were both adults so theres no excuse
for the games that we play with each other
where you at at a friends no you aint mothafucker
but i give her the benefit of the doubt
whenever the doubt kicks in shiver when i touch her
cause i love her so much im a sucker
how her bottom lip can quiver when shes in trouble
shes in hot water think i caught her cheatin again
give her another chance another one after that
im swimmin in that egyptian river cause im in denial
say i dont eat shit but i got a shiteatin grin when i smile
makin an excuse for us to act it out
shes just actin out with her inner child
then i set the truth on fire
cause id rather believe a lie
then i breathe a sigh of relief i dont believe in
goin to bed mad i keep on tryin
to make a bad girl good
but havent i stood by you in good times
and bad im startin to feel like your goddamn dad
cause i literally feel like you could die if ever should i
leave you for good and never would i
itd be all bad never understood why they call it goodbye
but i think im a pretty damn good guy
and youre a good person too
i can save you i can make you change
but i keep puttin my fuckin foot in my mouth
every time i gotta come and bail you out
when you get in trouble that you get yourself in
and im in trouble but i cant leave ill sell you out
i could never turn my fuckin back on youwhat is that
im codependent im just now noticin it
but somehow its like every time im about to go to end it
i aint got the cojones to do it nor the heart
our apartments tore apart
youre usin my heart for a dartboard
but god mustve aligned stars for us
cause somebody paired us up
and they say he aint capable of makin a mistake
but this ones perfect cause im


hes comin home with his neck scratched to catch flack
sweat jackets and dress slacks mismatched
on his breaths jack hes a sex addict
and she just wants to exact revenge and get back
its a chess match shes on his back like a jetpack
shes kept track of all his internet chats
and guess who just happens to be movin on to the next
actually just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
cause she loves danger psychopath
and you dont fuck with no mans girl even i know that
but shes devised some plan to stab him in the back
knife in hand says their relationships hangin by a strand
so shes been on the web lately
says maybe shell be my gwen stacy to spite her man
and i know shes using me to try to play him i dont care
hi suzanne but i shoulda said bye suzanne
after the first night but tonight i am

a onenight stand turned a twonight stand
it was come sunlight scram now we hug tight and
he found out now she feels deserted and used
cause he left so what he did it first to her too
now how am i supposed to tell this girl that were through
its hard to find the words im aloof nervous and sue
dont want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
dont take it personal i just cant say this in person to you
so i revert to the studio like holeinthewall diners
dont have to be reserved in a booth
i just feel like the person who im turning intos
irreversible i preyed on you like its church at the pew
and now that i got you i dont want you
took advantage in my thirst to pursue
why do i do this dirt that i do
get on my soapbox and preach my sermon and speech
detergent and bleach is burnin the wound
cause now with her in the womb
we cant bring her in this world shoulda knew
to use protection fore i bit into your forbidden fruit
fuck

my names ooh my names ooh
river ooh river run
call me ooh call me ooh
river ooh well let the river run

always the bridesmaid never the bride hey
fuck can i say if life was a highway
and deceit was an enclave id be swerving in five lanes
speeds at a high rate like im slidin on ice maybe
thats why i may have came at you sideways
i cant keep my lies straight
but i made you terminate my baby
this love triangle left us in a wreck tangled
what else can i say it was fun for a while
bet i really woulda loved your smile
didnt really wanna abort but fuck it
whats one more lie to tell our unborn child

ive been a liar been a thief
been a lover been a cheat
all my sins need holy water feel it washing over me
well little one im sorry
i dont want to admit to something i fucked up
if all its gonna cause is pain
the truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
so let the river run


all my life i was told i was never nothing special
i dont need to be reminded of it every other second
specially when all my selfesteems
already shot to hell im falling helplessly
im embarrased i dont want no one else to see
cause i feel like im a piece of shit every time she yells at me
selfishly addicted definitely doesnt help that she
makes me feel like ive died and gone to heaven
but makes life a living hell for me
she does that thing with her lip now shes melting me
im putty in her palms im wrapped around her finger
a yoyo on a string she lets me sit there and just dangle
until something better comes along
and shell just drop me like a hot potato
i look like im in pain but im okay though
cause i know she loves memy friends what do they know

in my moments of weakness
i openly admit the shit i wouldnt normally
im extremely selfconscious and enormously
insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
it only turns to ammunition for her in this war when she
gets goin she dont stop when im up shes like a downer
when i found her it was love at first encounter
but somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter
cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for
me to walk on when im around her
but theres just something about her
that makes me not able to function without her
how can i get out of it when i dont know how to
im a doubter im a pessimist make a believer out of me
and show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
cause im going straight down the drain im drowning

it took a while for me to get it but i think ive figured it out
she dont want me she just dont wanna see me with someone else
the idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself
to see me falling to pieces brings her joy and brings her health
but it annoys her to see me get the strength to say screw her
i threw up on myself im dumb sick im addicted to her
shes tryna block the door so heres how i do her
since im manure shes a sewer
and this time this piece of shits running through her
i can see the light now im running to it
what the fuck shoulda knew it
who would think shed actually have the balls to do it
as soon as i hopped in it she doused the car with lighter fluid
shes standing there with a rag bout to put the lighter to it
lit the fucking thing on fire then she threw it


pt i

hands up officer dont shoot
then pull your pants up promise you wont loot
we may never understand each other its no use
we aint ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

black boy black boy we aint gonna lie to you
black boy black boy we dont like the sight of you
pull up on the side of you
window rolled down profile
then we wonder why we see this side of you
probably comin from the dope house
we could let you slide but your tail light is blew out
we know youre hidin that heidi klum
on you another drug charge homie its back inside for you
and just in case a chase might ensue we got that tried and true
pistol drew right at you wed be delighted to unload it
in your back then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
fucked up but what the fuck am i to do
i keep tellin myself keep doin like youre doin
no matter how many lives you ruin
its for the red white and blue
time to go find a new one and split his head right in two
no ones ever indicted you
why cause youre a

white boy white boy youre a rockstar
my momma talkin to me tryna tell me how to live
white boy white boy in your cop car
but i dont listen to her cause my head is like a sieve
white boy white boy youre untouchable
the worlds coming to an end i dont even care
nobody can tell me shit cause im a big rockstar

black boy black boy we dont get your culture and
we dont care what our governments done to fuck you over man
dont tell us your attitudes a result of that
balderdash whered you get the chip on your shoulder at
why you kicking that soda can
pull your pants up we bout to roll up and
throw your ass in the van cuffed
you dont have to know our plans or what our intentions are
our cards are close to our chest you better show your hands
and put our minds more at ease
or get shot in the thyroid comply or die boy
were fightin a crime war here come the swine
tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
thats what we call em pigsties for
theyre like eyesores to police
talk to you like just a piece of trash
feels like were stuck in a time warp to me
as i kick these facts and get these mixed reactions
as this beat backspins its like were drifting back in
to the sixties having black skin is risky
cause this keeps happening
throughout history africanamericans have been treated like shit
and i admit there have been times where its been embarrassin to be a

white boy white boy youre a rockstar
my momma talkin to me tryna tell me how to live
white boy white boy in your cop car
but i dont listen to her cause my head is like a sieve
white boy white boy youre untouchable
the worlds coming to an end i dont even care
nobody can tell me shit cause im a big rockstar

pt ii

seems like the average lifespan of a white man
is more than twice than a black life span
i wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
i feel like checking out on life cant escape this circumstance
id rather hear em say die nword than die antwoord
ninja now its better disguised banter
but thats life strapped cause were strapped financially
and cant find answers
were applying but mcdonalds
seems to be the only franchise thatll hire
so how can we have higher standards
as dallas overshadows the battle for black lives matter
we fight back with violence but acts like that are
black eyes on the movement
which makes black lives madder
at cops and cops madder
thats why its at a stalemate
and cant arrive at a compromise so its black ops
i wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops
the block is our backyards officers not the crack spot
call the attack dogs off of us man
you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
and bad cops fuck it up for the good cops and man stop
sendin white cops in the black neighborhoods
who aint acclimated to em like thats the way to do it
who seen some fuckin videos of rappers waving guns
and know nobody black so they act afraid of us
and thats racism the fear that a black face gives em
a subconscious racist
wait why are there black neighborhoods
cause america segregated us designated us to an area
separated us sectioneightd us
when we tear it ups the only time attentions paid to us
and education sucks and every days another
freddie gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz
why is it they treat us like dryer lint
we just want a safe environment for our kids
but cant escape the sirens
dont take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
the poverty that we face so the crime rates the highest in
the lowest classes its like a razor wire fence
and were trapped in these racial biases
that plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
every time we see a devils face
lions tigers and bears oh my
its more like billy clubs and gats
and we really love it when you think were guilty cause were black
but you kill each other facts
you peel each others caps for silly stuff like hats
single mother strugglin through substance abuse
while people with nothin to lose shoot each other for shoes
fuck your republican views
pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots
and streets act as a narrator dont gotta read comics
or be that into characters just to see that just to be black
you better be strapped with a derringer
or be capped in america like steve rogers
cause no one oversees these cops and
all we see is em beat charges
we done seen em beat rodney king unconscious and got off
so we dont need all you crooked police officers peace offerings
just keep marchin til we reach congress
but theyre gonna say youre tryin to take an irrational stance
if you try to slander the flag but
somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
so they call it a kaepernick tantrum
if you dont stand for the national anthem
we raise it you better praise it
or youll be made to feel like a traitor well
treat you like rodney dangerfield
home of the brave is still racist ville
so this whole nation feels like a plantation field
in a country that claims that its foundation was based on united states ideals
that had its natives killed
got you singin this starspangled spiel
to a piece of cloth that represents the land of the free that made people slaves to build


i built this castle

im getting sick of chasing this illusion ha
sorry for sloppy writing
the pen in my hand is shaking please excuse me
dads a little nervous but at the same time excited
if i use this same energy while im saying rhymes and write them
with the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm
as im using in this letter maybe they can feel me as im
trying to build these castles out of sand baby girl
for you to sit on the throne i got plans baby girl
welcome to mom and dads crazy world
love daddy mapleflavored kisses buttered pancakes and syrup

i built this castle

to do whatever to do whatever
december onest one thousand nine hundred and ninetysix dear hailie

her beautiful smile but your ears are the same size as mine are
sorry for that a little minor mishap
but youll grow into them baby im on the grind now
im doing little shows open mics allnighters at studios
while im tryna keep the lights on
why does it seem like im so close to this dream yet so far
i just keep steering ima turn into someone
i havent the slightest clue what ima do if it falls through
you took your first steps today youll probably walk soon
my infinite cd flopped too many soft tunes
theyre talking bad about dad its ticking me off too
makes me feel like i dont belong or something ooh
i think i might have just stumbled onto something new
got a prediction for the future im hoping that you
open this envelope when youre older and it holds true

i built this castle
now we are trapped on the throne
im sorry were alone
i wrote my chapter
youll turn the page when im gone
i hope youll sing along
this is your song
i just want you to know that i aint scared
whatever it takes to raise you im prepared
to do whatever to do whatever
december twentyfourth two thousand and seven dear hailie

now if you found these letters i guess i better try to explain
a lots happened in between them since i rised to this fame
ive said your name but always tried to hide your face
this game is crazy i wanted to claim my love for you but dang
i never knew itd be like this if i did i wouldnt have done it
you aint asked for none of this shit now youre being punished
things that shouldve been private with me and your mother is public
i cant stomach they can take this fame back i dont want it
ill put out this last album then im done with it
onehundred percent finished
fed up with it im hanging it up fuck it
excuse the cursing baby but just know
that im a good person though they portray me as cold
and if things should worsen dont take this letter i wrote
as a goodbye note but your dads at the end of his rope
im sliding down a slippery slope
anyways sweetie i better go
im getting sleepy love dad shit i dont know


i walk on water
but i aint no jesus
i walk on water
but only when it freezes fuck

why are expectations so high is it the bar i set
my arms i stretch but i cant reach
a far cry from it or its in my grasp but as
soon as i grab squeeze
i lose my grip like the flying trapeze
into the dark i plummet now the skys blackening
i know the marks high butter
flies rip apart my stomach
knowin that no matter what bars i come with
youre gonna harp gripe and
thats a hard vicodin to swallow so i scrap these
as pressure increases like khakis
i feel the ice cracking because

i walk on water
but i aint no jesus
its the curse of the its the curse of the
i walk on water shit
but only when it freezes

its the curse of the standard
that the first of the mathers disc set
always in search of the verse that i havent spit yet
will this step just be another misstep
to tarnish whatever the legacy love or respect
ive garnered the rhyme has to be perfect the delivery flawless
and it always feels like im hittin the mark
til i go sit in the car listen and pick it apart
like this shit is garbage
gods given me all this still i feel no different regardless
kids look to me as a god this is retarded
if only they knew its a facade and its exhaustive
and i try not to listen to nonsense
but if you bitches are tryin to strip me of my confidence
mission accomplished
im not godsent nas rakim pac big james todd smith
and im not prince so

i walk on water
but i aint no jesus
i walk on water
its true im a rubiks its true
but only when it freezes
its true

its true im a rubiksa beautiful mess
at times juvenile yes i goof and i jest
a flawed human i guess
but im doin my best to not ruin your ex
pectations and meet em but first
the speedom verse now big sean
hes goin too fast is he gonna shout or curse out his mom
there was a time i had the world by the balls eatin out my palm
every album song i was spazzin the fuck out on
and now im gettin clowned and frowned on
but the only one whos looking down on
me that matters nows deshaun
am i lucky to be around this long
begs the question though
especially after the methadone
as yesterday fades and the dresden home
is burnt to the ground and all thats left of my house is lawn
the crowds are gone
and its time to wash out the blonde
sales decline the curtains drawn
theyre closin the set im still pokin my head from out behind
and everyone who has doubt remind
now take your best rhyme outdo it now do it a thousand times
now let em tell ya the world no longer cares
or gives a fuck about your rhymes
and as i grow outta site outta mind i might go outta mine
cause how do i ever let this mic go without a fight
when i made a fuckin tightrope outta twine
but when i do fall from these heights though ill be fine
i wont pout or cry or spiral down or whine
but ill decide if its my final bow this time around cause

cause im just a man
but as long as i got a mic im godlike
so me and you are not alike
bitch i wrote stan


and i started from the bottom
like a snowmangroundup
like round chuck and still put hands on you
stayin wound up is how i spend time get it
sucker free confidence high
such a breeze when i pen rhymes
i just got that air about me like wind chimes yeah
nother day in the life uh
used to have to scrape to get by yeah
now my communitys gated and i
made it and my neighbors say hi say hi
im givin em pounds im upscale now
guess it means im way in the sky way in the sky
but i still remember the days of
minimum wage for general labor
welfare recipient since a minor
look how government assistance has made ya
adversity if at first you dont succeed
put your temper to more use
cause bein brokes a poor excuse
that should only give you more fuel
show em why youre you
so close god its like i almost got it
but close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes
so i unabomb shittick tick tickno remorse pew
screw it im lit and that attitude i blew up on quick
thats why they call me firecracker
i grew up on wicwick wick wickwith a short fuse
i got some important news to report to
anyone who thought i was done nah bitch not quite
spotlights back on got my faith wheres yours

do you still believe in me
didnt i give everything i had to give you to make you see
ill never forget if you turn your back on me now
and walk out i will never let you live it down
ill never quit do you still believe in me

man i know sometimes
these thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
to me theyre just ink blots
i just fling em like slingshots and so precise
so you might wanna think it over twice yeah
or you retards can roll the dice
but beef will at least cost you your career
cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
but this middle fingers free as a bird
nuke warhead at birth hugest forehead on earth
too short for the verse studied his formula learned
how to incorporate a curse
point it towards corporate america
stick a fork in and turn
cause fourletter words are more better heard
the world forcefed a turd to me youre getting yours
but sometimes i overdo it but i just get so into it
i was there consolin you when no one knew it
when your situation showed no improvement
i was that door you walked over to it
im the light at the end of the tunnel
so people are always lookin to me as theyre goin through it
when that tunnel vision is unclear
shit becomes too much to bear
since cleanin out my closet
when i was havin trouble with the snare
im that unrealistic prayer answered
and ima get you jacked up like youre tryna fix a flat uh
when you struggle with despair
that doublefisted bareknuckles coupled with this pair
of nuts im cuppin i am your fuck it switch nothin can compare

do you still believe in me
didnt i give everything i had to give you to make you see
ill never forget if you turn your back on me now
and walk out i will never let you live it down
ill never quit do you still believe in me

started from the bottom like a snowman
oh man put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
but my batterys low ima need a boost to my pack
and i know that i always got proof at my back
i called you proof because i knew for a fact
my ace in the hole homie im callin on you
cause i think im slowly startin to lose faith in it so
give me that inkling and mo
tivation to go hussein with the flow
fake fans that are twofaced didnt show
let heartbeats loop produce hate in my soul
layin vocals two days in a row
true statement hate to go down this road
but theres only one route to cross this bridge
so i walk in this bitch with loose change
cause all my dues paid but this booths takin its toll
but its never too late to start a new beginnin
that goes for you too so what the fuck you gon do
use the tools youre given
or youre gon use the cards youre dealt
as an excuse for you to not do shit with em
i used to play the loservictim
til i saw the way proof was driven
i found my vehicle and i havent ran out of gas yet
and when they stacked decks turn handicaps into assets
fanny packs hourglasses
if time was on my side id still have none to waste
man in my younger days
that dream was so much fun to chase
its like id run in place
while this shit dangled in front of my face
but how do you keep up the pace
and the hunger pangs once youve won the race
when that dual exhaust is coolin off
cause you dont got nothin left to prove at all
cause you done already hit em with the coup de grâce
still you feel the need to go full tilt
that bruce willis that blue steel that true skill
when that wheels loose i wont lose will
do you still believe


i feel sorry for this beat sympathy pains for this track
this road is takin me back
down memory lane with this rap
i can still look out in this crowd be wowed and be taken aback
im simply stating a fact
i had wembley stadium packed
but now were on a path headed to nowhere and fast
another terrorist attacks
like a tariff blows half of madison square up alas
we perish in the blast
but that isnt scaring us we pass
nowhere were fearless cause were just

ashes blowin in the air
our worlds on fire but we dont care yeah
we dont give ano no
wasted youth always on the road
never lookin back and were never gettin old
cause the skies are black
but our hearts made of gold golden
fuck doin what youre told what were told
were goin nowhere fast

fuck doin what youre told act like a twoyear old
shit is soon to go kaboom and blow
anyways for mcs its a funeral
when im devisin this rhyme
cause im awake and youre mourning
thats why i rise and i shine
like a new day has dawned on me
gusto guts bravado
nuts and plus i kick up dust and cuss a lot
i musta got you in somewhat of a debacle
cause some stuff thats awful
really dont mean nothin although
theres a lot of shit i said in jest thats tough to swallow
but if at times my heart it seems
like its in the wrong place its probably cause its on my sleeve
keanu reeves speed of life avoid or veer
or just steer toward it were only lookin forward
but where were goin we have no idea
nowhere to go but hysterical its gettin warm in here
i set the world on fire was born to be an arsonist
just one spark and its lit
but ima still get dark on this shit
told you id leave my mark on this bitchwar machine
but you forced me in a corner
im sure to have somethin for your rear
and in the course of the assault as torture gets more severe
go to war with me youll end up blew to timbuktu
i send at you a tenton nuke like kim jongun
and end up ruinin your career
but when all is said and done
and at the end of my run ill just rewind clocks forever young
make time stop will i ever fall off that day will never come
til the pine box bitch fuck you im better than i ever was
til the bomb drops hope it never does
but im not gonna sweat it cause
this worlds screwed its already fucked
and im on top so everyones just

ashes blowin in the air so were
our worlds on fire but we dont care yeah
we dont give ano no
wasted youth always on the road
never lookin back and were never gettin old
cause the skies are black
but our hearts made of gold golden
fuck doin what youre told what were told
were goin nowhere fast

you cant tell us nothin
hardheaded and were stubborn
so one ear and out the other when were young were young
were on the run of our lives
who knows what the future for us could hold
another shooter uh oh
were on the run of our lives
no more tomorrows were done
and all we are is

ashes blowin in the air so were
our worlds on fire but we dont care dont care yeah
we dont give ano no
wasted youth always on the road
never lookin back and were never gettin old
cause the skies are black
but our hearts made of gold golden
fuck doin what youre told what were told
were goin nowhere fast


im packin up my shit as much shit in the car as i can fit
and im just drivin as far as i can get
away from these problems til all of my sorrows i forget
whats tomorrow like cause tonight im startin life again
get to the corner and stop fuck am i goin
besides psycho when i fantasize startin my whole life over
yeah right oh and i might go and
get hypnotized so i dont even recognize no one
i try to look alive but theres nothin like holdin
your head up high when youre dead inside and i just hide so in
case youre wonderin why are my insides showin
cause i done spilled all my guts and those are mine so im
pickin em up and stuffin em back
fuck it ive done enough in this rap shit
recovery brought me nothin but back
to right where i was and perhaps
this coulda been my victory lap if i wasnt on the verge of relapse

it seems to be the reoccurring main theme
the shit i would daydream as a kid i was eighteen
i went from an irate teenager to still raging
as an adult amazing back then i put anything
into the rhyme whether it was sad mad happy or angry
i spit it the mainstream i hit it
yay me i did it did what
hailie baby i didnt mean to make you eighty
percent of what i rapped about
maybe i shoulda did a better job at separating
shady and entertaining from real life
but this fame thing is still the hardest thing to explain
its the craziest shit i
ever seen and back then it was like i aint even
bothered taking into consideration
you one day being older and may hear me say things
i didnt a mean and b just aint me
okay so ladies and gentlemen
lets strip away everything and see the main reason that i
feel like a lame piece of shit i sound cranky and bitter
complain beef and bicker bout the same things
cause when i look at me i dont see what they see
i feel ashamed greedy
and lately ive been contemplating
escaping to get away and go wherever this road takes me
its making me crazy whats in my


feeling kinky lip syncing to too horts freaky tales biatch
having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
and envisioning sneaking into where christie brinkley dwells
i know this is risky thinking but i wanna stick her like shes decals
but when murdering females
better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed
better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail
if you get scratched because your dnall
be all up under her fingernails
man he hears you i dont think he cares
he gives a fuck even his pinky swears
three personalities burstin out of me please beware
her tv blares cant hear the creaking stairs
shes unaware in no underwear shes completely bare
turns around and screams i remember distinctly
i said im here to do sink repairs
chop her up put her body parts
in front of steven averys trailer and leave em there

but hey man i was framed
i know what this looks like officers
please just give me one minute
i think i can explain
i aint murdered nobody
i know these words are so nutty
but im just here to entertain
how come your shirt is so bloody
theres a missing person so what hes
got nothin to do with me
im almost certain i was framed

woke up it was dawn musta knew somethin was wrong
think im becomin a monster cause of the drugs that im on
donald ducks on theres a tonka truck in the yard
but dog how the fuck is ivanka trump in the trunk of my car
gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
must go above and beyond cause its incumbent upon me
plus i feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde
girl that motherfuckin baton twirler that got dumped in the pond
second murder with no recollection of it
collectin newspaper articles cuttin out sections from it
memorys too fucked to remember destructive temper
cut my public defenders jugular then stuck him up in a blender
another dismembered toddler discovered this winter probably
cause the disassembled body
was covered up in the snow since the month of november oddly
im wanted for questioning
them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me

but hey man i was framed
i know what this looks like officers
please just give me one minute
i think i can explain
i aint murdered nobody
i know these words are so nutty
but im just here to entertain
how come your shirt is so bloody
theres a missing person so what hes
got nothin to do with me
im almost certain i was framed

still on the loose they
spotted me inside mcdonalds tuesday
in a toronto blue jays cap lookin like your college roommate
with rihanna lupe saddam hussein bobby boucher
or was it cool j the cops is on a goose chase
just escaped from the state pen
for edited eight women who hate men
dont make it no weirder im naked
when i break in your basement
under your babys play pen i lay in wait adjacent
facin the door remainin patient while stayin complacent
blatant sexual implications are continuin to get thrown
insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
left on your pillow in hopes that when you get home
youll get the hint ho im in your window
but it never occurred to me i could describe a murder scene
in a verse and be charged with first degree
cause it just happened to match up perfectly
with the massacre or the burger king burglary
no officer you see 

i was framed
i know what this looks like officers
please just give me one minute
i think i can explain
i aint murdered nobody
i know these words are so nutty
but im just here to entertain
how come your shirt is so bloody
theres a missing person so what hes
got nothin to do with me
im almost certain i was framed


yo i bust in devilish grin disgustin
asshole freckled cheeks and a buttchin

but you must be tokin if you think youre takin over my quarters
there goes the dime into the jukebox
two shots of blue hpnotiq and soon ill
turn this pool hall to a barroom brawl
so rick scratch on the break like the cue ball
turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
and excuse the locker room talk im just too raw

this rap shit got me travelin place to place
you barely leave your house
cause youre always stuck at your pad its stationary
yeah thats why when i brainstorm gotta write it out
simon cowell of rhymin foul thats why you sound so shook
wire bound notebook got tied around your throat
hook it inside your mouth gohruh

cause im tearin at your flesh with it
til your larynx and neck are split
with these lyrics weapons expert with
like hair extensions extra clips
and youre scared to effin death of it
bitch youre starin at a legend that
in a pair of skechers sweatshirt ripped
and hoodie black should be strapped
to a chair or stretcher electric swear on every record bitch

like a barometric pressure switch
carin less who i offend with this
im at your neck like pez dispense
go head spit your flow bitch

and ill take a hundred of you hundred of you
all at once like i had nothin to lose what can i do
my appetite for destruction is loose destruction is loose
and all it wants is to have somethin to chew
somethin to chew somethin to chew

yeah uh haha and still conjoined at
the hip with hop still on point and poignant
skilled as floyd is
in this field and still no filter boy
ill put you in your place yeah like a realtor boy
you still aint in the buildin boy
i will destroy shit even as i build it
get the drill bit pen is filled with poison
which is the source easy to still pinpoint it
like what like a real thin joint it
what comes on quilted northern
and what in a builtin toilet
yeah bitch i told you im a dog woof
i wouldnt heal with ointment
way im kickin these fairies tails
should write a childrens storybook yeah yeah yeah
million voices in my head
but still get a little bit of thrill and some real enjoyment
off what off the feel of going in
like like your bitch when she gives me brain
like she thinks im dumb
grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come
til i feel anointed
she makes iller noises
when shes with me must be from the windy city
pretty apparent shes a milf when blowin me
cause i conned her into
rippin the condom in two woo
dick is a bargainin tool
now im gettin blew like klonopins rude jude
i go there you wouldnt
well i still have a few views in common with you

youre a hasbeen
that has been the case since back when
you last went and threw your hat in the race
youve been trash bitch

or end up in my next rhyme
youre a fuckboy so next time
its gonna be heads flyin like dez bryant
with a tecnine against rex ryan yeah
now watch me set it like correct time
all you get is sloppy seconds like a timex i
clock rejects into the next life
talking reckless but its just my
strongest suit but you can get my colombian necktie
prostitute just climb in the humvee and lets ride
why you hitching at night
i put an end to your life sex crime
kidding aside insidious vibe
girl you know you got the prettiest eyes
but all youre getting is bribed
any old lie to try to get you inside
then we gon end up spending the night
and im skinning your hide like an indian tribe
what kind of nut drives a budweiser truck
finds a slut tries to surprise her cuffs ties her up
binds up cuts slices her twice
but the muff diver must just like it rough
fuck right in her vagina blood
flies up on the visor like a geyser uh
music please enthusiast of the roofie
goal is to get a floozy inside the jacuzzi
and have a looseygoosey as cool c is with an uzi
but i am to rap what blue jeans mean to bruce springsteen
glued we be im trutv youre too pg
im schoolly d youre spoonie gee
no diss there just notice there
are no similarities that we share
besides the fact we breathe air
happily married to rap and im glad that we buried
the hatchet and patched it up
now im back to ratchet up my attack
and im at your mothafuckin throat like

and ill take a hundred of you hundred of you
all at once like i had nothin to lose what can i do
my appetite for destruction is loose destruction is loose
and all it wants is to have somethin to chew
somethin to chew somethin to chew


yeah shout to everybody
whos been on this trip with me
you dont have to agree
but if you feel like me

someone get this aryan a sheet
time to bury him so tell him to prepare to get impeached
everybody on your feet
this is where terrorism and heroism meet square off in the street
this chump barely even sleeps
all he does is watch fox news like a parrot and repeats
while he looks like a canary with a beak
why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet hes tryin to divide us
this shits like a cult but like johnny hell only unite us
cause nothin inside us drives us like this fight does
similar to when two cars collide cause
our spirits crushed and this spots a tight one
but here the jaws of life come
to pull us from the wreckage thats what we get pride from
when we cant from our stars and stripes cause
this type of pickle that were in is hard to deal
but theres always tomorrow still
if we start from scratch like a scab get the scars to heal
and band together for charlottesville
and for heather fallen heroes fill this wall with murals
nevada get up hit the damn resetter
lets start from zero this is our renewal
spray tan get rid of get a brand new better
america and heres to where it all

and heres to where we all began all began stand up
heres to the land that made me
and made me who i am who i am hands up
heres to the land that raised me
this one for the only place that really knows me
for the cracks in the road that drove me
theres no place like home

didnt wanna piss your base off did ya
cant denounce the klan cause they play golf with ya
you stay on twitter way to get your hate off
nazi i do not see a way yall differ
and all you got are race cards bigot
the swastika with your name carved in it
should be your trademark cause hates all you played off
and you just lick the plate off
so i guess it pays to feed off of chaos
so basically you ate off hitler
but you aint ruinin our country punk
or takin our pride from us you wont define us
cause like a dictionary things are lookin up
so much got a sprained neck know we would rise up
against this train wreck and take a stand
even if it means sittin when they raise the flag
to sing the starspangled banner
this man just praised a statue of general lee
cause he generally hates the black people degrades hispanics
take it back to the shady national convention
wish i woulda spit on it before i went to shake his hand
at the event or maybe had the wherewithal
to know that he was gonna try to tear apart
our sacred land we cherish and stand for
so hands in the air lets hear it for
the start of a brand new america
without him and be proud of where were from
and heres to where we all

and heres to where we all began all began stand up
heres to the land that made me
and made me who i am who i am hands up
heres to the land that raised me
this one for the only place that really knows me
for the cracks in the road that drove me
theres no place like home

i wont give up
i wont give up on my home that so many died for
you already know that i wont give up
i wont give up on my home that so many died for
you already know
theres no place like home no place like home
wherever i go no place like home
no place like home no place like home
wherever i go yeah

and heres to where we all began all began stand up
heres to the land that made me
and made me who i am who i am hands up
heres to the land that raised me
this one for the only place that really knows me
for the cracks in the road that drove me
theres no place like home


we never saw from each others sides or eye to eye
just eye for eye lie for lie fight or flight
so much baggage need a luggage rack
but we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
up back in the news love taps when i dissed you
like it was fun actually used to run back to the booth
jump back in the studio give you a tonguelashing then you
laughed at the stomach tat with the tombstone
it was funny back in our youth
but then it wasnt after we knew
that we were done and actually through and actually through
but if theres one fraction of truth
if it could be spun back i would do
so many things different things different
cause it was such a dumbass excuse
you hit me once and that i would use
to continue the pattern of abuse
why did i punch back girls your dad is a scumbag im confused
because

you were the beat i loved with a writers block
the line thats hot that i forgot
we laughed a little cried a lot
ill never forget when you came home and you held hailie
day before you went to jail and daily
how wed wait for that mail lady
or by the phone for mom to call
and i watched you pull yourself up and we decided on
givin it one more try despite it all
youre my lightning rod when my sky gets dark
im your shiny rocks in that tiny box
when we tied the knot when we broke the knot
every line we crossed we were supposed to not
every time we fought the insults they got thrown too far
words that we said that we didnt mean
the words that we meant that we didnt say
the ones that we thought that we shoulda said
letters written that we coulda read
which maybe woulda lead to some good instead
and had this put to bed
but id be lyin still if i said i wasnt sittin here askin myself

how come you can be a lord and a loser
how come how come you can be a liar and a good father
a good dad but a bad husband
why are you a good father
a great dad but a bad husband dad you said
forever be a hero in my eyes i reply
but theres always another side to a good father
a great dad but a bad husband

we brought out the worst in each other
someone had to make the sparring end
cause i loved you but i hated that me
and i dont wanna see that side again
but im sorry kim
more than you could ever comprehend
leavin you was fuckin harder than
sawing off a fuckin body limb
once upon a time were all we had
maybe thats what drew us
to each other it was true love
shit we never knew was possible
we might have loved each other too much
and maybe thats what made us do what
we did to each other all the screwups
cause you always thought that you was
more in love with me
and i was thinkin i was more in love than you was
for all the times that we thought it worked
til we saw how wrong we were
when the dust settles now and all the dirt
if i touch the rawest nerve
all i want is for us not to hurt
and its been an exhaustive search to find the words
but i just heard mockingbird
and got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
the purpose was not to stir up or open wounds
ive caused a few and so have you
or argue whose fault it was
partly yours partly mine but really no ones
this is so tough im gettin choked up
oh fuck it we both suck
we broke up got back together
we both thought we had forever
not bad people just bad together
we were so nuts backstabbed each other
another blow struck but theres no duckin this blow
cause its over and its closure
but im not so sure how to close this
i just dont know how some people can be so good
at one thing and so fucked at a whole nother
shit its no wonder

how come how come you can be a lord and a loser
how come how come you can be a liar and a good father
a good dad but a bad husband
why are you a good father
a great dad but a bad husband dad you said
forever be a hero in my eyes i reply
but theres always another side to a good father
a great dad but a bad husband

yeah haha whoo shit
aight guess what i aint coming in yet
ill come in a minute
ayo this is my love song it goes like this

back when mark wahlberg was marky mark fuckin faggot
this is how we used to make the party start
we used to mix hen with bacardi dark
and when it kicks in you can hardly talk
and by the sixth gin youre gon probably crawl
and youll be sick then and youll probably barf
and my prediction is youre gon probably fall
either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
and everythings spinnin youre beginnin to think women
are swimmin in pink linen again in the sink then in
a couple of minutes that bottle of guinness is finished
you are now allowed to officially slap bitches
you have the right to remain violent and start wilin
start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyein you
get in your car start it and start drivin
over the island and cause a fortytwocar pileup
earth calling pilot to copilot
looking for life on this planet sir no sign of it
all i can see is a bunch of smoke flyin
and im so high that i might die if i go by it
let me outta this place im outta place
im in outer space ive just vanished without a trace
im going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
ill be back in an hour or so

cause every time i go to try to leave
something keeps pullin on my sleeve
i dont wanna but i gotta stay
these drugs really got a hold of me
cause every time i try to tell em no
they wont let me ever let em go
im a sucker all i gotta say
these drugs really got a hold of me

in third grade all i used to do
was sniff glue through a tube and play rubiks cube
seventeen years later im as rude as jude
schemin on the first chick with the hugest boobs
ive got no game and every face looks the same
theyve got no name so i dont need game to play
i just say whatever i want to whoever i want
whenever i want wherever i want however i want
however i do show some respect to few
this ecstasys got me standin next to you
getting sentimental as fuck spillin guts to you
we just met but i think im in love with you
but youre on it too so you tell me you love me too
wake up in the morning like yo what the fuck we do
i gotta go bitch you know i got stuff to do
cause if i get caught cheatin then im stuck with you
but in the long run these drugs are probably going
to catch up sooner or later but fuck it im on one
so lets enjoy let the x destroy your spinal cord
so its not a straight line no more
til we walk around looking like some windup dolls
shits stickin out of our backs like a dinosaur
shit six hits wont even get me high no more
so bye for now im going to try to find some more

cause every time i go to try to leave
something keeps pullin on my sleeve
i dont wanna but i gotta stay
these drugs really got a hold of me
cause every time i try to tell em no
they wont let me ever let em go
im a sucker all i gotta say
these drugs really got a hold of me

thats the sound of a bottle when its hollow
when you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
and tomorrow youre probably gonna wanna do it again
whats a little spinal fluid between you and a friend
screw it and whats a little bit of alcohol poisonin
and whats a little fight tomorrow youll be boys again
its your life live it however you wanna
marajuonna is everywhere where was you brought up
it dont matter as long as you get where youre goin
cause none of this shits gonna mean shit where were goin
they tell you to stop but you just sit there ignorin
even though you wake up feeling like shit every mornin
but youre young youve got a lot of drugs to do
girls to screw parties to crash sucks to be you
if i could take it all back now i wouldnt
i would have did more shit that people said that i shouldnt
but im all grown up now and upgraded
and graduated to better drugs and updated
but i still got a lotta growing up to do
i still got a whole lotta throwing up to spew
but when its all said and done ill be forty
before i know it with a forty on the porch tellin stories
with a bottle of jack two grandkids in my lap
babysitting for hailie while hailies out getting smashed

cause every time i go to try to leave
something keeps pullin on my sleeve
i dont wanna but i gotta stay
these drugs really got a hold of me
cause every time i try to tell em no
they wont let me ever let em go
im a sucker all i gotta say
these drugs really got a hold of me

remember me remember me

feels like a close its coming to
fuck am i gonna do
its too late to start over
this is the only thing i thing i know

sometimes i feel like all i ever do is
find different ways to word the same old song
ever since i came along
from the day the song called hi my name is dropped
started thinking my name was fault
cause any time things went wrong
i was the one who they would blame it on
the media made me the equivalent
of a modernday genghis khan
tried to argue it was only entertainment dog
gangster nah courageous balls
had to change my style they said im way too soft
and i sound like az and nas out came the claws
and the fangs been out since then
but up until the instant that i went against it
it was ingrained in me
that i wouldnt amount to a shit stain i thought
no wonder i had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
do i really belong in this game i pondered
i just wanna play my part
should i make waves or not
so back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
and i dont wanna seem ungrateful
or disrespect the art form i was raised upon
but sometimes you gotta take a loss
and have people rub it in your face
before you get made pissed off
and keep plugging its your only outlet
and your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah
feel like ive already said this a kabillion eighty times
how many times can i say the same thing
different ways that rhyme
what i really wanna say is if theres anyone else that can relate to my story bet you feel the same way i felt
when i was in the same place you are when i was afraid to

feels like a close its coming to
fuck am i gonna do
its too late to start over
this is the only thing i thing i know

i know what it was like i was there once
single parents hate your appearance
as you struggle to find your place in this world
and the pain spawns all the anger on
but it wasnt til i put the pain in song
learned who to aim it on that i made a spark
started to spit harder shit
learned how to harness it while the reins were off
and there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part
was soon as i stopped saying i gave a fuck
haters started to appreciate my art
and it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain i caused
but what am i gonna do when the rage is gone
and the lights go out in that trailer park
and the window is closing and theres nowhere else that i can go with flows and im frozen
cause theres no more emotion for me to pull from
just a bunch of playful songs that i make for fun
so to the break of dawn here i go recycling the same old song
but i rather make not afraid two
than make another motherfucking we made you ah
now i dont wanna seem indulgent
when i discuss my lows and my highs
my demise and my uprise pray to god
i just open enough eyes later on
and gave you the supplies and the tools
to hopefully use thatll make you strong
enough to lift yourself up when you feel like i felt
cause i cant explain to yall how dang exhausted my legs felt
just having to balance my dang self
when on eggshells i was made to walk
but thank you ma cause that gave me the
strength to cause shadymania so when they empty that stadium
least i made it out of that house
and found a place in this world when the day was done
so this is for every kid who alls they ever did
was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
i represent him or her anyone similar
you are the reason that i made this song
and everything youre scared to say
dont be afraid to say no more
from this day forward just let them aholes talk
take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
the legend of the angry blond
lives on through you when im gone and to think i was a


in my mind im a fighter my hearts a lighter
my soul is the fluid my flow sparks it right up
an arsenic writer author with arthritis
carpaltunnel marshall with startshititis
hardheaded and hotheaded
bullheaded and pigheaded dickheaded a prick
a big headache im sick quickwitted for every lyric spitted
there are six critics who wait for me to slip with it
so quick this dynamite stick bury the wick
its gonna explode any minute
some lunatic lit it and its not nelly
do not tell me to stop yelling
when i stop selling ill quit so stop dwelling
i am not failing you fuckers are not ready
cause i got jelly like beyoncés pot belly
this is destiny yes money im off running
so get off of me im not slowing or softening

no apologies nah suckers im not sorry
you can all sue me yall could be the cause of me
no apologies yall feeling the force of me
no remorse for me like there was no recourse for me
no apologies not even acknowledging you at all
til i get a call that gods coming
no apologies laugh fuckers its all funny
i can spit in your face while youre standing across from me
no apologies

my head hits the pillow a weeping willow
i cant sleep a pain so deep it bellows
but these cellos help just to keep me mellow
hands on my head touch knees to elbows
im hunched over emotion just flows over
these cold shoulders are both frozen you dont know me
i keep saying it i cant stress it enough
so keep playing it and stand next to the subs
i choke mics like asphyxiation
when im strangling my own throat masturbatin
fuck yeah im a basket case and
i master this rap shit til my ass gets wasted
til my assassination
til im slain because of some fags infatuation
fortyfour mags fascination
a taste for disaster and if thats the case then

no apologies nah suckers im not sorry
you can all sue me yall could be the cause of me
no apologies yall feeling the force of me
no remorse for me like there was no recourse for me
no apologies not even acknowledging you at all
til i get a call that gods coming
no apologies laugh fuckers its all funny
i can spit in your face while youre standing across from me
no apologies

this song isnt for you its for me
a true mc its what hell do just to see
if he still has it and if his skills mastered
hes able to spill raps long after hes killed thats a
real mc got you feelin me
whether willing or unwillingly you still agree
as long as theres still this hunger and will in me
then expect a longer life expectancy
id be a savage beast if i aint had this
outlet to salvage me inside
id be exploding soaked in selfloathing
and mourning so im warning you dont coax me
its silly im really a sheep in wolfs clothing
who only reacts when he gets pushed dont be
fooled the press blows up this whole thing
its stupid they dont know cause they dont see
that im wounded all they did was ballooned it
im sick of talkin about these tattoos cartoon did
thats why i tuned it out im sick of dukin
they can suck my dick while im pukin
and you too you can

expect no sympathy from me
im an mc this is how im supposed to be
cold as a g my hearts frozen
it dont even beat so expect no apologies
expect no sympathy from me
im an mc this is how im supposed to be
cold as a g my hearts frozen
it dont even beat so expect no apologies


when me and fif got together to do this music
the more we became enveloped
we just developed a fellowship through it
its no pretend shit its friendship mi nemesis es su nemesis
same for him its just media see to them its just images
but this shit is no gimmicks this is blood in and blood out
when its beef you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
if theres a problem we solve it if we dont resolve it
it usually just evolves into one big brawl
and we all get involved in it
and we should all get a merit this much beef we inherit
and wear it like a badge with honor pass it around and share it
and let it go to whoevers holdin
the most current beef on their shoulders
and their soldiers got their backs til its over

hello what up hello
yo i cant i cant hear you
let me call you right back

i sense someones tappin into my phones why do
i got this feeling in my bones i might die soon
the fbi might be tryin to pull my file soon
i might be walkin blindfold into a typhoon
i might be seein rockets light up the night sky
right outside the window of my living room
and if they do you can say good night
and byebye to them my tunes
if i dont try to record as much before i do
the plan is to have as many in the can as i can
as i stand before you in this booth a walkingdead man
blank stare dead pan look on my face
as i gaze into space as i wait to be scooped up in that van
as i mysteriously disappear into thin air
and they gonna say a sniper just appeared outta nowhere
and ill go down in the history as the bloodsuckin leech
who hid behind the freedom of speech
tried to take the fiveth amendment use it twist it and bend it
and ended up dyin the villain not the hero splendid
stupendous way to end this
i can feel the tremors tremendous
in remembrance of september eleventh
flashback to september seventh
when twopac was murdered in vegas
he said it he predicted his own death let us never forget it
should we ever live to regret it
like the day john f kennedy was assassinated in broad day
by the crazed lunatic with a gun
who just happened to work on the same block
in the library book depository
where the president would go for a little friday stroll
shots fired from the grassy knoll
but they dont know or do they
whos they for them to say touché
were all vulnerable and its spookay
this is about as kookay as ive ever felt now
count down to nuclear meltdown
seven six five four three two one
you can run you can do what you want to
but you know you aint gonna do nothin
when its time its your time you are the prime target
you have become public enemy number one


shady were back

nothing can stop and nothing can change it
you better just make new livin arrangements
if you think you the top and king of the castle
you about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
all i hear is im the best at this and im best at that
but i dont hear my name no neer brought up in rap
and i dont usually trip or dare get caught up in that
but when they say one of the best im nowhere thought of as that
not even the same league as jayz nas pac biggie or maybe
theyll name me somewhere down at the bottom right after az
or say he ripped that biggie verse or that jayz
ayo his verses were crazy on that renegade beat
but i aint never bought no whole cd of shady
and all i hear is pop tunes come on the radi
o and they play em twenty times in a row daily
and that very well maybe the same reason they dont say me
when they speak on hiphop legends which has amazed me
cause i thought the formula was to hit mainstream
and make it bigbabigbig baybababy

caught in a chase twentyfive to life
too late for the other side
caught in a chase twentyfive to life
too late
i cant keep chasing you
im taking my life back
caught in a chase twentyfive to life

i dont think she understands the sacrifices that ive made
maybe if this bitch had acted right i woulda stayed
but ive already wasted over half my life i woulda laid
down and died for you i no longer cry for you no more pain
bitch you took me for granted
took my heart and ran it straight into the planet
into the dirt i can no longer stand it now my respect i demand it
ima take control of this relationship command it
and ima be the boss of you now goddamn it
and what i mean is that i will no longer let you control me
so you better hear me out this much you owe me
i gave up my life for you totally devoted to you i have stayed
faithful all the way this is how i fuckin get repaid
look at how i dress fuckin baggy sweats go to work a mess
always in a rush to get back to you i aint heard you yet
not even once say you appreciate me i deserve respect
ive done my best to give you nothin less than perfectness
and i know that if i end this ill no longer have nothin left
but you keep treatin me like a staircase its time to fuckin step
and i wont be comin back so dont hold your fuckin breath
you know what youve done no need to go indepth
i told you youd be sorry if i fuckin left
i laughed while you wept hows it feel now
yeah funny aint it you neglected me
did me a favor though my spirit free youve set
but a special place for you in my heart i have kept
its unfortunate but its

too late for the other side
caught in a chase twentyfive to life
cant take no more
too late for the other side
caught in a chase twentyfive to life

i feel like when i bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
cause that aint good enough
you expect me to fold myself in half til i snap
dont think im loyal all i do is rap
how can i moonlight on the side i have no life outside of that
dont i give you enough of my time you dont think so do you
jealous when i spend time with the girls
why im married to you still man i dont know
but tonight im serving you with papers
im divorcing you  go marry someone else and make em famous
and take away their freedom like you did to me
treat em like you dont need em and they aint worthy of you
feed em the same shit that you made me eat
im moving on forget you
oh now im special i aint feel special when i was with you
all i ever felt was this helplessness imprisoned by a selfish bitch
chew me up and spit me out i fell for this
so many times its ridiculous
and still i stick with this im sick of this
but in my sickness and addiction youre addictive as they get
evil as they come vindictive as they make em
my friends keep askin me why i cant just walk away from
im addicted to the pain the stress the drama
im drawn to shit i guess im a
mess cursed and blessed but this time i
aint changin my mind im climbin out this abyss
youre screamin as i walk out that ill be missed
but when you spoke of people
who meant the most to you you left me off your list
fuck you hip hop im leavin you
my life sentence is served bitch and its just

too late for the other side
caught in a chase twentyfive to life
im gone man
too late for the other side
caught in a chase twentyfive to life
too late
caught in a chase twentyfive to life

i guess i keep talkin to myself
but all these other rappers suck is all that i know
ive turned into a hater i put up a false bravado
but marshall is not an egomaniac thats not his motto
hes not a desperado hes desperate
his thoughts are bottled inside him
one foot on the brake one on the throttle
fallin asleep with writers block in the parkin lot of mcdonalds
but instead of feeling sorry for yourself
do something bout it admit you got a problem
your brain is clouded you pouted long enough
it isnt them its you you fuckin baby
quit worryin bout what they do and do shady

and everything ive come from

but they can do little to the middle finger
i think i got a tear in my eye i feel like the king of
my world haters can make like bees with no stingers
and drop dead no more beef lingers
no more drama from now on i promise
to focus solely on handlin my responsibilities as a father
so i solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
and raise it you couldnt lift a single shingle on it
cause the way i feel im strong enough to go to the club

garbage bag for one of the windows
spraypainted doors with the flames on em
michigan plates and my names on em
baby shadys here come and get him if you dames want him
but he aint stupid so quit tryna run them games on him
hes immune to cupid why you tryna put your claims on him
cause you wont do to me what you did to the last man

theres a half a gallon in it that could be our last chance
we have of just gettin home now can i get that lap dance

but everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
so get on the floor and grab somebody

so lets have us a little bash
and if anyone asks it aint no one but us trash
you dont know you better ask somebody
cause were having a white trash party white trash party

pull a fifth of bacardi from out of my underwear
and walk around the party without a care
like a body without a head
lookin like a zombie from night of the living dead
and tomorrow ill probably still be too high to get out of bed
til i feel like i been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
im mixin hennessy and fanta with pepto and mylanta
i shoot the gift like im hollering die santa
missed the tree and hit rudolph and two innocent bystanders
so quit tryna play the wall like you paul
and get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin
they call me the stephon marbury of rap darlin
cause as soon as they throw on some r kelly i start ballin
makin it rain for the ladies in the minis
but im not throwin ones fives tens or even twenties
im throwin quarters nickels dimes pennies up at skinnies
man i do this for them bunnies up at dennys
from the north east and west
but when it comes to them trailers in them south parks
muffle it cause homie that hoods tighter than kennys
so ladies if your belly buttons not an innie then im outtie
now hop in my minivan lets get rowdy
come on

now you can do this on your own
but everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
so get on the floor and grab somebody
aint nothin but a white trash party white trash party
so lets have us a little bash
and if anyone asks it aint no one but us trash
you dont know you better ask somebody
cause were having a white trash party

now whether youre black white or purple
if youre misunderstood
but you dont give a fuck you aint doin shit that you should
long as you know youre up to evil and youre no damn good
get on the floor man and rep your hood

now honey dont let them pricks trip
we should make a quick dip
and go do some doughnuts in the hospital parking lot
cause girl i got a sick whip
kick the back window outta my gremlin
put two milk crates in the trunk rip out the stick shift
and make a fiveseater ill be damned if i feed a chick
it aint like me to split a piece of dry pita
i be the sltotheim to the shady
and i dont need a tank top to be a wife beater
ill rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
fore i turn over a new leaf clown
ill tell you now im so raw i still need to unthaw
you feel me yall i shut the club down like drake in the mall
but baby a body like thats against the law
you the baddest little chain with the blades i ever saw
coleslaw containers empty straw wrappers and all
you got more junk in your trunk than i do in my car
now get up

now you can do this on your own
but everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
so get on the floor and grab somebody
aint nothin but a white trash party
so lets have us a little bash
and if anyone asks it aint no one but us trash
you dont know you better ask somebody
cause were having a white trash party


i cant tell you what it really is i can only tell you what it feels like
and right now its a steel knife in my windpipe
i cant breathe but i still fight while i can fight
as long as the wrong feels right its like im in flight
high off her love drunk from her hate
its like im huffin paint and i love her the more i suffer i suffocate
and right before im about to drown she resuscitates me
she fuckin hates me and i love it wait where you going
im leaving you no you aint come back
were runnin right back here we go again
its so insane cause when its goin good its goin great
im superman with the wind at his back shes lois lane
but when its bad its awful i feel so ashamed
i snap whos that dude i dont even know his name
i laid hands on her ill never stoop so low again
i guess i dont know my own strength

you ever love somebody so much
you can barely breathe when youre with em
you meet and neither one of you even know what hit em
got that warm fuzzy feelin yeah them chills used to get em
now youre gettin fuckin sick of lookin at em
you swore youd never hit em never do nothin to hurt em
now youre in each others face
spewin venom in your words when you spit em
you push pull each others hair scratch claw bit em
throw em down pin em
so lost in the moments when youre in em
its the rage thats the culprit  it controls you both
so they say its best to go your separate ways
guess that they dont know ya
cause today that was yesterday yesterday is over
its a different day sound like broken records playin over
but you promised her next time youd show restraint
you dont get another chance life is no nintendo game
but you lied again
now you get to watch her leave out the window
guess thats why they call it window pane

now i know we said things did things that we didnt mean
and we fall back into the same patterns same routines
but your tempers just as bad as mine is
youre the same as me when it comes to love
youre just as blinded baby please
come back it wasnt you baby it was me
maybe our relationship isnt as crazy as it seems
maybe thats what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
all i know is i love you too much to walk away though
come inside pick up your bags off the sidewalk
dont you hear sincerity in my voice when i talk
told you this is my fault look me in the eyeball
next time im pissed ill aim my fist at the drywall
next time there wont be no next time
i apologize even though i know its lies
im tired of the games i just want her back
i know im a liar if she ever tries to fuckin leave again
ima tie her to the bed and set this house on fire im just gonna


we touch i feel a rush we clutch it isnt much
but its enough to make me wonder whats in store for us
its lust its torturous you must be a sorceress
cause you just did the impossible gained my trust
dont play games itll be dangerous
if you fuck me over cause if i get burnt ima show ya
what its like to hurt cause i been treated like dirt before ya
and love is evil  spell it backwards ill show ya
nobody knows me im cold walk down this road all alone
its no ones fault but my own its the path ive chosen to go
frozen as snow i show no emotion whatsoever so
dont ask me why i have no love for these muhfuckin hoes
bloodsuckin succubuses what the fuck is up with this
ive tried in this department but i aint had no luck with this
it sucks but its exactly what i thought it would be
like tryin to start over i got a hole in my heart
but some kind of emotional roller coaster
is something i wont go on
so you toy with my emotions so its over
its like an explosion every time i hold ya
wasnt joking when i told ya
you take my breath away youre a supernova and im a

ill do whatever it takes when im with you i get the shakes
my body aches when i aint with you i have zero strength
theres no limit on how far i would go no boundaries no lengths
why do we say that until we get that person that we thinks
gonna be that one and then once we get em its never the same
you want em when they dont want you
soon as they do feelings change
its not a contest and i aint on no conquest for no mate
i wasnt lookin when i stumbled on to you musta been fate
but so much is at stake what the fuck does it take
lets cut to the chase fore the door shuts in your face
promise me if i cave in and break and leave myself open
that i wont be makin a mistake cause im a

so after a year and six months its no longer me that you want

hes intubated and were bagging him now
uh bp ninety over palp patient is cool pale and diaphoretic
has aspirated uh gsc is three
will update en route eta ten minutes

as i fall deeper into a manic state
im a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict trait
blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
i seem to gravitate to the bottle of nyquil then i salivate
start off with the nyquil like i think ill just have a taste
couple of sips of that then i gradually graduate
to a harder prescription drug called valium like yeah thats great
i go to just take one and i end up like having eight
now i need something in my stomach cause i havent ate
maybe ill grab a plate of nachos and ill have a steak
and youd think that with all i have at stake
look at my daughters face
mommy something is wrong with dad i think
hes acting weird again hes really beginning to scare me
wont shave his beard again and he pretends he doesnt hear me
and all he does is eat doritos and cheetos
and he just fell asleep in his car eating three musketeers in the rear seat

sometimes i feel so alone i just dont know
feels like i been down this road before
so lonely and cold its like something takes over me
as soon as i go home and close the door
kinda feels like déjà vu
i wanna get away from this place i do
but i cant and i wont say i try but i know thats a lie
cause i dont and why i just dont know

maybe just a nice cold brew whats a beer
thats the devil in my ear ive been sober a fuckin year
and that fucker still talks to me hes all i can fucking hear
marshall come on well watch the game
its the cowboys and buccaneers
and maybe if i just drink half ill be halfbuzzed
for half of the time whos the mastermind behind that little line
with that kind of rationale man i got half a mind
to have another half a glass of wine sounds asinine
yeah i know  but i never had no problem with alcohol
ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch im bout to fall
i miss the couch and down i go lookin like a bouncy ball
shit mustve knocked me out cause i aint feel the ground at all

theres thunder i wonder how come it rains but the sun is out
the devils upset with his wife they must be sluggin it out
i must be buggin the fuck out but what the fuck about
voices are leading me up to the attic i love my house
they pull and they tug my blouse the sound of a music box
comes from inside a toy chest but what do i do its locked
i pick it and open it but its stuffed full of human parts
i dig til i find it i wind it up and the tune just starts
its playing a song so beautiful and the room is dark
the moon is full i smell a funeral guess ill loom in the park

my music box
cause when the lights are off i see the girls asleep
my music box
but i can hear you my love you keep calling me
my music box

im fixated on asphyxiatin and breakin
this little chicks neck like a pixy stick
the sick satanworshippin bitches get horse whippings
im in the back through the back door slippin
through the crack leavin the corpse drippin
the mortician of love sent from above
forced entry the more wenchy the more stingy i become
been doing this for more than a quartercentury im just numb
am i dreaming is it real someone pinch me on the buns
the time has come to tie her up gotta roll me the ladder
ive had enough of the chatter
climb up to the window look at her
then climb in slow to shatter her brain matter and batter her
with a bat a matter of fact that will splatter her
but before i do that ill have a chat to flatter her
give her two compliments back to back like tabitha
im your secret admirer im back to ravish ya
so strong is your fight but youre no match for dracula
prolonging her plight as i go back to stabbin her
dismember her limbs simple as that cadaver her
zoom in with the lens then pan back the camera
stand back cause here comes your man jack so pamela

my music box
cause when the lights are off i see the girls asleep
my music box
but i can hear you my love you keep calling me
my music box

so once you call i come i will answer
my music box
cause when the lights are off i see the girls asleep

the world is mine


lately ive been hard to reach
ive been too long on my own
everybody has a private world
where they can be alone
are you calling me
are you trying to get through
are you reaching out for me
then im reaching out for you

im just so fuckin depressed
i just cant seem to get out this slump
if i could just get over this hump
but i need somethin to pull me out this dump
i took my bruises took my lumps
fell down and i got right back up
but i need that spark to get psyched back up
in order for me to pick the mic back up
i dont know how or why or when
i ended up in this position im in
im starting to feel distant again
so i decided just to pick this pen
up and try to make an attempt to vent
but i just cant admit or come to grips with the fact
that i may be done with rap i need a new outlet
and i know some shits so hard to swallow
but i just cant sit back and wallow
in my own sorrow but i know one fact
ill be one tough act to follow one tough act to follow
ill be one tough act to follow
here today gone tomorrow
but youd have to walk a thousand miles

in my shoes just to see what its like to be me
ill be you lets trade shoes
just to see what itd be like to
feel your pain you feel mine
go inside each others minds
just to see what we find
look at shit through each others eyes
but dont let em say you aint beautiful
they can all get fucked just stay true to you
dont let em say you aint beautiful
they can all get fucked just stay true to you

i think im starting to lose my sense of humor
everythings so tense and gloom
i almost feel like i gotta check the temperature
of the room just as soon as
i walk in its like all eyes on me
so i try to avoid any eye contact
cause if i do that then it opens a door
for conversation like i want that
im not lookin for extra attention
i just wanna be just like you
blend in with the rest of the room
maybe just point me to the closest restroom
i dont need no fuckin manservant
tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
laugh at every single joke i crack
and half of em aint even funny like ha
marshall youre so funny man
you should be a comedian goddamn
unfortunately i am
i just hide behind the tears of a clown
so why dont you all sit down
listen to the tale im about to tell
hell we dont gotta trade our shoes
and you aint gotta walk no thousand miles

in my shoes just to see what its like to be me
ill be you lets trade shoes
just to see what itd be like to
feel your pain you feel mine
go inside each others minds
just to see what we find
look at shit through each others eyes
but dont let em say you aint beautiful
they can all get fucked just stay true to you
dont let em say you aint beautiful
they can all get fucked just stay true to you

nobody asked for life to deal us
with these bullshit hands were dealt
we gotta take these cards ourselves
and flip em dont expect no help
now i couldve either just sat on my ass
and pissed and moaned
or take this situation in which im placed in
and get up and get my own
i was never the type of kid
to wait by the door and pack his bags
and sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
for a dad to show up who never did
i just wanted to fit in in every single place
every school i went i dreamed of being that cool kid
even if it meant acting stupid
aunt edna always told me
keep making that face itll get stuck like that
meanwhile im just standin there
holdin my tongue tryin to talk like this
til i stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole
at eight years old i learned my lesson then
cause i wasnt tryin to impress my friends no mo
but i already told you my whole life story
not just based on my description
cause where you see it from where youre sittin
its probably one hundred and ten different
i guess we would have to walk a mile
in each others shoes at least
what size you wear i wear tens
lets see if you can fit your feet

in my shoes just to see what its like to be me
ill be you lets trade shoes
just to see what itd be like to
feel your pain you feel mine
go inside each others minds
just to see what we find
look at shit through each others eyes
but dont let em say you aint beautiful
they can all get fucked just stay true to you
dont let em say you aint beautiful
they can all get fucked just stay true to you

and just when i went to drink his blood
i thought i oughta drink his bathwater that oughta be fun

the sight of blood excites me that might be an artery son

to just cut loose
so thisll be the part of the song that they drop the needle on
and hell breaks loose

this is when shit hits the fan like it just splattered on stan
this is the only moment that matters
your homie rolled in with mathers

take a day off of what man you better lay off the blunts

yeah look
if i were to rap about the crap thats out
thats the route you probably want me to take
cause youre just dyin to know what i think
hear my take on some other rappers
if i was to say somethin about paul wall
youd probably crap in your pants cause im white and hes white
so hes like my competition i mean right
nope paul wall is dope and so is bubba
so bbbbbb but i dont compete with nobody
i just go hard do the ropeadope ali shuffle
and dance around my opponents do donuts
sometimes i play possum like im asleep its awesome
im like a sleepin giant and when i awake im like dre
i just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
and sink my teeth in em and fill em
full of poison and make a noise like a snake before i kill em
and let em know that i just dont feel em
and smack em with the backward e the eminem emblem
i was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face him
tell him why look him dead in the eye then waste him
and the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
then swallow the shell all the hollow who dwell
in the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
for this rap game and it gggoes
onetwothree chkchk onetwothree
chkchk onetwothree that aint the hook now follow me
theres nothing else for me to say my public adores me

so this is it this is what i wished for
just isnt how i envisioned it fame to the point of imprisonment
i just thought the shitd be different
but somethin changed the minute that i got a whiff of it
i started to inhale it smell it started sniffin it
and it became my cocaine i just couldnt quit
i just wanted a little bit then it turned me to a monster
i became a hypocrite concert after concert
i was rakin in the dough rollin in green
had the game hemmed up like a sewing machine
but i was losing my freedom there was nowhere for me
to not go and be seen and just go and be me
and there was no inbetween you either loved it or hate it
every cd critics gave it a three then three
years later they go back and rerate it
then called the slim shady lp the greatest
the marshall mathers was a classic
the eminem show was fantastic
but encore just didnt have the caliber to match it
i guess enough time just aint passed yet
a couple more years that shitll be illmatic
and eight years later im still at it

and this is real talk i feel like the incredible hulk

every day and for some reason
its been weighing on my mind heavy
cause i dont read every letter i get
but something told me to go ahead and open it
but why would someone pray for you
when they dont know you
you didnt pray for me when i was local
and as i lay these vocals i think of all the shit i had to go through
just to get to where im at ive already told you
at least a thousand times in these rhymes
i appreciate the prayer but ive already got god on my side
and its been one hell of a ride hasnt it
just watching it from a opposite standpoint
man boys got to look
nuts and thats the only word i can think of
right now on how to describe the shit
this is like a vibe you get go ahead and bop to it
just watch what you wish for cause i got the shit

so be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it
and if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it
cause it might just come back on you tenfold
i said be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it
and if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it
cause it might just come back on you tenfold

and came out with a little scratch ooh

insanity can it be vanity
wheres the humanity in having a twisted fantasy
with an armandleg amputee
straitjacket with a hundred and eight brackets
and a strap that wraps twice around my back
then they latch it cut your fuckin head off
and ask where youre headed off to
get it headed off to medic this headaches awful
this anesthetics pathetic so is this diabetic waffle
and this prosthetic arm keeps crushin my hard taco

so i can beat the sense in your elite defense
i got some meat to mince
a crew to stomp and then two feet to rinse
i greet the gents and ladies i spoil loyal fans
i foil plans and leave fluids leakin like oil pans
my coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
one thought in my cerebral
is deeper than a jeepfull of people
mcs are feeble i came to cause some pandemonium
battle a band of phony mcs and stand the lonely one

have you ever loved someone so much youd give an arm for
not the expression no literally give an arm for
when they know theyre your heart and you know you were their armor

what happens when you become the main source of her pain

step by step heart to heart
left right left
we all fall down

step by step heart to heart
left right left
we all fall down like toy soldiers
bit by bit torn apart
we never win
but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

im supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
i aint never supposed to show it my crew aint supposed to know it
even if it means goin toetotoe with a benzino
it dont matter i never drag em in battles that i cant handle
less i absolutely have to im supposed to set an example
i need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide em
if some shit ever does pop off im supposed to be beside em
that ja shit i tried to squash it it was too late to stop it
theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it
i heard him say hailies name on a song and i just lost it
it was crazy the shit went way beyond some jayz and nas shit
and even though the battle was won i feel like we lost it
i spent so much energy on it honestly im exhausted
and im so caught in it that i almost feel im the one who caused it
this aint what im in hiphop for thats not why i got in it
that was never my object for someone to get killed
why would i wanna destroy something i helped build
that wasnt my intentions my intentions were good
i went through my whole career without ever mentionin 
and that was just outta respect for not runnin my mouth
and talkin about somethin that i knew nothin about
plus dre told me stay out this just wasnt my beef
so i did i just fell back watched and gritted my teeth
while hes all over tv downtalkin the man
who literally saved my life like fuck it i understand
this is business and this shit just isnt none of my business
but still knowin the shit could pop off at any minute cause

step by step heart to heart
left right left
we all fall down like toy soldiers
bit by bit torn apart
we never win
but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dyin
but now its elevated cause once you put someones kids in it
the shit gets escalated  it aint just words no more is it
its a different ballgame you call names and you aint just rappin
we actually tried to stop the fifty and ja beef from happenin
me and dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
and asked him not to start it he wasnt gonna go after him
until ja started yappin in magazines how he stabbed him
fuck it fifty smash him mash on him let him have it
meanwhile my attentions pulled in another direction
some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk
has an erection for me and thinks that ill be his resurrection
tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
but now hes fucked the game up cause one of the ways i came up
was through that publication the same one that made me famous
now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin
well fuck it that motherfucker could get it too fuck him then
but im so busy bein pissed off i dont stop to think
that we just inherited fiftys beef with murder inc
and hes inherited mine which is fine aint like either of us mind
but we still have soldiers thats on the front line
whos willin to die for us as soon as we give the orders
never to extort us strictly to show they support us
and maybe shout em out in a rap or up in a chorus
to show em we love em back and let em know how important it is
to have runyon avenue soldiers up in our corners
their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
but i aint tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
it aint worth it i cant think of a perfecter way to word it
than to just say that i love yall too much to see the verdict
ill walk away from it all fore i let it go any further
but dont get it twisted its not a plea that im coppin
im just willin to be the bigger man if yall can quit poppin
off at the jaws well then i can cause frankly im sick of talkin
im not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience
cause

step by step heart to heart
left right left
we all fall down like toy soldiers
bit by bit torn apart
we never win
but the battle wages on for toy soldiers

i can see it in your eyes deep inside you wanna cry
cause youre scared i aint there

daddys here no more nightmares
we gon pull together through it
we gon do it lainieuncles crazy aint he

were all we got in this world when it spins when it swirls
when it whirls when it twirls two little beautiful girls
lookin puzzled in a daze i know its confusin you
daddys always on the move mommas always on the news
i try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
the harder that i try to do that the more it backfires on me
all the things growin up as daddy that he had to see
daddy dont want you to see but you see just as much as he did
we did not plan it to be this way your mother and me
but things have got so bad between us i dont see us ever bein
together ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
but then of course everything always happens for a reason
i guess it was never meant to be but its just something
we have no control over and thats what destiny is
but no more worries rest your head and go to sleep
maybe one day well wake up and thisll all just be a dream

now hush little baby dont you cry
everythings gonna be alright
stiffen that upper lip up little lady i told ya
daddys here to hold ya through the night
i know mommys not here right now and we dont know why
we feel how we feel inside
it may seem a little crazy pretty baby
but i promise mommas gon be alright heh

its funny i remember back one year when daddy had no money
mommy wrapped the christmas presents up and stuck em under the tree
and said some of em were from me cause daddy couldnt buy em
ill never forget that christmas i sat up the whole night cryin
cause daddy felt like a bumsee daddy had a job
but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
and at the time every house that we lived in
either kept gettin broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
and your mom was savin money for you in a jar
tryin to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
almost had a thousand dollars til someone broke in and stole it
and i know it hurt so bad it broke your mommas heart
and it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart
mom and dad was arguin a lot so momma moved back
on to chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
and dad moved back to the other side of eight mile on novara
and thats when daddy went to california with his cd
and met dr dre and flew you and momma out to see me
but daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me
then you started seein daddy on the tv and momma didnt like it
and you and lainie were too young to understand it
papa was a rolling stone momma developed a habit
and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud
now im sittin in this empty house
just reminiscin lookin at your baby pictures it just trips me out
to see how much you both have grown its almost like youre sisters now
wow guess you pretty much are and daddys still here
lainie im talkin to you too daddys still here
i like the sound of that yeah its got a ring to it dont it
sshh mommas only gone for the moment

now hush little baby dont you cry
everythings gonna be alright
stiffen that upper lip up little lady i told ya
daddys here to hold ya through the night
i know mommys not here right now and we dont know why
we feel how we feel inside
it may seem a little crazy pretty baby
but i promise mommas gon be alright

and if you ask me to daddys gonna buy you a mockingbird
ima give you the world
ima buy a diamond ring for you ima sing for you
ill do anything for you to see you smile
and if that mockingbird dont sing and that ring dont shine

and make him eat every carat dont fuck with dad haha


man whatever

dre just let it run
ayo turn the beat up a little bit
ayo
this song is for anyone
fuck it just shut up and listen
ayo

i sit back with this pack of zigzags and this bag
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
the most meanest mc on this on this earth
and since birth ive been cursed with this curse to just curse
and just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
and it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension
dispensing these sentences getting this stress
thats been eating me recently off of this chest
and i rest again peacefully
but at least have the decency in you
to leave me alone when you freaks see me out
in the streets when im eating or feeding my daughter
to not come and speak to me i dont know you
and no i dont owe you a mothafuckin thing
im not mr nsync im not what your friends think
im not mr friendly i can be a prick if you tempt me
my tank is on empty no patience is in me
and if you offend me im lifting you ten feet in the air
i dont care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit
ill smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
im tired of all you i dont mean to be mean
but thats all i can be its just me

and i am whatever you say i am
if i wasnt then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
radio wont even play my jam
cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasnt then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
i dont know thats just the way i am

sometimes i just feel like my father
i hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense
its constant and oh its his lyrical content
the song guilty conscience has gotten such rotten responses
and all of this controversy circles me
and it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me
so i point one back at em but not the index or pinkie
or the ring or the thumb its the one you put up
when you dont give a fuck when you wont just put up
with the bullshit they pull cause they full of shit too
when a dudes getting bullied and shoots up his school
and they blame it on marilyn and the heroin
where were the parents at and look where its at
middle america now its a tragedy
now its so sad to see an upperclass city havin this happening
then attack eminem cause i rap this way
but im glad cause they feed me the fuel that i need
for the fire to burn and its burning and i have returned

and i am whatever you say i am
if i wasnt then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
radio wont even play my jam
cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasnt then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
i dont know thats just the way i am

im so sick and tired of being admired
that i wish that i would just die or get fired
and dropped from my label lets stop with the fables
im not gonna be able to top on my name is
and pigeonholed into some poppy sensation
to cop me rotation at rocknroll stations
and i just do not got the patience
to deal with these cocky caucasians
who think im some wigger who just tries to be black
cause i talk with an accent and grab on my balls
so they always keep asking the same fucking questions
what school did i go to what hood i grew up in
the why the who what when the where and the how
til im grabbing my hair and im tearin it out
cause they driving me crazy i cant take it
im racin im pacin i stand and i sit
and im thankful for every fan that i get
but i cant take a shit
in the bathroom without someone standing by it
no i wont sign you an autograph
you can call me an asshole im glad

cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasnt then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
radio wont even play my jam
cause i am whatever you say i am
if i wasnt then why would i say i am
in the paper the news every day i am
i dont know thats just the way i am

theres not much you could do or say to phase me
people think im a little bit crazy
i get it from all angles even occasionally doc drezie
will have to step in every once in a while to save me
to make me stop and think about it fore i just say things
sometimes i forget what other people just may think
a lot of rappers probably wouldnt know how to take me
if they heard some shit id lay the tape fore they erased me
i may be a little too fastpaced and racy
sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me
twenty times cause i say so many rhymes it may seem
like im goin too fast cause my mind is racing
and i could give a fuck what category you place me
long as when im pushing up daisies
and gone as long as you place me amongst one of them greats
when i hit the heavenly gates ill be cool beside jayz
for every single diehard fan who embraced me
im thankful for the talent in which god gave me
and im thankful for the environment that he placed me
believe it or not i thank my mom for how she raised me
in the neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
it only made me what i am today see
regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
you aint gonna make or break me
tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake g
youre only gonna be in for a rude awakening
cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
and when you face me with all the shit youve been saving
to say to me you had all this time to think about it
now dont pussy out and try to about face me
cause ive been patiently waiting for the day
that we finally meet in the same place to see


i pledge allegiance to the flag
of the united states of america
and to the republic for which it stands
people
one nation under god indivisible
it feels so good to be back
with liberty and justice for all
mosh with me now

scrutinize every word memorize every line
i spit it once refuel reenergize and rewind
i give sight to the blind my insight through the mind
i exercise my right to express when i feel its time
its just all in your mind what you interpret it as
i say to fight and you take it as ima whip someones ass
if you dont understand dont even bother to ask
a father who has grown up with a fatherless past
who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
or at least shows no difficulty multitaskin
and juggling both perhaps mastered his craft slash
entrepreneur whos helped launch a few more rap acts
whos had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
of his career typical manure moving past that

my aim was not to become what i became
with this level of fame
my soul is possessed by this devil
my new name is rain man

now in the bible it says
thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed have homosexual sex
unless of course you were given the consent to join in
then of course its intercourse and its bisexual sex
which isnt as bad
as long as you show some remorse for your actions
either before during or after
performing the act of that which
is normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases
that are more used by todays kids in a more derogatory way
but whos to say whats fair to say and what not to say
lets ask dr dre
dr dre what up
i got a question if i may yeah
is it gay to play puttputt golf with a friend yeah
and watch his butt butt when he tees off yeah
but but i aint done yet
in football the quarterback yells out huthut
while he reaches in another grown mans ass
grabs on his nuts but just what if
it was never meant it was just an accident
but he tripped fell slipped and his penis went in
his teeny tiny little round hiney and he didnt mean it
but his little weenie flinched just a little bit
and i dont need to go into any more details but
what if he pictured it as a females butt
is that gay i just need to clear things up
til then ill just walk around with a manly strut because

cause i aint got no legs
or no brain
nice to meet you hi my name is
i forgot my name
my aim was not to become what i became
with this level of fame
my soul is possessed by this devil
my new name is rain man

you find me offensive i find you offensive

when am i gonna come to my good senses
probably the day bush comes to my defenses
my spider sense is telling me spiderman is nearby
and my plan is to get him next
and open up a whoop ass canister
goddammit dre wheres the god damned beat yeah
anyway anyway i dont know how else to put it
this is the only thing that im good at
i am the bad guy kryptonite the green chronic
demonic yup yup dont worry im on it
i got it highfive nick lachey
stuck a pin in jessicas head and walked away
and as she flew around the room like a balloon
i grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can
and zoom i headed straight back to the neverland ranch
with a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwich
and i dont even gotta make no god damned sense
i just did a whole song and i didnt say shit

cause i aint got no legs
or no brain
nice to meet you hi my name is
i forgot my name
my aim was not to become what i became
with this level of fame
my soul is possessed by this devil

what we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough if you will to be saved not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls yeah their throwaway children
we seem to be approaching cmon an age of the gross burp
we all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents station and each generation should do a little bit better

all right come on lets cut the bullshit enough
lets get it started lets start addressin this issue and open it up
lets take this shit back to the basement and we can discuss
statements thats made on this tape and its whole origin of
the music that we all know and love the music we all enjoy

lets rewind it to eightynine when i was a boy
on the east side of detroit crossin eight mile into warren
into hick territory id like to share a story

sometimes id stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
just to get picked up to get me a lift to
eight mile and van dyke or steal a goddamn bike
from somebodys backyard and drop it off at the park
that was the halfway mark to meet kim had to walk
back to her mamas on chalmers after dark
to sneak me in the house when im kicked out my moms
thats about the time i first met proof
with goofy gary on the steps at osborn handin out some flyers
we was doin some talent shows at center line high
i told him to stop by and check us out sometime
he looked at me like im out my mind
shook his head like white boys dont know how to rhyme
i spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place
and we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
we was on the same shit that big daddy kane shit
where compound syllables sound combined
from that day we was down to ride
somehow we knew wed meet again somewhere down the line

sleeping outside the door waiting in line still
trying to get inside the club to see dtwelve perform
the fire marshals know the venues too small
people are wall to wall three thousand and some odd
fans and some cumwad from out the parking lot
gets in an argument over a parking spot
decides to pull his gun and lets a few of them off
missed who hes aiming for six feet aways the door
into st andrews hall now the strays flying all over the place
grazed one bitch in the face
another one of em came through the wall
before anyone could even hear the first shot go off

thank god im alive i gotta find denaun
and where the fuck is von he usually tucks one on him
wait a minute i think i just saw bizarre
nah i guess not what the fuck oh my god it was
i never saw him run so fast in my life

there she is on the ground being trampled
i go to grab her up by the damn hand but i cant pull her
god damn there just went another damn bullet
im hit my vest is barely able to handle it
its too thin if i get hit again i cant do it
i scoop dee follow bizarres path ran through it and

cant you see what you do to me baby
you make me crazy you make me act like a maniac
im like a lunatic you make me sick
youre truly the only one who can do this to me
you just make me get so crazy
i go schizo i get so insane i just go schizophrenic
one minute i wanna slit your throat the next i wanna sex
you make me crazy the way we act
like two maniacs in the sack
we fuck like two jackrabbits
and maybe thats a bad habit
cause the next day were right back at it
in the same exact pattern
what the fuck is the matter with us
we cant figure out if its lust or its love
whats that thats attractin us to each other
they say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
which would explain why youre such a motherfuckin bitch
but i stay and still stick it out with you
even though i just hit you today
but you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
just cause i came home late last night
crawled in bed and i woke you
but if theres one thing about you that i admire its baby
because you stay with me maybe cause youre as crazy as i am
cause when i look at you i can see an angel in your eyes
but if i look deeper inside i see your freakish little side
like a devil in disguise youre always full of surprises
always pullin devices out your purse little vibrators and dildoes
you fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore
youre only twentyfour but youre plenty more mature
than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
like theyre in middle school still
youre crazy sexy cool chill
and you play your position you never step outta line
even though i stay in your business youve always kept outta mine
i wonder whats on your mind
sometimes they say love is blind
maybe thats why the first time
i dotted your eye you aint see the sign
or maybe you did maybe you like being shoved
maybe cause were crazy in love

you are the ink to my paper what my pen is to my pad
the moral the very fiber the whole substance to my rap
you are my reason for being the meaning of my existence
if it wasnt for you i would never be able to spit this
as intense as i do and the irony is you rely on me
as much as i rely on you to inspire me like you do
you provide me the lighter fluid the fuel to my fire
youre my entire supply gas the match and igniter
the only way that i am able to stay so stable
is youre the legs to my table
if you were to break id fall on my face
but im always gonna make you feel i dont need you as much
as i really need you so you dont use it to your advantage
but youre essential to me youre the air i breathe i believe
if you ever leave me id probably have no reason to be
you are the kim to my marshall youre the slim to my shady
the dre to my eminem the alaina to my hailie
you are the word that im lookin for
when im tryin to describe how i feel inside
and the right one just wont come to my mind
youre like the pillar that props me up the beam that supports me
the bitch who never took half the wife who never divorced me
youre like the root to my evil you let my devil come out me
you let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me
and no matter how much too much is never enough
maybe cause were crazy in love


once you call my name out things will never be the same
they shouldve never let us get our foot in this game

ever since i was introduced to rap music
i been missing a screw like bishop in juice i could lose it
at any moment those who know me know it
so they probably told to go with the flow just so that
i dont explode and have another episode
where i let it go as far as the one with benzino did
im waiting for that next beef im cocked locked and loaded
im ready to go so bad
im going bananas my dicks so hard anna nicole could
use it to fucking pole vault with
oh shit i mean when she was still bloated
before they cut her stomach open and lypod it
anybody i throw flames at gets a name
its a game cause they know that they dont spit the same
its a shame what people do for ten minutes of fame
everyday its the same thing
people in this game try to buddybuddy us
just to get close enough to study us
everybody just wants to have something to do with that
they all trying get that stamp
they after that shadyaftermath money
its like a monopoly
they probably just now finally understand how to rob fully
fifty cent was like a fucking jackpot for me
and dre its like we hit the fucking lottery
and the damn slot machine at the same time as each other
why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers
when we rhyme with each other in time we discovered
that we had more in common that we thought with each other
both robbed of our mothers our fathers aint want us
what was wrong with us was it our fault
cause we started thinking god doesnt love us
two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time
what a coincidence it is cause when fifty got shot up in jamaica
queens i still remember the call up at chung king cause
big l had just got popped just a month before
if fifty lives hes getting dropped from columbia
two years later me and doc had to come and uhh
operate thats when he popped up at number one
and we aint never gonna stop if you wondering
even if im under the gun
you aint got to agree all the time with me or see eye to eye
therell always be animosity between you and i
but see the difference is if it is i could give a shit
im still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual
egos aside fore i bruise em all
swallow your pride fore i step on it with shoes you call
nikes earthlings how do you like these
you gotta love em look at the bottom of em theyre like cleats
stomping i been romping
since tim dog was hollering fuck compton
i was whiling freestyling
back when they were still making maxell casettes
i wasnt even raps elvis yet that tells us that
any doubts in your head that seals the shit
ricky ticky toc ticky ticky toc
still with the diggy diggy doc diggy diggy doc
and ya dont stop


eminem pukes into the toilet
eminem hocks and spits into the toilet
toilet flush
there i go thinking of you again

you dont know how sick you make me
you make me fucking sick to my stomach
every time i think of you i puke
you must just not knooooooow
you may not think you do but you do
every time i think of you i puke

i was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
but off of the dome would probably be a little more
more suitable for this type of song whoa
i got a million reasons off the top of my head that i could think of
sixteen bars just aint enough to put some ink to
so fuck it ima start right here ill just be brief im
bout to rattle off some of the reasons
i knew i shouldnt go and get another tattoo
of you on my arm but what do i go and do
i go and get another one now i got two oohoohoohoohoohoohooh
now im sitting here with your name on my skin
i cant believe i went and did this stupid shit again
my next girlfriend now her names gotta be kim shiiiiiiit
if you only knew how much i hated you
for every motherfucking thing youve ever put us through
then i wouldnt be standing here crying over you boooooooooooohoo

you dont know how sick you make me
you make me fucking sick to my stomach
every time i think of you i puke
you must just not knooooooow
you may not think you do but you do
every time i think of you i puke

i was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
but i thought a song would probably be a little better
instead of a letter that youd probably just shred up yeah
i stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
how much of a waste itd be for me to put some ink to a stupid piece of
paper id rather let you see how
much i fucking hate you in a freestyle
youre a fucking cokehead slut i hope you fucking die
i hope you get to hell and satan sticks a needle in your eye
i hate your fucking guts you fucking slut i hope you die diiiiiiie
but please dont get me wrong im not bitter or mad
its not that i still love you its not cause i want you back
its just that when i think of you it makes me wanna yack aaaaaaack
but what else can i do i havent got a clue
now i guess ill just move on i have no choice but to
but every time i think of you now all i wanna do is puuuuuuuke

you dont know how sick you make me
you make me fucking sick to my stomach
every time i think of you i puke
you must just not knooooooow
you may not think you do but you do
every time i think of you i puke

eminem pukes into the toilet
eminem hocks and spits into the toilet
toilet flush
eminem burps
ah damn
fucking bitch


i dont understand
why are you being so mean
youre a mean mean man

youre just jealous of me cause you you just cant do what i do
so instead of just admitting it you walk around and say
all kinds of really mean things about me
cause youre a meanie a meanie
but its only cause youre just really jealous of me
cause im what you wanna be so you just look like an idiot
when you say these mean things cause its too easy to see
youre really just a big weenie big weenie

all right listen i need you to focus
i need you to go dig deep in your mind this is important
we are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
im going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
now i need you to open your mind  your eyes close em
you are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
for the next four and a half minutes we are going to explore
into your mind to find out why youre so fucking jealous
now why did they make yoohoo pippitykakapoopoo
psyche im kidding i just wanted to see if youre still listening
okay now i need your undivided attention
sir i have a question why do i always sense this
undeniable tension from the moment that i enter into the room
it gets all quiet and whispers
whenever theres conversation why am i always mentioned
ive been dying to ask its been itching at me is it just because

youre just jealous of me cause you you just cant do what i do
so instead of just admitting it you walk around and say
all kinds of really mean things about me
cause youre a meanie a meanie
but its only cause youre just really jealous of me
cause im what you wanna be so you just look like an idiot
when you say these mean things cause its too easy to see
youre really just a big weenie big weenie

alright now i shit i just flubbed a line
i was going to say something extremely important
but i forgot who or what it was i fucked up
psyche im kidding again you idiot no i didnt
thats just what you wanted to hear from me is that i fucked up aint it
but i can bust one take without looking at no paper
it doesnt take a bunch of takes or me to stand here in this booth all day
for me to say the truth okay youre drooling you have tooth decay
your mouth is open youre disgusting what the fuck you eat for lunch
a bunch of sweets or something what you munch a bunch of crunch n munch
your tooth is rotten to the gum your breath stinks wanna chew some gum
yes i do sir what am i on you sir are on truth serum
marshall im so jealous of you please say you wont tell nobody
id be so embarrassed im just absolutely terrified
that someones gonna find out why im saying all these terrible
evil and awful mean things its my own insecurities

youre just jealous of me cause you you just cant do what i do
so instead of just admitting it you walk around and say
all kinds of really mean things about me
cause youre a meanie a meanie
but its only cause youre just really jealous of me
cause im what you wanna be so you just look like an idiot
when you say these mean things cause its too easy to see
youre really just a big weenie big weenie

alright now we were going to conduct
that experiment that we were talking about earlier
just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
cause thats exactly what your eyes look like wanna check to see
heres a mirror notice the resemblance here
wait let me put these sunglasses on now look in this mirror
how about now what do you have in common
youre both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on em
you look like i sound like singing about weenies
now take my weenie out of your mouth
this is between me and you i know youre not happy
i know youd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room
somewhere crying curled up in a ball tweaked
out of my mind dying theres no denying
that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
why you even doing this to yourself its pointless
why do we have to keep on going through this this is torturous
my point is this that if you say mean things
your weenie will shrink now i forgot what the chorus is youre just as

youre just jealous of me cause you you just cant do what i do
so instead of just admitting it you walk around and say
all kinds of really mean things about me
cause youre a meanie a meanie
but its only cause youre just really jealous of me
cause im what you wanna be so you just look like an idiot
when you say these mean things cause its too easy to see
youre really just a big weenie big weenie

fuck off my dick


crowd cheering
eminem humming to himself
checking mic

we still on
machinery starting
yo is the mic on
check check check aight its good lets go come on

machinery working
cheering intensifies
eminem eminem eminem
eminem eminem eminem
eminem eminem eminem
eminem eminem eminem


still love me take this
you ready one two three

the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me i just love you more
you dont want me i just want you more
i buy you flowers you throw em at me
i know its sad but its makin me happy
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
cause you love me and i love you more

its sick but who could ever predict wed be doin the same shit
we say we do it for our baby but we dont
we do it for us its lust cause neither one
of us trust each other so we fuck til we bust
and we cuss each other out
we know what its about shout
til i throw you out the house you throw me out the house
i throw you on the couch punch you in the mouth
fist fight til we turn this mother out
then apologize after laughter pain
its insane were back in the same chapter again
and its sad but its true when im layin here with you
there aint nothin anyone could ever say or ever do cause

the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me i just love you more
you dont want me i just want you more
i buy you flowers you throw em at me
i know its sad but its makin me happy
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
cause you love me and i love you more

cause i hate you do you hate me
good cause youre so fuckin beautiful when youre angry
it makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
on the bed and fuck you like i dont even know you
you fuck other people and i fuck other people
youre a slut but im equal im a mutt were both evil
in our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it
we can make accusations people spread rumors
but they aint got proof til they do its just the two of us
its you and me cause any chick can say that she screwin me
but you gotta believe me to a degree cause true indeed
if you didnt i wouldnt be hittin  yeah i would
cause the sex is too damn good if i ran who would i run to
that would be this soft and warm
so its off and on usually more off than on
but at least we know that we share this common bond
youre the only one i can fuck without a condom on
i hope the only reason that i cope is cause of that fact
and plus i can bust in that and thats why

the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me i just love you more
you dont want me i just want you more
i buy you flowers you throw em at me
i know its sad but its makin me happy
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
cause you love me and i love you more

i can never understand it thats why i dont try
from junior high until we both die its silly
oh why must we try is it really so rough
that we must always call each others billy goats gruff
try to pull each others legs until the other begs
were lyin to ourselves thats the beauty of it yeah
cause we truly love each other thats why we always fightin
all we do is shove each other every other fuckin night
and its clear it aint gonna change its pentup rage
we both had we both feel like weve been upstaged
by someone else weve both been someone elses someone else
problem is neither one wants help
its an addiction and it cant be fixed
our familys mixed up theres a baby sister in the mix
and it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle dont fit
and anybody who thinks they know us doesnt know shit
and theyre probably just tired of hearin it all the time
on every song every lyric and every rhyme
all the hoopla all of the whooptywoo
what you put me through fuckin whooptydo
but i wont be made a fool of if this is true love
you wouldnt do what you did last time you wouldnt screw up
this time cause this time girl im tellin you what
you do it again im fuckin you up

no matter what you say or what you do
ima hunt you down til i find you
no matter where you run ill be right there
right behind you in your nightmares
so i brought you the flowers and the candy
all the times that you threw it back at me
told me you hate me you gon hate me more
when you find out you cant escape me whore

the more you put me through
the more it makes me wanna come back to you
you say you hate me i just love you more
you dont want me i just want you more
i buy you flowers you throw em at me
i know its sad but its makin me happy
the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on
cause you love me and i love you more


if theres any bitches in this room
then theres somethin i gotta say say
for all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
ive been down that road
and now im back sittin on square one
tryin to pick myself up where i started from

spend some time with me say that youll be mine
i never thought id find someone to be mine
lord knows i was right cause you just crossed the line
spend some time with me say that youll be mine

i used to say i never met a girl like you before
still aint got a fuckin clue as to who you truly are
almost went as far as introducin you to my daughters
til you went as far as goin and snoopin through my drawers
now i just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
cant believe i almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
you used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
all i ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
if you recall i used to treat you like a groupie broad
when we fucked i refused to even take my jewelry off
but it threw me off the first time i called and you blew me off
it was a shock it struck me as odd but it turned me on
you started gettin moody on me pretty soon wed argue
and the ruder you got the more beautiful you got to me
and whoda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly
cupid could shoot another one of them goddamn darts at me
its true that i got shot in the heart but when someone seems
too good to be true they usually are but see
when youre in it its too hard to see
til you pull up and see some other dudes car parked and reach
up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
before you make a decision thats lifealtering
and just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
you hear them words echoing almost haunting that taunting ring

spend some time with me say that youll be mine
i never thought id find someone to be mine
lord knows i was right cause you just crossed the line
spend some time with me say that youll be mine

spend some time with me say that youll be mine
i never thought id find someone to be mine
lord knows i was right cause you just crossed the line
spend some time with me say that youll be mine

america ha ha ha we love you
how many people are proud to be citizens
of this beautiful country of ours the stripes and the stars
for the rights that men have died for to protect
the women and men who have broke their necks
for the freedom of speech the united states government has sworn to upholdor so were told
yo i want everybody to listen to the words of this song

i never wouldve dreamed in a million years id see
so many motherfuckin people who feel like me
who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
its like a fuckin army marchin in back of me
so many lives i touched so much anger aimed
in no particular direction just sprays and sprays
and straight through your radio waves it plays and plays
til it stays stuck in your head for days and days
who wouldve thought standin in this mirror bleachin my hair
with some peroxide reachin for a tshirt to wear
that i would catapult to the forefront of rap like this
how could i predict my words would have an impact like this
i mustve struck a chord with somebody up in the office
cause congress keep tellin me i aint causin nothin but problems
and now theyre sayin im in trouble with the government
im lovin it i shoveled shit all my life and now im dumpin it on

white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this
white america erica loves my shit
i go to trl look how many hugs i get
white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this
white america erica loves my shit
i go to trl look how many hugs i get

look at these eyes baby blue baby just like yourself
if they were brown shadyd lose shady sits on the shelf
but shadys cute shady knew shadys dimples would help
make ladies swoon baby ooh baby  look at my sales
lets do the math if i was black i woulda sold half
i aint have to graduate from lincoln high school to know that
but i could rap so fuck school im too cool to go back
give me the mic show me where the fuckin studios at
when i was underground no one gave a fuck i was white
no labels wanted to sign me almost gave up i was like
fuck it until i met dre the only one to look past
gave me a chance and i lit a fire up under his ass
helped him get back to the top every fan black that i got
was probly his in exchange for every white fan that hes got
like damn we just swapped sittin back lookin at shit wow
im like my skin is it startin to work to my benefit now

white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this
white america erica loves my shit
i go to trl look how many hugs i get
white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this
white america erica loves my shit
i go to trl look how many hugs i get

see the problem is i speak to suburban kids
who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
whose moms probly woulda never gave two squirts of piss
til i created so much motherfuckin turbulence
straight out the tube right into your livin rooms i came
and kids flipped when they knew i was produced by dre
thats all it took and they were instantly hooked right in
and they connected with me too because i looked like them
thats why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
searchin with a fine tooth comb its like this rope
waitin to choke tightenin around my throat
watchin me while i write this like i dont like this note
all i hear is lyrics lyrics constant controversy
sponsors working round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
surely hiphop was never a problem in harlem only in boston
after it bothered the fathers of daughters startin to blossom
so now im catchin the flak from these activists when they raggin
actin like im the first rapper to smack a bitch or say faggot shit
just look at me like im your closest pal
the posterchild the motherfuckin spokesman now for

white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this
white america erica loves my shit
i go to trl look how many hugs i get
white america i could be one of your kids
white america little eric looks just like this
white america erica loves my shit
i go to trl look how many hugs i get

so to the parents of america i am the derringer
aimed at little erica to attack her character
the ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
sent to lead the march right up to the steps of congress
and piss on the lawns of the white house
to burn the flag and replace it with a parental advisory sticker
to spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
fuck you ms cheney fuck you tipper gore
fuck you with the freest of speech this divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have fuck you

ha ha ha im just playin america
you know i love you

i almost break down and cry
sometimes i think im crazy im crazy oh so crazy

but then i see my baby suddenly im not crazy
it all makes sense when i look into her eyes oh no

cause sometimes fuck it feels like i was scared the worlds on my shoulders
everyones leanin on me
cause sometimes it feels like the worlds almost over
but then she comes back to me

my baby girl keeps gettin older
i watch her grow up with pride
people make jokes cause they dont understand me
they just dont see my real side
i act like shit dont faze me inside it drives me crazy
my insecurities could eat me alive
but then i see my baby suddenly im not crazy
it all makes sense when i look into her eyes oh no

cause sometimes it feels like the worlds on my shoulders
everyones leanin on me
cause sometimes it feels like the worlds almost over
but then she comes back to me

man if i could sing id keep singin this song to my daughter
if i could hit the notes id blow somethin as long as my father
to show her how i feel about her how proud i am that i got her
god im a daddy im so glad that her mom didnt reh tnaw
now you probably get this picture from my public persona
that im a pistolpackin drug addict who bags on his momma
but i wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
cause theres a lot of shit i keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul
and just know that i grow colder the older i grow
this boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
and this load is like the weight of the world and i think my neck is breakin
should i just give up or try to live up to these expectations
now look i love my daughter more than life in itself
but i got a wife thats determined to make my life livin hell
but i handle it well given the circumstances im dealt
so many chances man its too bad coulda had someone else
but the years that ive wasted is nothin to the tears that ive tasted
so heres what im facin three felonies six years of probation
ive went to jail for this woman ive been to bat for this woman
ive taken bats to peoples backs bent over backwards for this woman
man i shoulda seen it comin whatd i stick my penis up in
wouldnt have ripped the prenup up if ida seen what she was fuckin
but fuck it its over theres no more reason to cry no more
i got my baby baby the only lady that i adore
hailie so sayonara try tomorrow nice to know ya
our babys traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
and suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
its like the greatest gift you can get the weight has been lifted and

now it dont feel like the worlds on my shoulders
everyones leanin on me
cause my baby knows that her daddys a soldier
nothin can take her from me

inside of a hall with my framed autographed sunglasses
with elton johns name on my drag wall

all this time me and dre been fuckin with hats off
suck it marshall so tell laura and her husband to back off
fore i push this motherfuckin button and blast off
and launch one of these russians and thats all

knocking hailie tell em baby my dads lost it

theres really nothin else to say i i cant explain it
i think my dads gone crazy
a little help from hailie jade wont you tell em maybe
i think my dads gone crazy
theres nothin you could do or say that could ever change me
i think my dads gone crazy

i think my dads gone crazy crazy

its like my mother always told me
rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana and codeine and
goddamn it you little motherfucker
if you aint got nothin nice to say then dont say nothin
uh fuck that shit bitch
eat a motherfuckin dick chew on a prick
and lick a million motherfuckin cocks per second
id rather put out a motherfuckin gospel record
id rather be a pussywhipped bitch
eat pussy and have pussy lips glued to my face
with a clit ring in my nose than quit bringin my flows
quit givin me my ammo cant you see why im so mean

i think my dads gone crazy

i think my dads gone crazy
theres no one on earth that can save me not even hailie
i think my dads gone crazy crazy

my songs can make you cry take you by surprise
at the same time can make you dry your eyes
with the same rhyme see what youre seein
is a genius at work which to me isnt work
so its easy to misinterpret it at first cause when i speak
its tongueincheek id yank my fuckin teeth
before id ever bite my tongue id slice my gums
get struck by fuckin lightning twice at once
and die and come back as vanilla ices son
and walk around the rest of my life spit on
and kicked and hit with shit every time i sung
like r kelly as soon as bump and grind comes on
more pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl
inside of a plane aimed at the world trade
standin on ronnies grave screamin at the sky
til clouds gather its clyde mathers and bonnie jade
and thats pretty much the gist of it
parents are pissed but the kids love it
nine millimeter heaters stashed in twoseaters with meat cleavers
i dont blame you i wouldnt let hailie listen to me neither

theres really nothin else to say i i cant explain it
i think my dads gone crazy
a little help from hailie jade wont you tell em maybe
i think my dads gone crazy
theres nothin you could do or say that could ever change me
i think my dads gone crazy
theres no one on earth that can save me not even hailie
i think my dads gone crazy crazy

yo

never was a thug just infatuated with guns
never was a gangsta til i graduated to one
and got the rep of a villain for weapon concealing
took the image of a thug kept shit appealing
willin to stick out my neck for respect
if it meant life or death never live to regret what i said
when youre me people just wanna see if its true
if its youwhat you say in your raps what you do
so they feel its part of your obligation to fulfill
when they see you on the streets face to face are you for real
in confrontation aint no conversation if you feel
youre in violation any hesitationll get you killed
if you feel it kill it if you conceal it reveal it
being reasonablell leave you full of bullets
pull it squeeze it til its empty tempt me push me pussies
i need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

im a soldier these shoulders hold up so much
they wont budge ill never fall or fold up
im a soldier even if my collarbones crush or crumble
i will never slip or stumble
im a soldier these shoulders hold up so much
they wont budge ill never fall or fold up
im a soldier even if my collarbones crush or crumble
i will never stumble

i love pissing you off  it gets me off
like my lawyers when the fucking judge lets me off
all you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off
ill violate and all the motherfucking bets be off
im a lit fuse anything i do bitch its news
pistol whip a motherfucking bouncer sixtytwo
who needs bullets as soon as i pull it you sweat bullets
an excellent method to get rid of the next bully
its actually better cause instead of you murderin
you can hurt em and come back again and kick dirt at em
its like pouring salt in the wounds assault and get sued
you can smell the lawsuits soon as i waltz in the room
everybody halts and stops calls the cops
all you see is bitches coming out their halter tops
running and ducking out the hot rocks parking lot
youll all get shot whether its your fault or not cause im a

im a soldier these shoulders hold up so much
they wont budge ill never fall or fold up
im a soldier even if my collarbones crush or crumble
i will never slip or stumble
im a soldier these shoulders hold up so much
they wont budge ill never fall or fold up
im a soldier even if my collarbones crush or crumble
i will never stumble

i spit it slow so these kids know that im talkin to em
give it back to these damn critics and sock it to em
im like a thug with a little bit of pac influence
i spew it and look how i got you bitches rocking to it
you motherfuckers could never do it like i could do it
dont even try it youll look stupid do not pursue it
dont ever in your life try to knock the truest
i spit the illest shit ever been dropped in twoinch
so tickytock listen as the sound ticks on the clock
listen to the sound of kim as she licks on the cock
listen to the sound of me spillin my heart through this pen
motherfuckers know that ill never be marshall again
full of controversy until i retire my jersey
til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
and lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
and put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity im a

im a soldier these shoulders hold up so much
they wont budge ill never fall or fold up

i was born to brew up storms stir up shit
kick up dust cuss til i slur up spit
grew up too quick went through too much
knew too much shit corrupt
and ima pour it on like syrup bitch
thick and rich sick and twisted mr buttersworth
dre told me to milk this shit for what its worth
til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to earth
and if i fumble a verse keep going
first take i make mistakes just keep it
no punches pulled no punches thats weak shit
fake shit if i ever take shit ill eat shit

just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
so who you playing with huh

second verse it gets worse it gets no better than this
amateurs drink veteran piss from a dixie cup
if you ever mix me up
or confuse me with a canibus or dre with a dupri
well rub it in every club youre in
well have you blackballed
and make sure you never rap afuckinggain
dre aint having it long as im here to play devils advocate
if there was some magic shit i could wave over the industry
that could save it when im gone and buried
to make sure the tradition carries on i would
if i could only use this power for good
i wouldnt not even if i could
from the hood and im a hornet
and ima only sting when im cornered
and ima only sucker punch and swing without warning
and swing to knock somebodys fucking head off
cause i know if they get up
i wont get a chance to let off another punch
im punk rock no ones punk
dont give a fuck whitepac so much spunk
when i was little i knew i would blow up and sell a mil
or grow up to be attilla go nuts and be a killer
and im something of a phenom one puff of the chron
im unstoppable im alive and on top again
theres no obstacle that i cant conquer
so come along with us cmon

cause what you say is what you say
say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
so who you playing with huh

cause what you say is what you say
say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
so who you playing with huh

huh like my old lady
cause what you say is what you say
sometimes what you mean is two different things
depending on your mood if it swings
think too many things little hit of dres weed
i can do anything catch a contact and im gone
and im back i speed write
and my loose leafs my launchpad
and i can pull any string dont have to prove anything
catch a contract on your head
you headed west talk shit about dre
you better get a vest and invest
in something to protect your head and neck
and its back and forth all day like red and meth
i joke when i say im the best in the booth
but a lot of truth is said in jest
and if i ever do live to be a legend ima die a sudden death
five mics in the source aint holding my fucking breath
but ill suffocate for the respect
fore i breathe to collect a fucking check

cause what you say is what you say
say what you say how you say it whenever you saying it
just remember how you said it when you was spraying it
so who you playing with huh

these ideas are nightmares to white parents
whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
like whatever they say has no bearing
its so scary in a house that allows no swearing
to see him walkin around with his headphones blarin
alone in his own zone cold and he dont care hes
a problem child and what bothers him all comes out
when he talks about his fuckin dad walkin out bitch
cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out
if he ever saw him again hed probably knock him out
his thoughts are wacked hes mad so hes talkin back
talkin black brainwashed from rock and rap
he sags his pants dorags and a stockin cap
his stepfather hit him so he socked him back
and broke his nose his house is a broken home
theres no control he just lets his emotions go

come on sing with me sing sing for the year sing it
sing for the laughter and sing for the tear come on
sing it with me its just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

entertainment is changin intertwinin with gangsters
in the land of the killers a sinners mind is a sanctum
holy or unholy only have one homie
only this gun lonely cause dont anyone know me
yet everybody just feels like they can relate huhuh
i guess words are a motherfucker they can be great
or they can degrade or even worse they can teach hate
its like these kids hang on every single statement we make
like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum
now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
from standin on corners and porches just rappin
to havin a fortune no more kissin ass
but then these critics crucify you yep journalists try to burn you
fans turn on you attorneys all want a turn at you
to get they hands on every dime you have
they want you to lose your mind every time you mad
so they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
any dispute wont hesitate to produce handguns
thats why these prosecutors wanna convict me
strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
but all they kids be listenin to me religiously
so im signin cds while police fingerprint me
theyre for the judges daughter but his grudge is against me
if im such a fuckin menace this shit doesnt make sense b
its all political if my music is literal
and im a criminal how the fuck can i raise a little girl
i couldnt i wouldnt be fit to
youre full of shit too guerrera that was a fist that hit you bitch

come on sing with me sing sing for the year sing it
sing for the laughter and sing for the tear sing that shit
sing it with me its just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

they say music can alter moods and talk to you
well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too
well if it can then the next time you assault a dude
just tell the judge it was my fault and ill get sued
see what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols
and they wanna get one cause they think the shits cool
not knowin we really just protectin ourselves
we entertainers of course the shits affectin our sales
you ignoramus but music is reflection of self
we just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail
its fucked up aint it how we can come from practically nothin
to bein able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted
thats why we sing for these kids who dont have a thing
except for a dream and a fuckin rap magazine haha
who post pinup pictures on they walls all day long
idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
or for anyone whos ever been through shit in they lives
so they sit and they cry at night wishin theyd die
til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
were nothin to you but were the fuckin shit in they eyes
thats why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
squeeze it and hold it cause we consider these minutes golden
and maybe theyll admit it when were gone just let our spirits
live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can

sing with me sing sing for the year sing it
sing for the laughter and sing for the tear come on
sing it with me its just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

sing with me sing sing for the year sing it
sing for the laughter and sing for the tear come on
sing it with me its just for today
maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away


wheres my snare
i have no snare in my headphones
there you go yeah yo yo

have you ever been hated or discriminated against
i haveive been protested and demonstrated against
picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times
sick is the mind of the motherfuckin kid thats behind
all this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin
tempers flarin from parents just blow em off and keep goin
not takin nothin from no one give em hell long as im breathin
keep kickin ass in the morning and takin names in the evenin
leave em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
see they can trigger me but theyll never figure me out
look at me now i bet youre probly sick of me now
aint you mama ima make you look so ridiculous now

im sorry mama i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight im cleanin out my closet one more time
i said im sorry mama i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight im cleanin out my closet ha

i got some skeletons in my closet
and i dont know if no one knows it
so before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
ima expose it ill take you back to seventythree
before i ever had a multiplatinumselling cd
i was a baby maybe i was just a couple of months
my faggot father mustve had his panties up in a bunch
cause he split i wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
no i dont on second thought i just fuckin wished he would die
i look at hailie and i couldnt picture leavin her side
even if i hated kim id grit my teeth and id try
to make it work with her at least for hailies sake
i maybe made some mistakes
but im only human but im man enough to face em today
what i did was stupid no doubt it was dumb
but the smartest shit i did was take the bullets out of that gun
cause ida killed em shit i woulda shot kim and him both
its my life id like to welcome yall to the eminem show

im sorry mama i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight im cleanin out my closet one more time
i said im sorry mama i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight im cleanin out my closet uh

now i would never diss my own mama just to get recognition
take a second to listen fore you think this record is dissin
but put yourself in my position just try to envision
witnessin your mama poppin prescription pills in the kitchen
bitchin that someones always goin through her purse and shits missin
goin through public housing systems victim of münchausens syndrome
my whole life i was made to believe i was sick when i wasnt
til i grew up now i blew up it makes you sick to your stomach doesnt it
wasnt it the reason you made that cd for me ma
so you could try to justify the way you treated me ma
but guess what youre gettin older now and its cold when youre lonely
and nathans growin up so quick hes gonna know that youre phony
and hailies gettin so big now you should see her shes beautiful
but youll never see hershe wont even be at your funeral haha
see what hurts me the most is you wont admit you was wrong
bitch do your song keep tellin yourself that you was a mom
but how dare you try to take what you didnt help me to get
you selfish bitch i hope you fuckin burn in hell for this shit
remember when ronnie died and you said you wished it was me
well guess what i am deaddead to you as can be

im sorry mama i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight im cleanin out my closet one more time
i said im sorry mama i never meant to hurt you
i never meant to make you cry
but tonight im cleanin out my closet


cause sometimes you just feel tired feel weak
your left your left your left right left
and when you feel weak your left
you feel like you wanna just give up your left your left
but you gotta search within you right left
try to find that inner strength your left your left
and just pull that shit out of you your left
and get that motivation to not give up right left your left
and not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall
your left your left right left
flat on your face and collapse

til i collapse im spillin these raps long as you feel em
til the day that i drop youll never say that im not killin em
cause when i am not then ima stop pennin em
and i am not hiphop and im just not eminem
subliminal thoughts when ima stop sendin em
women are caught in webs spin em and hock venom
adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin to stop
amoxicillins just not real enough
the criminal copkillin hiphop villain
a minimal swap to cop millions of pac listeners
youre comin with me feel it or not
youre gonna fear it like i showed you the spirit of god lives in us
you hear it a lot lyrics to shock
is it a miracle or am i just product of pop fizzin up
fo shizzle my wizzle this is the plot listen up
you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fuck

music is like magic theres a certain feelin you get
when you real and you spit and people are feelin your shit
this is your moment and every single minute you spend
tryna hold on to it cause you may never get it again
so while youre in it try to get as much shit as you can
and when your run is over just admit when its at its end
cause im at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
i got a list heres the order of my list that its in
it goes reggie jayz twopac and biggie
andré from outkast jada kurupt nas and then me
but in this industry im the cause of a lot of envy
so when im not put on this list the shit does not offend me
thats why you see me walk around like nothings botherin me
even though half you people got a fuckin problem with me
you hate it but you know respect you got to give me
the presss wet dream like bobby and whitney  nate hit me

soon as a verse starts i eat at an mcs heart
what is he thinking how not to go against me smart
and its absurd how people hang on every word
ill probly never get the props i feel i ever deserve
but ill never be served my spot is forever reserved
if i ever leave earth that would be the death of me first
cause in my heart of hearts i know nothin could ever be worse
thats why im clever when i put together every verse
my thoughts are sporadic i act like im an addict
i rap like im addicted to smack like im kim mathers
but i dont wanna go forth and back in constant battles
the fact is i would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
so this is like a fullblown attack im launchin at em
the track is on some battlin raps who wants some static
cause i dont really think that the fact that im slim matters
a plaque and platinum status is whack if im not the baddest so

until the roof until the roof
the roof comes off the roof comes off
until my legs until my legs
give out from underneath me
i will not fall i will stand tall
feels like no one can beat me


saying goodbye saying goodbye to hollywood
saying goodbye saying goodbye to hollywood
saying goodbye saying goodbye to hollywood

i thought i had it all figured out i did
i thought i was tough enough to stick it out with kim
but i wasnt tough enough to juggle two things at once
i found myself laying on my knees in cuffs
which shouldve been a reason enough for me to get my stuff
and just leave how come i couldnt see this shit myself
its just me nobody couldnt see the shit i felt
knowing damn well she wasnt gonna be there when i fell
to catch me the minute shit was heated she just bailed
im standing here swinging on like thirty people by myself
i couldnt even see the millimeter when it fell
turned around saw gary stashing the heater in his belt
saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
i just sold two million records i dont need to go to jail
im not about to lose my freedom over no female
i need to slow down
try to get my feet on solid ground so for now

saying goodbye saying goodbye to hollywood
saying goodbye saying goodbye to hollywood
saying goodbye saying goodbye to hollywood

bury my face in comic books cause i dont wanna look
at nothing this worlds too much ive swallowed all i could
if i could swallow a bottle of tylenol i would
and end it for good just say goodbye to hollywood
i probably should these problems are piling all at once
cause everything that bothers me i got it bottled up
i think im bottoming out but im not about to give up
i gotta get up thank god i got a little girl
and im a responsible father so not a lot of good
id be to my daughter laying in the bottom of the mud
must be in my blood cause i dont know how i do it
all i know is i dont wanna follow in the footsteps
of my dad cause i hate him so bad
the worst fear that i had
was growing up to be like his fucking ass
man if you could understand why i am the way that i am
what do i say to my fans when i tell em im

saying goodbye saying goodbye to hollywood

this is not a game this fame in real life this is sick
publicity stunt my ass conceal my fucking dick
fuck the guns im done ill never look at gats
if i scrap ill scrap like i aint never whipped some ass
i love my fans but no one ever puts a grasp
on the fact ive sacrificed everything i have
i never dreamt id get to the level that im at
this is wack this is more than i ever coulda asked
everywhere i go a hat a sweater hood or mask
what about math how come i wasnt ever good at that
its like the boy in the bubble who never could adapt
im trapped if i could go back i never woulda rapped
i sold my soul to the devil ill never get it back
i just wanna leave this game with level head intact
imagine goin from bein a noone to seeing
everything blow up and all you did was just grow up emceeing
its fucking crazy cause all i wanted was to give hailie
the life i never had instead i forced us to live alienated so im saying

saying goodbye saying goodbye to hollywood

look i was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
but im only going to get this one chance
somethings wrong i can feel it
six minutes six minutes six minutes slim shady youre on
just a feeling ive got like somethings about to happen but i dont know what if that means what i think it means were in trouble big trouble and if he is as bananas as you say im not taking any chances
you are just what the doc ordered

im beginnin to feel like a rap god rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod back nod
now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box
they said i rap like a robot so call me rapbot

but for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
i got a laptop in my back pocket
my penll go off when i halfcock it
got a fat knot from that rap profit
made a livin and a killin off it
ever since bill clinton was still in office
with monica lewinsky feelin on his nutsack
im an mc still as honest
but as rude and as indecent as all hell
syllables skillaholic kill em all with
this flippity dippityhippity hiphop
you dont really wanna get into a pissin match
with this rappity brat packin a mac in the back of the ac
backpack rap crap yapyap yacketyyack
and at the exact same time i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while im practicin that
ill still be able to break a motherfuckin table
over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
only realized it was ironic i was signed to aftermath after the fact
how could i not blow all i do is drop fbombs
feel my wrath of attack
rappers are havin a rough time period heres a maxi pad
its actually disastrously bad for the wack
while im masterfully constructing this masterpiece

cause im beginnin to feel like a rap god rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod back nod
now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box
let me show you maintainin this shit aint that hard that hard
everybody want the key and the secret
to rap immortality like i have got

well to be truthful the blueprints
simply rage and youthful exuberance
everybody loves to root for a nuisance
hit the earth like an asteroid
did nothing but shoot for the moon since pew
mcs get taken to school with this music
cause i use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme
now i lead a new school full of students
me im a product of rakim
lakim shabazz twopac nwa cube hey doc ren
yella eazy thank you they got slim
inspired enough to one day grow up blow up and be in a position
to meet rundmc induct them
into the motherfuckin rock and roll hall of fame
even though ill walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
only hall of fame ill be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
on the wall of shame
you fags think its all a game till i walk a flock of flames
off a plank and tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin
little gaylookin boy
so gay i can barely say it with a straight face lookin boy
youre witnessin a massacre
like youre watching a church gathering take place lookin boy
oy vey that boys gaythats all they say lookin boy
you get a thumbs up pat on the back
and a way to go from your label every day lookin boy
hey lookin boy what you say lookin boy

get outta my face lookin boy
basically boy youre never gonna be capable
of keepin up with the same pace lookin boy cause

im beginnin to feel like a rap god rap god
all my people from the front to the back nod back nod
the way im racin around the track call me nascar nascar
dale earnhardt of the trailer park the white trash god
kneel before general zod
this planets kryptonno asgard asgard

so youll be thor and ill be odin
you rodent im omnipotent
let off then im reloadin
immediately with these bombs im totin
and i should not be woken
im the walkin dead but im just a talkin head a zombie floatin
but i got your mom deepthroatin
im out my ramen noodle
we have nothin in common poodle
im a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil
its me my honestys brutal
but its honestly futile if i dont utilize what i do though
for good at least once in a while
so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes
to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
but i gotta keep a few punchlines
just in case cause even you unsigned
rappers are hungry lookin at me like its lunchtime
i know there was a time where once i
was king of the underground
but i still rap like im on my pharoahe monch grind
so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine
appeal with the skin color of mine
you get too big and here they come tryin
to censor you like that one line
i said on im back from the mathers lp one when i
tried to say ill take seven kids from columbine
put em all in a line add an akfortyseven a revolver and a nine
see if i get away with it now that i aint as big as i was but im
morphin into an immortal comin through the portal
youre stuck in a time warp from two thousand and four though
and i dont know what the fuck that you rhyme for
youre pointless as rapunzel with fuckin cornrows
you write normal fuck being normal
and i just bought a new raygun from the future
just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad
cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweathers pad
singin to a man while they played piano
man oh man that was a two hundred and fortyseven special on the cable channel
so ray j went straight to the radio station
the very next day hey fab ima kill you
lyrics comin at you at supersonic speed jj fad
uh summalumma doomalumma you assumin im a human
what i gotta do to get it through to you im superhuman
innovative and im made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin off of me and itll glue to you and
im devastating more than ever demonstrating
how to give a motherfuckin audience a feeling like its levitating
never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting
for the day that they can say i fell off theyll be celebrating
cause i know the way to get em motivated
i make elevating music you make elevator music
oh hes too mainstream
well thats what they do when they get jealous they confuse it
its not hiphop its popcause i found a hella way to fuse it
with rock shock rap with doc
throw on lose yourself and make em lose it
i dont know how to make songs like that
i dont know what words to use
let me know when it occurs to you
while im rippin any one of these verses that versus you
its curtains im inadvertently hurtin you
how many verses i gotta murder to
prove that if you were half as nice
your songs you could sacrifice virgins to
ungh school flunky pill junkie
but look at the accolades these skills brung me
full of myself but still hungry
i bully myself cause i make me do what i put my mind to
and im a million leagues above you
ill when i speak in tongues but its still tongueincheek fuck you
im drunkso satan take the fucking wheel
ima sleep in the front seat
bumpin heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky
but in my head theres something i can feel tugging and struggling
angels fight with devils and heres what they want from me
theyre askin me to eliminate some of the women hate
but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
i have then you may be a little patient
and more sympathetic to the situation
and understand the discrimination
but fuck it lifes handin you lemons make lemonade then
but if i cant batter the women
how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then
dont mistake him for satan its a fatal mistake
if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation
to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and
dont be a retard be a king think not
why be a king when you can be a god


guess i got a way with words i could get away with murder
ever heard of aspergers its a rare condition
its what youre sufferin from when you simply dont care if its an
eighty degree day and theres no frickin air conditionin
and you cant see the bitchs hair is frizzin
cause you got the windows up blarin the system
in your chevrolet prizm
the devil aint on a level same as him
picture someone who revels in straight masochism
and imagine him givin an adjective an asswhoopin
so bad they should put his ass in prison
a word bully i verbally abuse verbs
like they did somethin to me personally
used to get bullied so id cut class and ditch it
now i bully rap im the shit faggot sniff it
cadillac from a k car
my ass from a hole in the ground still cant tell em apart
came straight out the trailer park
screamin im proud to shop at kmart and it became art
and im still fed up and as pissed off as they are
to this day i still get in fights with the same broad
at the same walmart arguin over the same cart
in the middle of the aisle whilin i dont give a fuck i dont play
bitch you think you saw this basket first
youre ass backwards like motherfuckin bob and silent jay
illest shit you could think i would say
minds like a pile of clay
whens the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
ripped a gapin hole in it flipped out
ripped down the drapes tied em around my neck
went down the fire escape of the empire state
slipped fell straight down to the ground
splattered all over the entire state
and straight to hell got impaled by the gates
saw satan stuck his face in an ashtray
while i sashayed around flames with a match
and i gave him the gas face
and this aint got nothin to do with a scale
or being gay little faggot but by the way
thoughts are gettin darker by the day
im a combination of skylar grey
tyler the creator and violent j
its a fuckin miracle to be this lyrical
paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face
im insane every rhyme i say
sons you like an ultraviolet ray
im sellin hatred buffet style all the shit you can eat
one thousand one hundred and ninetynine so come on and pile a plate
im throwin down the gauntlet to see what hell i can raise
with the rhyme im spittin while im shittin on competition
in the meantime its always mean time im gettin

ive been a career asshole
i dont see why these people always got my back
i done said so much fucked up shit
i was born a mistake but i was put here not by accident
i had a purpose and that purpose
was to beat a beat purplish slaughter tracks
i done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
im comin to get that quarter back
like ndamukong the drama can build
your mama can ask me for my autograph
cause that cougars a milf
shes the oldest trick in the book but i sure would fall for that
you done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
when i get on the mic ima snap
make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
when i overdosed woulda caught a flat
if it makes you sick to your stomach acid
indigestion my suggestions kaopectate
if it feels like im runnin away with the game
its cause i am dont speculate spectate
all i got is dick for days and insults for decades
but i get by with my wicked ways
lady you can suck a dick til your neck aches
cry til you get puffy eyes red faced
but im leavin on this jet plane
you aint fly youre an airhead
and im sick of poundin a square peg in a round hole
sorry another catchphrase
but your baggage aint gon fit in my storage overhead space
cause it just aint big enough to fit your damaged goods
other words dont try to put your heart in a headcase
cause baby stable mentally i aint
i need my meds i peed my bed
im going blind i dont see my legs i keep on falling down
no wonder you cant stand me i need my cane
someone help me i think my face is melting
if you felt these migraines
and see these maggots eat my brain
this giant hole in my empty head
if you read my mind you can see my pain
and youd see why i be this way
ever since i was kneehigh playin with gi joes
told these hoes shut their pie holes now peep my game
cause im bout it bout it
like a fuckin fuckin echo echo
psych psycho on a cyclone cycle spiralin here i go
im outta control like no other mic go
stab you til the knife goes  dull
im nothin but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
cause ima sock it to you
dyke ho you dont like it
get on your harley davidson menstrual cycle
and ride it like a motorbike
im finna blow the mic the whole night so
strike up the fuckin maestro im nitro
and hi ho hand me my shovel
im liable to dig my hole deeper
and its off to he double hockey sticks i go

ohh please be empty

and get my balls blew out and get gay into the am
and lay with eighteen guys naked
and let myself show let myself show
buttfuck it suck it pull it tug it
lifes too short to not stroke your bone
so everybody everybody
circle jerk touch my body
who is that where are you going come back
why does everyone always leave me
hello fuck you then
blow it out your ass


girl you give me writers block im at a loss for words
uhh my minds as lost as yours
i rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
never seen no ass as large as yours
how much that cost thats what i call a roethlissplurge
you drive me bonkers im about to get my swerve on for sure
thought i was pimpin til i felt like nas the first
date cause i think i gave you power
when i gave you flowers in a vase
a box of chocolates throat lozengers cough drops and certs
probably shoulda never let me call that job of yours
to talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
shoulda been one of the first signs to cause alert
man we jumped in too fast
cause since then i just cant be apart from her
cause nobodys bodys awesomer
i lust it and she loves me cause im popular
but you know this aint love

you know this aint love oh no
you know this aint love oh no
what is it then
its desperation shes looking for mr right
wants me to be that guy to her
its desperation i cant even put up a fight
cause i give in at the sight of her
and i here i go again

you were obviously oblivious to me
i swore i was just invisible to you
til i went to the lengths i did to meet you
cause you played so hard to get with me from
the beginning now im in disbelief i
never knew that this could be such misery ah
cause now you see nothing but me
and i dont see nothing but you
and im about to flip cause we are  super glued in
we stuck to each others hips and we cant
do anything individually which is to cling on
scared to be alone cant specifically describe it
i just cant seem to give a reason
thats definitive just need ya
talkin about i live and breathe ya
and you pretend to be as mentally and physically
addicted to me as wiz khalifa is to reefer
dont wanna be without you
dont wanna be with you neither
bitch put me in a situation in which its both i wish to seek
cause this aint love

you know this aint love oh no
you know this aint love oh no
what is it then
its desperation shes looking for mr right
wants me to be that guy to her
its desperation i cant even put up a fight
cause i give in at the sight of her
and i here i go again

just want you to myself
dont wanna share you with no one else
what the fuck you whisperin for
you get on my nerves you make me sick
i think our relationship it seems to be on the fritz
i mean its time that we just split and leave the
games behind your frame of mind aint the same as mine
i think you need to finish developing a
little more mentally to get the picture
thats a negative alicia i will never give the keys up
to the crib ever again no reason
not even a gift certificate from tiffanys
you better have an epiphany slut
guess what the lease up
im just mad the time it took to discover
you were usin me for loot like i used you for looks
oh thought you was too good for me huh
yeah toots used to be my carrie underwood
i was your lumberjack
but i cant stomach this im leavin you im not comin back
she said the fuck with that
wheres my louisville slugger at
she grabbed that fuckin bat
and swung it at my head i barely ducked and thats
right when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice
steel toe girl probably coulda put a one hundredyard field goal
through the uprights

you know this aint love oh no
you know this aint love oh no
what is it then
its desperation shes looking for mr right
wants me to be that guy to her
its desperation i cant even put up a fight
cause i give in at the sight of her
and i here i go again


i wanted the fame but not the cover of newsweek
oh well guess beggars cant be choosey
wanted to receive attention for my music
wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
for wantin my cake and eat it too and wantin it both ways
fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
when i blew see but it was confusing
cause all i wanted to dos be the bruce lee of loose leaf
abused ink used it as a tool when i blew steam
whoo hit the lottery oohwee
but with what i gave up to get it was bittersweet
it was like winnin a used mink
ironic cause i think im gettin so huge i need a shrink
im beginnin to lose sleep one sheep two sheep
goin coocoo and kooky as kool keith
but im actually weirder than you think cause im

now i aint much of a poet
but i know somebody once told me to seize the moment
and dont squander it cause you never know when it all
could be over tomorrow so i keep conjurin
sometimes i wonder where these thoughts spawn from
yeah ponderinll do you wonders no wonder
youre losin your mind the way it wanders
yodelodelayheehoo i think it went wanderin off down yonder
and stumbled onto jeff vanvonderen
cause i need an interventionist
to intervene between me and this monster
and save me from myself and all this conflict
cause the very thing that i loves killin me and i cant conquer it
my ocds conkin me in the head keep knockin
nobodys home im sleepwalkin
im just relayin what the voice in my heads sayin
dont shoot the messenger im just friends with the

call me crazy but i have this vision one day that
ill walk amongst you a regular civilian
but until then drums get killed and im comin straight at
mcs blood gets spilled and ill
take you back to the days that id get on a dre track
give every kid who got played that pumpedup feelin
and shit to say back to the kids who played him
i aint here to save the fuckin children but if one kid
out of a hundred million who are goin through
a struggle feels it and relates thats great
its payback russell wilson fallin way back
in the draft turn nothin into somethin
still can make that straw into gold chump
i will spin rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
maybe i need a straightjacket
face facts i am nuts for real but im okay with that
its nothin im still friends with the

im friends with the monster thats under my bed
get along with get along with the voices inside of my head
youre tryin to youre tryin to save me stop holdin your breath
and you think and you think im crazy yeah you think im crazy
well thats nothin


or eminem has a full line of chainsaws
eminem eminem eminem eminem eminem eminem
marshall mathers eminem the rapper eminem
who can say for sure perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer if science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use society would reap a great benefit

i walk around like a space cadet place your bets
whos likely to become a serial killer case of tourettes
fuck fuckfuck cant take the stress
i make a mess as the day progresses
angry and take it out on the neighbors hedges
like this is how ill cut your face up bitches
with these hedgetrimmin scissors with razor edges
imaginations dangerous
its the only way to escape this mess
and make the best of this situation i guess
cause i feel like a little bitch
this predicaments despicable im sick of just gettin pushed
its ridiculous i look like a frickin wuss
a pussy this kid just took my stick of licorice
and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
i wanna kick his tush but i was six and shook
this fucker was twelve and was six foot with a vicious hook
he hit me i fell i got back up all i did was book

fast forward some years later a teenager this is fun sweet
i just got jumped twice in one week its complete
its usually once a month this is some feat
ive accomplished theyve stomped me
into the mud gee for what reason you stumped me
but how do you get the shit beat out of you
beat down and be upbeat when you dont have nothing
no valid shot at life chance to make it or succeed
cause youre doomed from the start
its like you grew up on jump street from jump street
but if i could just get my head out my ass
i could accomplish any task practicin trashtalkin
in a trance locked in my room
yeah but i got some plans momma
these damn rhymes are falling out of my pants pocket
i cant stop it and im starting to blend in more
in school this shit helps for sure
im getting more selfassured than ive ever been before
plus no one picks on me anymore
i done put a stop to that threw my first punch  end of story
still in my skulls a vacant empty void
been usin it more as a bin for storage
take some inventory in this gourd theres a ford engine
door hinge syringe an orange
an extension cord and a ninja sword
not to mention four linchpins an astringent stored
ironin board a bench a wrench an oru
winch an attention whore
everything but a brain
but domes off the fuckin chain like an independent store

just think if i had a brain in it thank god that i dont
cause id probably be dahmer cause momma always said

if you had a brain youd be dangerous
a brain youd be dangerous
ima prove you wrong

somethings burnin i cant figure out what out what
its either lust or a cloud of dust
judgement is clouded must
just be the powder from the power of love
but im in something i dont know how to get out of
left my girl in the house alone
is that my soontobespouses moan
and the further i walk the louder
pause for a minute to make certain thats what i heard
cause after all this is her place
so i give her the benefit of the doubt i
think i might be about to bust her bust her
the thoughts scary yo though and it hurts  brace
hope it aint here we go yo
cause my head already goes to worstcase
scenario though in the first place
but you confirmed my lowend theory though
shouldve known when i made it all the way to third base
and that was only the first date
couldve made it to home plate
but you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
no slurp you dont slurp under slurp stand slurp
i slurp dont slurp do this for hic anyone hic ever slurp
yeah that aint what they all say
ill say you can suck a softball through a straw

she doesnt love me no she dont love me no more
she hates my company guess she dont love me no more
i tried to get her up out of my head left my bags at the door
she screamed she loved me like she never did before
and i told her go where you wanna
go do whatcha wanna do i dont care
and i told her go where you wanna
go do whatcha wanna do i dont care

so needless to say im feelin betrayed
snatch my house key off her key chain
she jumps off weebey from the wires dick
now shes chasin me with a cheese grater
here goes that broken record cliché
its all my fault anyway shes turnin the tables im a beatbreak
she treats my face like serato she cuts and scratches like a dj
each day is an instant replay
they say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
back together but forgot today was her bday
she cut me off on the freeway
simple misunderstanding but just as i went to slam on the brakes
thats when i realized that she may be crazy as me wait
bitch cut my fuckin brakeline
stepped on them fuckers eight times
still goin seventythree thank god theres an exit comin up
what the motherfucks wrong with her
hit the off ramp til i coasted to a goshdamn halt
hit a fuckin tree now here she comes at full speed
shes racin at me okay you wanna fuck with me eh
snatch that bitch out her car through the window
she screamin i body slam her on the cement
until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
buried the stink ho in it then paid to have the street repaved
the fuck woke up in a dream state
in a cold sweat like i got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
guess i eventually caved though cause shes layin next to me in bed  directly aimin a gat at my head
woke up again and jumped up
like fuck it ive had it im checkin into rehab
i confess im a static addict i guess thats why im so clingy
every girl ive ever had either says i got too much baggage
or im too fuckin dramatic
man what the fuck is the matter im just a fuckin romantic
i fuckin love you you fuckin bitch
combative possessive in fact last time i was mad at an ex
i actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
i said hit the road then after she left
i sent that bitch a text that said be careful driving
dont read this and have an accident
she glanced to look at it and wrecked car crashes
too bad thought we had a connect
no sense dwelling makes never been a more compelling case
than the model covered in loréal and mace
who fell from grace eleven stories for storytellin
while the whore was yellin rape
til her vocal cords were swellin
and her voice were more hoarser than tori spellings face
still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates
to greet norman bates with a warm embrace
less youre andrea yates dont ask me for a date though
youre late well the sentiments great
but wait think theres been a mistake
you wanted an intimate date i wanna intimidate
i have infinite hate in my blood
its mainly cause of the game of message sound
wait dinner at eight i have infinite hate in my blood
its mainly cause of the


i used to be the type of kid
that would always think the sky is fallin
why am i so differently wired am i a martian
what kind of twisted experiment am i involved in
cause i dont belong in this world
thats why im scoffin at authority defiant often
flyin off at the handle at my mom
no dad so i am noncompliant at home
at school im just shy and awkward
and i dont need no goddamn psychologist
tryna diagnose why i have all these underlyin problems
thinkin he can try and solve em
im outside chalkin up drawings
on the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin
to myself either that or inside hidin off in
the corner somewhere quiet tryin not to
be noticed cause im cryin and sobbin
i had a bad day at school so i aint talkin
some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin locker
cause he said that i eyeballed him

i used to be the type of kid that would always think the skys fallin
why am i so differently wired in my noggin
cause sporadic as my thoughts come its mindbogglin
cause i obsess on everything in my mind small shit
bothers me but not my father he said sayonara
then split but i dont give a shit
im fine long as theres batteries in my walkman
nothing is the matter with me
shit look on the bright side at least i aint walkin
i bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
complex on a tenspeed which ive acquired parts that
i find in the garbage a frame then put tires on it
headphones on look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
but if this is all there is for me life offers
why bother even tryin to put up a fight its nonsense
but i think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
what about them rhymes ive been jottin
they are kind of giving me confidence
instead of tryin to escape through my comics
why dont i just blast a little something like onyx
to put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
say what i wanna say to the kid that said that i eyeballed him
grab hold of my balls like thats right fights on bitch
who woulda knew from the moment i turned the mic on that
i could be iconic in my conquest
thats word to phife dawg from a tribe called quest

i used to be the type of kid that would always think the skys fallin
now i think the fact that im differently wireds awesome
cause if i wasnt i wouldnt be able to work words like this
and connect lines like crosswords
and use my enemys words as strength
to try and draw from and get inspired off em
cause all my life i was told and taught i am not shit
by you wack fuckin giant sacks of lyin dog shit
now you shut up bitch i am talkin
thought i was full of horseshit
and now you fuckin worship the ground on which i am walkin
me against the world so what im brian dawkins
versus the whole sixteen lions offense
so bring on the giants falcons and miami dolphins
its the body bag game bitch im supplyin coffins
cause you dicks butt kiss bunch of brian baldingers
youre gon die a ball licker ive been diabolical
with this dialogue since ninetynine rawkus
you dont respect the legacy i leave behind yall can
suck a dick the day you beat me pigsll fly out my ass
in a flyin saucer full of italian sausage
the most high exaltin and i aint haltin
til i die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes
the best part about me is i am not you
im me and im the fire marshall and this is my


i can feel the heat risin
everything is on fire
today is a painful reminder
of why we can only get brighter
the further you put it behind ya
but right now im on the inside
lookin out cause

yesterday was the tornado warning todays like the morning after
your world is torn in half you wake in its wake to start the
mourning process and rebuilding youre still a work in progress
todays a whole new chapter its like an enormous asthma
thunderstorm has passed ya you weathered it
and poked its eye out with the thorn bush that you used to smell the roses
stopped to inhale cant even tell your nose is
stuffed so focused on the bright side then you floor the gas pedal
and hit the corner faster more assertive never looking back
may hit the curb but every day is a new learning curve as you
steer through life sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have to
to avert a disaster lucky no permanent damage
cause they hurt you so bad its like they murdered your ass
and threw dirt on your casket but youve returned from the ashes
and that hurt that you have you just converted to gasoline
and while youre burning the past standing at inferno and chant

youre so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like
it happens all the time they take your heart and steal your life
and its as though you feel youve died cause youve been killed inside
but yet youre still alive which means you will survive
although today you may weep cause youre weakened
and everything seems so bleak and hopeless the light that youre seekin
it begins to seep in thats the only thing keepin
you from leapin off the mothafreakin deep end
and im pullin for you to push through this feeling
and with a little time that should do the healing and by tomorrow
you may even feel so good that youre willing to forgive em
even after all the shit you been put through this feeling of resilience is building
and the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building
youre sealed in but youre fireproof flame retardant you withstood it
and as you climb up to the roof youre just chillin you look down
cause youre so over em you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling

as time passes things change every day
but wounds wounds heal but scars still remaining the same
but tomorrow todays going down in flames
throw the match set the past ablaze

so feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even
perspire from the heat exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
and as you say goodbye to the grief its like watching the walls
melt in your prison cell but youve extinguished this livin hell
still a little piece of you dies as you scream


now this shits about to kick off this party looks wack
lets take it back to straight hiphop and start it from scratch
im bout to bloody this track up everybody get back

i went in headfirst never thinkin about who what i said hurt
in what verse my mom probably got it the worst
the brunt of it but as stubborn as we are did i take it too far
cleanin out my closet and all them other songs
but regardless i dont hate you cause ma
youre still beautiful to me cause youre my mom
though far be it from you to be calm
our house was vietnam desert storm
and both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
equivalent to chemical warfare
and forever we could drag this on and on
but agree to disagree that gift for me
up under the christmas tree dont mean shit to me
youre kickin me out its fifteen degrees
and its christmas eve little prick just leave
ma let me grab my fucking coat
anything to have each others goats
why we always at each others throats
especially when dad he fucked us both
were in the same fuckin boat
youd think thatd make us close nope
further away it drove us but together headlights shine
and a car full of belongings still got a ways to go
back to grandmas house its straight up the road
and i was the man of the house the oldest
so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
then nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
and thats when i realized you were sick
and it wasnt fixable or changeable
and to this day we remain estranged and i hate it though but

cause to this day we remain estranged and i hate it though
cause you aint even get to witness your grandbabies grow
but im sorry momma for cleanin out my closet
at the time i was angry rightfully maybe so
never meant that far to take it though
cause now i know its not your fault and im not makin jokes
that song i no longer play at shows
and i cringe every time its on the radio
and i think of nathan being placed in a home
and all the medicine you fed us and
how i just wanted you to taste your own
but now the medications takin over
and your mental states deterioratin slow
and im way too old to cry the shit is painful though
but ma i forgive you so does nathan yo
all you did all you said you did your best to raise us both
foster care that cross you bear few may be as heavy as yours
but i love you debbie mathers
oh what a tangled web we have cause
one thing i never asked was
where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
fuck it i guess he had trouble keepin up with every address
but ida flipped every mattress every rock and desert cactus
owned a collection of maps
and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
if someone ever moved em from me
that you coulda bet your asses
if i had to come down the chimney dressed as santa kidnap em
and although one has only met their grandma once
you pulled up in our drive one night
as we were leavin to get some hamburgers
me her and nate we introduced you hugged you
and as you left i had this overwhelming sadness
come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
i saw your headlights as i looked back
and im mad i didnt get the chance to
thank you for being my mom and my dad
so mom please accept this as a
tribute i wrote this on the jet i guess i had to
get this off my chest i hope i get the chance to
lay it fore im dead the stewardess said to fasten
my seatbelt i guess were crashin
so if im not dreamin i hope you get this message that
i will always love you from afar cause youre my mom


you used to say that id never be
nothin without you and id believe
im shot in the lungs i gasp i cant breathe
just lay here with me baby hold me please
and id beg and id plead drop to knees
and id cry and id scream baby please dont leave
snatch the keys from your hand i would squeeze
and youd laugh and youd tease
youre just fucking with me and you must hate me
why do you date me if you say i make you sick
and youve had enough of me
i smother you im bout to jump off the edge

but you wont break me
youll just make me stronger than i was
before i met you i bet you ill be just fine without you
and if i stumble i wont crumble
ill get back up and uhh
but ima still be humble when i scream fuck you
cause im stronger than i was

a beautiful face is all that you have
cause on the inside youre ugly and mad
but youre all that i love i grasp you cant leave
please stay here with me baby hold me please
and id beg and id plead drop to knees
and id cry and id scream baby please dont leave
but you left and you took everything i had left
and left nothin nothin for me
so please dont wake me from this dream baby
were still together in my head
and youre still in love with me
til i woke up to discover that that dream was dead

but you wont break me
youll just make me stronger than i was
before i met you i bet you ill be just fine without you
and if i stumble i wont crumble
ill get back up and uhh
but ima still be humble when i scream fuck you
cause im stronger than i was

you walked out i almost died
it was almost a homicide
that you caused cause i was so traumatized
felt like i was in for a long bus ride
id rather die than you not be by my side
cant count how many times i vomited cried
go to my room turn the radio on and hide
thought we were bonnie and clyde
nah on the inside you were jekyll and hyde
i felt like my whole relationship with you was a lie
it was you and i why did i think it was ride or die
cause if you coulda took my life you woulda
its like you put a knife through my chest
and pushed it right through to the
other side of my back and stuck a spike too shoulda
put up more of a fight but i couldnt
at the time no one could hurt me like you coulda
take you back now whats the likelihood of that
bite me bitch chew on a nineteen footer
cause this morning i finally stood up
held my chin up finally showed a sign of life in me for the
first time since you left
and left me with nothin but shattered dreams
and the life we coulda had and we coulda been
but im breakin out of this slump im in
pullin myself out of the dumps once again
im gettin up once and for all  fuck this shit
ima be late for the pity party
but youre never gonna beat me to the fuckin punch again
took it on the chin like a champ
so dont lump me in with them chumpions
im done bein your punching bag
it was the november thirtyonest today
woulda been our anniversary
two years but you left on the onest of may
i wrote it on a calendar was gonna call
but couldnt think of the words to say
but they came to me just now so i put em in a verse to lay

and i thank you cause you made me
a better person than i was
but i hate you cause you drained me
i gave you all you gave me none
but if you blame me youre crazy
and after all is said and done
im still angry yeah i may be
i may never trust someone

but you wont break me
youll just make me stronger than i was
before i met you i bet you ill be just fine without you
and if i stumble i wont crumble
ill get back up and uhh
but ima still be humble when i scream fuck you
cause im stronger than i was


part one produced by sone and mphazes

its like im in this dirt digging up old hurt
tried everything to get my mind off you it wont work
all it takes is one song on the radio youre
right back on it reminding me all over again
how you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
spent a lot of time tryin to soul search
maybe i needed to grow up a little first
well looks like i hit a growth spurt
but im coming for closure
dont suppose an explanation im owed for
the way that you turned your back on me
just when i may have needed you most
oh you thought it was over you could just close the
chapter and go about your life like it was nothing
you ruined mine but you seem to be doin fine
well ive never recovered
but tonight i bet you that what youre
bout to go throughs tougher than anything i ever have suffered
cant think of a better way to define poetic justice
can i hold grudges mind saying let it go fuck this
hearts saying i will once i bury this bitch alive
hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset

and to think i used to think you was the shit bitch
to think it was you at one time i worshipped shit
think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
not this time you better go and get the sewing kit bitch
finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew nitwit
thought some time would pass and id forget it forget it
you left our family in shambles
and you expect me to just get over him pretend he never existed
may be gone but hes not forgotten
and dont think cause hes been out the pictures
so long that ive stopped the plottin and still aint comin to get ya
youre wrong and that shit was rotten
and the way you played him same shit you did to me cold
have you any idea the shit that ive gone through
feelings i harbor all this pentup resentment i hold on to
not once you call to ask me how im doin
letters you dont respond to em
fuck it im coming to see you
and gee who better to talk to than you
the cause of my problems
my life is garbage and im bout to take it out on you
poof then im gone voosh

ive been drivin around your side of this town
like nine frickin hours and fortyfive minutes now
finally i found your new address park in your drive
feel like ive been waiting on this moment all of my life
and its now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva
my knife is out and im ducking on the side of your house
see its sad it came to this point
such a disappointment i had to make this appointment
to come and see ya but i aint here for your empathy
i dont need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
its revenge that i seek
so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
like i reached my full potential i peeked
continue to peep still bent low then keep
tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo sneak
all the way round to the back porch
man door handles unlocked shouldnt be that easy to do this
you dont plan for intruders beforehand
surprised to see me cat caught your tongue
gag chloroform rag dag almost hackup a lung
like you picked an axe up and swung stick to the core plan
dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
ironys spectacular huh now whos a faggot you punk
and heres your bronco hat
you can have that shit back cause they suck
its just me you and the music now slim i hope you hear it
were in the car right now  wait here comes my favorite lyric
im the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
and hey heres a sequel to my
mathers lp just to try to get people to buy
hows this for a publicity stunt this should be fun
last album now cause after this youll be officially done
eminem killed by m and m matthew mitchell
bitch i even have your initials
i initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it
since youre in love with your city so much i figured what the fuck
the best place you could be buried alive is right here
two more exits time is quite near
hope we dont get stopped no license i fear
that sirens i hear guess ninety on the freeway wasnt the brightest idea as cops appear in my drivers side mirror
oh god police aaaghh
hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least
new plan stan
slim chauvinist pig drove in this big lincoln town car
well gotta go almost at the bridge
ha ha big bro its for you slim this is for him
and frank ocean oh hope you can swim good
now say you hate homos again

part two produced by streetrunner

i also represent
anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
im the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
im your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
nope its hopeless im the denial that youre hopelessly in
when they say all of this is approachin its end
but you refuse to believe that its over here we go all over again
backs to the wall im stacking up all them odds
toilets clogged yeah cause im talking a lot of
shit but im backing it all up
but in my head theres a voice in the back and it hollers
after the track is demolished i am your lack of a conscience
im the ringing in your ears
im the polyps on the back of your tonsils
eatin your vocal chords after your concerts
im your time thats almost up that you havent acknowledged
grab for some water
but im that pill thats too jagged to swallow
im the bullies you hate that you became
with every faggot you slaughtered
coming back on you every woman you insult
batter but the doublestandards you have
when it comes to your daughters
i represent everything you take for granted
cause marshall mathers the rappers persona
is half a facade and matthew and stans just symbolic
of you not knowing what you had til its gone
cause after all the glitz and the glam
no more fans that are calling your name
cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them
im the hindsight to say i told you so
foreshadows of all the things that are to follow
im the future thats here to show you what happens tomorrow
if you dont stop after they call ya
biggest laughing stock of rap who cant call it quits
when its time to walk away im every guilt trip
the baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions
if theres anything you have left to say
less it makes an impact then dont bother
so fore you rest your case
better make sure youre packin a wallop
so one last time im back
before it fades into black and its all over
behold the final chapter in a saga
tryin to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
twice the magic that started
it all tragic portrait of an artist
tortured trapped in his own drawings
tap into thoughts blacker and darker
than anything imaginable here goes a wild stab in the dark
as we pick up where the last mathers left off


came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
an asshole that role i think i succeeded fulfillin
but dont think i ever stopped
to think that i was speaking to children
everything was happening so fast
it was like i blinkedsold three million
then it all went blank all i remember is feelin ridiculous
cause i was getting sick of this feelin
like i am always under attack man
i could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin
women dishin but really thinking if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this i would kill him
guess im a little bit of a hypocrite when im rippin shit
but since when did this many people ever give a shit
what i had to say its just my opinion
if it contradicts how im livin put a dick in your rear end
thats why every time you mentioned a lyric
i thanked you for it for drawing more attention toward it
cause it gave me an enormous platform
im flattered you thought i was that important
but you cant ignore the fact that i fought for the respect
and battled for it mad awards had glaad annoyed
attaboy they told me to slow down and i just zoned out
good luck tryin to convince a blonde
its like telling gwen stefani that she sold out
cause i was tryin to leave no doubt
in anyones mind one day id go down in history
think they know now because everybody knows

thanks for the support asshole scratch
thanks for the support asshole

quit actin salty i was countin on you to count me out
ask asher roth when he round about
dissed me to shout me out
thought i was history but goddamn honky
that compliments like backhanding a donkey
good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
nah im off him
but what the fuck is all this trashtalkin about
the fight was fixed im back and you cant stop me
you knocked me down i went down for the count
i fell but the fans caught me and now
youre gonna have to beat the fuckin pants off me
to take my beltword to pacquiao
momma said there aint nothin else to talk about
better go in that ring and knock em out
or you better not come out
its poetry in motion
like freddie roach when hes quotin shakespeare
so what if the insults are revoltin
even helen keller knows life stinks
you think its a joke til youre bulletriddled
but you should give little shit what i think
this whole world is a mess
gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest
and a glock just to go watch batman
who needs to test a testicles not that man
half of you dont got the guts and intestinal blockage
rest of you got lap bands
stuck to this motto before they put bath salts
and all those water bottles in colorado so get lost waldo
my souls escapin through this asshole that is gapin
a black hole and im swallowin this track whole
better pack toilet paper but im taking no crap ho
here i go down the bat pole
and im changing back into that old maniac
in fact there they go tryin to dip out the backdoor retreatin
cause everybody knows

holy mackerel im the biggest jerk on the planet earth
i smacked a girl off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
for thinkin we had some magnetic pull
then screamed icp in this bitch how do fuckin magnets work
cause youre attractive but we aint attractable
hate to be dramatical but im not romantical
im making up words you can understandable its tragical
thinkin some magical shits gonna happen that aint practical
you crackin a joke its laughable
cause me and loves like a bad combination
i keep them feelings locked in a vault
so its safe to say im uncrackable
my heart is truly guarded full body armor
bitch you just need a helmet
cause if you think youre special youre retarded
thinkin youre one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina
youre a train wreck i got a onetrack mind
shorty youre fine but you sort of remind me of a fortynineer
cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor
been tryna hunt me down like a dog
cause youre on my ass but you cant get a cent
cause all of my spare time is spent
on my nose in this binder so dont bother tryin
only women that i love are my daughters
but sometimes i rhyme and it sounds like i forget im a father
and i push it farther
so father forgive me if i forget to draw the line
its apparent i shouldnt have been a parent
ill never grow up so to hell with your parents
and motherfuckin father time
it aint never gonna stop a pessimist
who transformed to an optimist in his prime
so even if im halfdead im half alive
poured my half empty glass in a cup
so now my cup has runneth over
and im bout to set it on you like a mothafuckin coaster
im going back to what got me here
yeah cocky and cant knock being rude off so fear not my dear
and dry up your teardrops im here
white americas mirror so dont feel awkward or weird
if you stare at me and see yourself because youre one too
shouldnt be a shock because everybody knows


what is a nightmare
the dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream a nightmare

i used to think i had bad luck but i wasnt superstitious
til one day i grew suspicious
when i stepped on a crack on aunt ednas stoop
and got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
then we flew the coop to michigan to start anew but ditchin
missouri for michigan didnt work
so we moved back to missouri from michigan
from missouri back to michigan
someone put me out my misery i cant do this again
mom please stick to a decision
discipline last thing i wanna do is listen
shes like lex luthor bitchin her rules are kryptonite
so the walls i done lost my power to see through them bitches
but i run into em runnin through the kitchen
pretendin to be blind superman cause i had no supervision
but i did have a super power though i could turn into invisible kid
disappear out of sight like a true magician
and one day uncle ronnie brought over this new but different
music into the picture and it became my new religion

i remember it clearly even today

move back to michigan again to live with my grandma nan
always itchin for somethin to do was flippin
through the radio stations one day
and discovered this dj who was mixin
i say it to this day if you aint listened to the wizard
you aint have a fuckin clue what you was missin
id zone out with my headphones
all i remember doings wishin for shoes
fuck them stupid pumas bitch
its all about them new edition troops
you get them ll cool j coolin system
made that final manoeuvre to eight mile and hoover
and somehow i saw my future is in this
thats how i knew my mission
little boom box boomin spittin
practicin numerous writtens
when id sit in my room envisionin my dreams come to fruition
i remember proof would visit
couldnt wait to play him my new shit
hed go cuckoo ballistic go through the roof for his shit
its like we knew the instant
we touched a mic that both of us two existed
to do this shit never quit too persistent

carved an underground empire

started a group of misfits proof had a proposition
if we all band together there aint no stoppin this shit
come up with aliases bipolar opposites and
be ready to come off the top as sharp precision
if you got dissed at the shop cause if they caught you slippin
theyd take your spot if someone got to rippin
you and you forgot your written
opportunity knocks once it aint knockin again
it tried dingdong ditchin shit i fuckin got that bitch in
a headlock cut off its oxygen slim
is not budgin like cocksuckin cinder blocks in the wind
now i got a pot to piss in
spot in that top position koppin over the opposition
lookin like a dog thats pissin leg up on the competition
promisin complete dominance sugar ray robinson
im in a league muhammads in
alis my colleague bombin em
probably end up on top of em
stompin em like ndamukong
im russian like a ukrainian ladainian tomlinson
flow vomits in your face competitors fall at my waist
you spit a rhyme i spit in a rhymes face
so name the time place
to battle bitch im still in that mind state
dont make me step on you and make you wine grapes
cry babies maybe my way that i use words
is loose but you turds better be careful how you choose yours
cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse
and the truth hurts  shit no wonder youre sore losers
now wheres your poo birds
ooh no more trippin in bird shit
songs of selfempowerment surgin
words of encouragement but discouragin
the rappers the rap games god
but the names not james todd im just a wordsmith
so let these words lift
cause all i got is bars for you dumbbells
since yours aint workin out each verse is
more merciless than the first is
and you aint got to wear no shoes and shirt in this bitch
to get served bloodthirst revenge of the nerds chka

that youll not escape my vengeance

and im the kid with them ears like dumbos gone
word to uncle ron im turnin into a nonhumble don
you blonde dumb hoes all i got is dick for you to come blow on
so start the show but i need a drum roll fore i go on
better back away from the front row get launched
show you im bigger than dikembe mutumbo
on the fuckin jumbotron
im a juggernaut you do not wanna rumble you bomboclaats
ill leave you stretched out like a fuckin yawn
so mow the fuckin lawn your asses are blades of grass
and im fuckin up this whole landscape of rap
the goat just ate eight acres an eighth of that
was just to make a path
and take it straight to your favorite rapper
oh look my notebook looks smokecooked
like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove soot
charred debris floatin like oakwood
was burnin return of the no good and i wont quit

and the next thing i know
something came crawling up from below
something that made godzilla look like a blamed

and i dont quit wont change
its like a groundhogs day
so crowd around yall cause you may
see if i popped your head

im a monster mutt
ima turn into a monster
im a monster mutt
with my dick in your mouth all day

im not so sure i want to know from whence it came
but the white flesh creatures trail is easily followed
there before that shimmering veil of light the ivory skin slug thing


whats your name marshall
whos your daddy i dont have one

my mother reproduced like the komodo dragon
and had me on the back of a motorcycle then crashed in
the side of locomotive with rap im
loco its like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
bout to explode all over the canvas
back with the yoda of rap in a spasm
your music usually has em
but waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasnt
follow you must rick rubin my little padawan
a jedi in training colossal brain and
thoughts are entertainin
but docile and impossible to explain and im also vain and
probably find a way to complain about a picasso painting
puke skywalker but sound like chewbacca when i talk
full of such blind rage i need a seein eye dog
cant even find the page i was writing this rhyme on
oh its on the rampage
couldnt see what i wrote i write small
it says ever since i drove a seventynine lincoln with whitewalls
had a fire in my heart
and a dire desire to aspire to die hard
so as long as im on the clock punching this time card
hiphop aint dying on my watch

now sometimes when im sleepin
she comes to me in my dreams
is she taken is she mine
dont got time dont care dont have two shits to give
let me take you by the hand to promised land
and threaten everyone
cause theres no rhyme or no reason for nothing

now whats your name marshall
whos your daddy i dont know him but i wonder
is he rich like me ha
has he taken any time to show you what you need to live

no if he had
he wouldnt have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
i wouldnt be so mad my attitude wouldnt be so bad
yeah dad im the epitome and the prime
example of what happens when the power of the rhyme
falls into the wrong hands and
makes you want to get up and start dancin
even if it is charles manson
who just happens to be rappin blue lights flashin
laughin all the way to the bank lampin in my kmart mansion
im in the style department
with a pile in my cart rippin the aisle apart but
with great power comes
absolutely no responsibility for content
completely despondent and condescending
the king of nonsense and controversy is on a
beatkilling spree your honor
i must plead guilty cause i sparked a revolution
rebel without a cause who caused the evolution
of rap to take it to the next level boost it
but several rebuked it and whoever produced it
hiphop is the devils music
does that mean it belongs to me
cause i just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
that dont honk but every time i speak you hear a beep
but lyrically i never hear a peep not even a whisper
rappers better stay clear of me bitch cause its the

its the time of the season
when hate runs high
and this time i wont give it to you easy
when i take back whats mine
with pleasured hands
and torture everyone that is my plan
my job here isnt done
cause theres no rhyme or no reason for nothing

whats your name shady
whos your daddy i dont give a fuck but i wonder
is he rich like me doubt it ha
has he taken any time to show you what you need to live

so yeah dad lets walk
lets have us a father and son talk
but i bet we wouldnt probably get one block
without me knocking your block off this is all your fault
maybe thats why im so bananas i appealed to all those walks
of life whoever had strife
maybe thats what dad and son talks are like
cause i related to the struggles of young america
when their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
now theyre rippin out their fuckin hair again its hysterical
i chuckle as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
yeah uhoh better beware knuckle heads
the sign of my hustle says
dont knock the doors broken it wont lock
it might just fly open get coldcocked
you critics come to pay me a visit
misery loves company please stay a minute
kryptonite to a hypocrite
zip your lip if you dish it but cant take it
too busy gettin stoned in your glass house
to kick rocks then you wonder why i lash out
mr mathers as advertised on the flyers so spread the word
cause im promoting my passion until im passed out
completely braindead rain man
doing a bankhead in a restraint chair
so bitch shoot me a look it better be a blank stare
or get shanked in the pancreas
im angrier than all eight other reindeer
put together with chief keef cause i hate every fuckin thang yeah
even this rhyme bitch
and quit tryin look for a fuckin reason for it that aint there
but i still am a criminal
tenyearold degenerate grabbin on my genitals
the last mathers lp done went diamond
this time im predicting this one will go emerald
when will the madness end
how can it when theres no method to the pad and pen
the only message that i have to send
is dad im back at it again

yeah whos your daddy


yeah tryin to figure out the difference
but i think the lines are starting to get blurred

im in a strange place
i feel like mae when he gave up the game for his faith
i feel like im caged in these chains and restraints
grimmin every stranger in the place while i gaze into space
cause im mentally rearrangin his face
i need a change of pace
cause the pace im workin ats dangerous
theres nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
i done quit chicken heads cold turkey
and started slowly roastin em
cause thats where most of my anger is based
fuck your feelings i feel like i play for the saints
i just wanna hurt you  aim for the skanks
then aim for all these fake kanyes
jays waynes and the drakes
im frustrated cause aint no more nsync now im all out of whack
im all out of backstreet boys to call out and attack
im goin all out in this rap shit
and whatever the fallout is im strapped
for battle suckaduck crawl out the back
its a bar fight prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools
flyin through the air and bottles breakin mirrors also
and i aint stoppin til the swear jars full
you done called every woman a slut
but youre forgetting sarah marshall palin
oh my bad slut and next time i show up to court
ill be naked and just wear a law suit
judge be like thats sharp
how much did that motherfucker cost you
smartass youre lucky i dont tear it off you
and jump your bones you sexy motherfucker
youre so fuckin gravy marshall i should start callin you au jus
cause alls you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo
evil twin take this beat now its all you
i believe people can change but only for the worse
i coulda changed the world if it wasnt for this verse
so satanic kmart chains panic
cause they cant even spin back the curse words
cause theyre worse when theyre reversed motherfucker
rekcufrehtom rape your mother  tihs kill your parents
and these kids are like parrots
they run around the house just like terrorists
screamin fuck shit fuck adult with a childishlike arrogance
wild ever since the day i came out i was like merits
fuck that id rather be loud and i like swearin
from the first album even the gals were like tight lyrics
dreamy eyes but my fuckin mouth was nightmarish
and from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and
opposition felt the opposite sometimes i listen
and revisit them old albums often as i can and
skim through all them bitches
to make sure i keep up with my competition
haha hogger of beats hoarder of rhymes
borderline genius whos bored of his lines
and that sort of defines where im at and the way i feel now
feel like i might just strike first then ignore the replies

theres darkness closing in evil twin there it goes again my evil twin
it controls my pen my evil twin but that aint me its my evil twin
then i step out and see my evil twin he gives me an evil grin
but hes just a friend evil twin who pops up now and again evil twin
so dont blame me evil twin just blame him its my evil twin

jumped out of the twond floor of a record store
with a treacherous four cassette and a cassette recorder
in ecuador with edward norton
witness the metamorphosis
of a legend growin like an expert swordsman
from the hessian war and
hence the origin of the headless horseman
born with the endorphins of a pathetic orphan
endless source and reservoir
of extension cords in dresser drawers
and deadbolts on the bedroom doors
and sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin
excellent boyfriend

with women who have vendettas towards men
dickhead is forced in til theres shredded foreskin

i make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store
stegosaurus chuck norris with a thesaurus
yes of course a mess of warrants
you want some come and get some boys
im givin daniel pantaleo a refresher course
on excessive force and pressure points
and dressin george zimmerman in a fluorescent orange
dress and four inch heels to address the court
with a bullseye on his back his whole chest and torso
are left on the doorsteps of trayvons dad as a present for him

in my present form im desert storm
appetite for destruction theres no suppressant for
aggressive forceful and less remorseful in every morsel
unpleasant horrible hello gorgeous

stacey dashs and casey anthonys
crazy asses in the backseat

dead passenger in the passenger seat
unfasten the safety latches
and slam on the brakes in traffic so hard

diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen
and never appear again

way before my baby daughter hailie
i was harassed daily by this fat kid named deangelo bailey
an eighth grader who acted obnoxious cause his father boxes
so every day hed shove me in the lockers
one day he came in the bathroom while i was pissin
and had me in the position to beat me into submission
he banged my head against the urinal til he broke my nose
soaked my clothes in blood grabbed me and choked my throat
i tried to plead and tell him we shouldnt beef
but he just wouldnt leave
he kept chokin me and i couldnt breathe
he looked at me and said you gonna die honky
the principal walked in and started helpin him stomp me
whats going on in here
i made em think they beat me to death
holdin my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
then i got up and ran to the janitors storage booth
kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the fourinch screws
grabbed some sharp objects brooms and foreign tools
this is for every time you took my orange juice
or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
im gettin you back bully now once and for good
i cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as i could
and beat him over the head with it til i broke the wood
knocked him down stood on his chest with one foot
made it home later that same day
started readin a comic and suddenly everything became gray
i couldnt even see what i was tryin to read
i went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
my mother started screamin what are you on drugs
look at you youre gettin blood all over my rug im sorry
she beat me over the head with the remote control
opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
i picked it up and screamed look bitch what have you done
oh my god im sorry son
shut up you cunt
i said fuck it took it and stuck it back up in my head
then i sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

brain damage ever since the day i was born
drugs is what they used to say i was on
they say i never knew which way i was goin
but everywhere i go they keep playin my song

i dont speak i float in the air wrapped in a sheet
im not a real person im a ghost trapped in a beat
i translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
and the noise is spread
picked up and transmitted through royces head uhh
trap him in his room possess him and hoist his bed
til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
told him each one of his boys is dead ohh
i asked him to come to the dark side
he made a choice and said yo
who hard yo i done heard worse
we can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
to see which onell swerve first
two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity
holds that of a globe on top of nine other planets
kissed the cheek of the devil intelligence level
is hellier than treble peakin on speakers in the ghetto
dismissal im not a fair man disgraced the race of an atheist
interceptin missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
one track sliced without swords i buried the christ corpse
in my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse
and stay overworked its like the nazis and the nation
collaboratin attemptin to take over the earth

cause this is what happens when bad meets evil
we hit the trees til we look like vietnamese people
hes evil and im bad like steve seagal
above the law cause i dont agree with police either
shit me neither

we aint eager to be legal
so please leave me with the keys to your jeep eagle
i breathe ether in three lethal amounts
while i stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle ahh
releasin rage on anybody in squeezin range
cold enough to make the seasons change into freezin rain
hes insane no im not i just want to shoot up
and im pissed off cause i cant find a decent vein
the disaster with dreads im bad enough to commit suicide
and survive long enough to kill my soul after im dead
when in danger its funny actually my flavors similar to a waiter
cause i serve any stranger with money
i spray a hundred man until they joint chains
while slippin bullets at pointblank range like they was punches
piss on a flag and burn it murder you then come to your funeral
service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
whippin human ass throwin blows crackin jaws
with my fists wrapped in gauze dipped in glue and glass
im blazin emcees at the same time amazin emcees

to cast a avalanche and bust til volcanoes erupt

life by marshall mathers
what is life
life is like a big obstacle in front of your optical to slow you down
and every time you think youve gotten past it
its gonna come back around to tackle you to the damn ground
what are friends
friends are people that you think are your friends
but they really your enemies with secret identities
and disguises to hide they true colors
so just when you think you close enough to be brothers
they wanna come back and cut your throat when you aint lookin
what is money
money is what makes a man act funny
money is the root of all evil
moneyll make them same friends come back around
swearin that they was always down
what is life im tired of life

im tired of backstabbinass snakes with friendly grins
im tired of committin so many sins
tired of always givin in when this bottle of henny wins
tired of never havin any ends
tired of havin skinny friends hooked on crack and mini thins
im tired of this dj playin your shit when he spins
tired of not havin a deal
tired of havin to deal with the bullshit without grabbin the steel
tired of drownin in my sorrow
tired of havin to borrow a dollar for gas to start my monte carlo
im tired of motherfuckers sprayin shit and dartin off
im tired of jobs startin off
at five hundred and fifty an hour then this boss wonders why im smartin off
im tired of bein fired every time i fart and cough
tired of havin to work as a gas station clerk
for this jerk breathin down my neck drivin me berserk
im tired of usin plastic silverware
tired of workin at builders square
tired of not bein a millionaire

but if i had a million dollars
id buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
if i had a magic wand
id make the world suck my dick without a condom on
while im on the john
if i had a million bucks it wouldnt be enough
because id still be out robbin armored trucks
if i had one wish i would ask
for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss

im tired of bein white trash broke and always poor
tired of takin pop bottles back to the party store
im tired of not havin a phone
tired of not havin a home to have one in if i did have one on
tired of not drivin a bm
tired of not workin at gm tired of wantin to be him
tired of not sleepin without a tylenol pm
tired of not performin in a packed coliseum
tired of not bein on tour
tired of fuckin the same blonde whore
after work in the back of a contour
im tired of fakin knots with a stack of ones
havin a lack of funds and resortin back to guns
tired of bein stared at
tired of wearin the same damn nike air hat
tired of steppin in clubs wearin the same pair of lugz
tired of people sayin theyre tired of hearin me rap about drugs
tired of other rappers who aint bringin half the skill as me
sayin they wasnt feelin me on nobodys as ill as me
and im tired of radio stations tellin fibs
tired of jlb sayin where hiphop lives

but if i had a million dollars
id buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
if i had a magic wand
id make the world suck my dick without a condom on
while im on the john

ayo this song is dedicated
to all the happy people
all the happy people who have real nice lives
and have no idea what its like to be broke as fuck

i feel like im walkin a tight rope without a circus net
poppin percocet im a nervous wreck
i deserve respect but i work a sweat for this worthless check
im bout to burst this tec at somebody to reverse this debt
minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
full of venom and rage specially when im engaged
and my daughters down to her last diaper its got my ass hyper
i pray that god answers maybe ill ask nicer
watchin ballers while they flossin in they pathfinders
these overnight stars becomin autographsigners
we all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
along with the small fries and average halfpinters
but playerhaters turnin bitch like they have vaginas
cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
moneyll brainwash you and leave yo ass mindless
them snakes slither in the grass spineless

thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill
thats rock bottom when you want somethin bad enough to steal
thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here
cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill
thats rock bottom when you want somethin bad enough to steal
thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here
cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

my life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
im hopin things look up but there aint no job openings
i feel discouraged hungry and malnourished
livin in this house with no furnace unfurnished
and im sick of workin deadend jobs with lame pay
and im tired of bein hired and fired the same day
but fuck it if you know the rules to the game play
cause when we die we know we all goin the same way
cause its cool to be the player but it sucks to be the fan
when all you need is bucks to be the man plus a luxury sedan
or comfortable and roomy in a six
but they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
who walk around depressed and smoke a pound of cess a day
and yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today
my daughter wants to throw the ball but im too stressed to play
live half my life and throw the rest away

thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill
thats rock bottom when you want somethin bad enough to steal
thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here
cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill
thats rock bottom when you want somethin bad enough to steal
thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here
cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

theres people that love me and people that hate me yup
but its the evil that made me
this backstabbin deceitful and shady mhm
i want the money the women the fortune and fame
that means i end up burnin in hell scorchin in flame
that means im stealin your checkbook and forgin your name
this lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
cause right now i feel like ive just hit the rock bottom
ive got problems now everybody on my blocks got em duh
im screamin like them two cops when twopac shot em
holdin two glocks hope your doors got new locks on em
my daughters feet aint got no shoes or socks on em
and them rings you wearin look like they got a few rocks on em
and while you flaunt em
i could be takin em to shops to pawn em
i got a couple of rings and a brandnew watch you want em
cause i aint never went gold off one song
im runnin up on someones lawn with guns drawn

thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill
thats rock bottom when you want somethin bad enough to steal
thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here
cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill
thats rock bottom when you want somethin bad enough to steal
thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here
cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear
thats rock bottom
