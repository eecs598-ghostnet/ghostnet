naked bitches really love ones
sometimes our loved ones dont love us
im fuckin more than im makin love
sometimes i make my rubber wear a rubber
i just tell my lady nothings easy
even though i make it look easy
but understand looks are deceiving
lookin like im lookin for some grievance
cause i been through way too much dont wanna think about it
cranky bout it gotta drink about it
gotta synchronize it tranquilize it
doctor aint prescribin what he aint realizin
pain inside me got me thinkin bout me
tryna hang my body sanctifyin
im a gangsta dyin cause all gangsters die
i cant deny it you cant tame my lion
im a angry lion hangin by a string
i cant describe it
feel like a anchor tied to my finger
got me sinkin to the bottom of my drink
i know a lotta niggas think i got a lotta niggas
theres strength in numbers but theres honor over strength
i talked to god the other day he say he got a nigga
so i look death up in her eye and then i wink
its way too real
the shit im talkin way way too real
i hope it gave you chills
the dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
you dont know how dead you feel til youre dead for real
gettin high after i paid the bill
lower than a navy seal
show up with them navy guns
i hope somebody prayin for em
price tag no mistake somebody payin for em
ice bath when my face numb no expression
whats the life expectancy when you dont expect shit
mama told me fuck the world and be so aggressive be so fluorescent watch these hoes cause they so obsessive
i dont get too high to look over blessings
never come in second make the most of your seconds
they so precious
cause if we could buy time every store would sell it
if you want me to read your mind need correct spelling
i keep it real niggas better keep it copacetic
where the weed i feel like im gettin a sober headache
lookin in the mirror at the one that know me better
i was too busy to talk i wrote an open letter

dear life

is when your welcome is worn
and now her temperatures showin
and i just weather her storm
and she expect me to stay
