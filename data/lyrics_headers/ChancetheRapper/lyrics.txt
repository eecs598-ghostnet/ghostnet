i aint no activist im the protagonist
i dont cocaptain it i fly solo like one cup in the cabinet
the cab is the cabinet they trust me at landing it
they call me the advocate theyll slide like the abacus
boy meets world everybody been savages
i just want to really know how much that your shooter averages
im not no nice guy im just the good guy
the bad guys should really stay on my good side
i smelled my roses younger than the good die
the illuminati couldnt see me with they good eye
they think they heath ledger scary they just jack nichols
im a sign to my city like the batsignal
young chosen one golden boy de la hoya
it aint too many mes rest in peace to verne troyer
i was younger than i seemed as a kid
i mean my gseventeen eighteen in the head
i mean im only twentyfive but im motown twentyfive
bet i get a statue in my hometown when i die
and rahm you done im expectin resignation
an open investigation on all of these paid vacations for murderers

fuck you ohoh

i dont get no paper i gotta sign at the bottom
still in my bag like the fries at the bottom
and i cant do nothing right they gon always be at me
i missed a crains interview they tried leaking my addy
i donate to the schools next they call me a deadbeat daddy
the suntimes gettin that rauner business
i got a hitlist so long i dont know how to finish
i bought the chicagoist just to run you racist bitches out of business
speaking of racist fuck your microaggressions
ill make you fix your words like a typo suggestion
pat me on the back too hard and patll ask for your job
and in unrelated news someonell beat your ass at your job
im the real deal
who taught all these rappers that a big deals not a big deal
inherited the earth popping wheelies on a big wheel
my enemy lives in his mothers basement
thats why my videos dont got no baphomet product placement
im a real one
the honey is sweet the apples bitter
theyll try to convince you you stronger without your woman than when you with her
and tell you they kidding while twitter trashing your litter
i know the devils a liar
i know that players is quitters i heard you hire your hitters
i know the higher the bidder that mean the less on return
so i just hire a sitter
im not no boss nigga im a soldier
kingdom builder man somebody shoulda told ya
fuck you


what to get the man who has everything
tryna fit myself into a schedule and a wedding ring
tryna eat everything
i was raised it come across my plate then i better swing
tryna turn confederate flags into confetti strings
im tryna back up my baby mama like kevin federline
heard they got some niceass houses out there in beverly
never leave where i came from
i just need me some stockings and the chimney they could hang from
photos so my kids can find out where they got their names from
christmas cards so gorgeous other families wanna frame one
real talk i need a front yard a backyard
a side yard a side yard inside bar a dry bar
nine cars and a garage and its on hella acres
im tired of people visitin takin the elevator
well well keep the elevator

love me forever thats all i ask of you
love me forever thats all i ask of you

dont gifts get rewrapped
that shit could get sticky like tree sap
i gave you free raps that shit sound like free facts
which is bout as common as free blacks
stuck like freeze tag from one of these random police stops
look like the treetops soon as the breeze stops
and once the debris drops the streets four hundred degrees hot
please man we needin some freeze pops
what in the world for the man who has everything
man west chatham park could use some better swings
used to be disheveled i went and shoveled everything
tell santa to show up to doors he never ring
he never ring

love me forever thats all i ask of you
thats all i ask
love me forever thats all i ask of you

that baby is a genius
dont teach him bout santa til you teach him bout jesus
dont take him out the snow to try to take him on beaches
i swear its enough leisure in this world to get lost
whats the point of gainin chicken if you lose all the sauce
whats the point of gainin chicken if it cant get across
lost the cold hard cash they said damn that boy soft
same niggas lost their souls in a fuckin coin toss
i guess i cleaned up santa dont miss no names but i miss fatimah
its been a minute since ive seen her
them the type of things i hate to bring up just like the prenup
that shit be seethrough like john cena aquafina
but like the christmas tape theres things that i gotta get clear
like my papa ask the same question every year
what to get for my boy who has everything
i said ill take anything but everything you know

love me forever thats all i ask of you
love me forever thats all i ask of you
love me forever thats all i ask of you
love me forever thats all i ask of you


i could spare a rib to get my baby back
i just wanna fall asleep where my baby at
so i dont wake up wondering where my baby at
i wonder if well make it back
i wonder can i pay her back please
sixtyfiveth and ingleside
way before jamie got his jingles right
i was sleeping with you every single night
but i was still tryna act single right
sixtyfiveth and ingleside
i was stacking chips like bingo night
i didnt have to pay for a single light
so ima make sure everything go right

your sister owned the house we lived in
on the east side that you rented
little two flat inexpensive
i didnt have a glove to pitch in
i didnt have a pot to piss in
not to mention in dro city
not a lot of jobs with pensions
all my raps was bout suspension
then one day donald took me on tour
young broke chano aint broke no more
thought you wouldnt want me come and darken your doorstep
but i still havent given you whats yours yet
sixtyfiveth and ingleside
moved downtown for a single life
none of my stars ever twinkled bright
til god decide to come bring you by

wheres the return on investment my first ar
that shit was played unless you would hit play in the car
we hit the shell station i tell you stay in the car
back in the spot dont put it in park
leave that bitch running in case i come running
and skrrt skrrt skrrt skrrt skrrt skrrt grab the gold scar
there it get late fore its dark
kensli couldnt play in the park
now she could play in the stars
high rise eye to eye with fireworks
so high your ears fire they mightve burst
every time they buy a verse i buy a purse
but you cant buy back time thats just not how it works
three jobs you afforded the crib
fuck child support you supported the kid
a full rack a month nothing short of my rib
so you first up go in order of dibs
my big homie told me nigga growth and development
go and settle down dont settle for settlement
she got you closer to god than you two ever been
she moved over from evanston you moved over from eggleston
first lady you knew you cant marry her
got shit sonny now you cant share
new dad step in you cant stare
you knew the power in the woman that could lead you in prayer
on sixtyfiveth and ingleside
feel like you remember every single lie
truth is i just really need your finger size
so i can make sure that they make the ring so tight


the first is that god is better than the worlds best thing
god is better than the best thing that the world has to offer


part one finish line


may the lord give your journey mercy
may you be successful grant you favor
and bring you back safely i love you


we dont do the same drugs no more
we dont do the we dont do the same drugs do the same drugs no more
cause she dont do the same drugs no more
we dont do the we dont do the same drugs do the same drugs no more

when did you change
wendy youve aged
i thought youd never grow up

a shadow of what i once was

cause we dont do the same drugs no more
we dont do the we dont do the same drugs do the same drugs no more
she dont laugh the same way no more
we dont do the we dont do the same drugs do the same drugs no more

where did you go
why would you stay
you must have lost your marbles
you always were so forgetful
in a hurry dont wait up
i was too late i was too late
a shadow of what i once was
cause we dont we dont do what we say were gonna
you were always perfect and i was only practice
dont you miss the days stranger
dont you miss the days
dont you miss the danger
