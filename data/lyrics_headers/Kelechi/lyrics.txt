guess i never considered how scary it gets
how you tearing out my locs and putting dread in my head

blowing it all when we coulda gone on our separate ways
knowing i wouldnt hit you you still swinging on me
thats a far cry from what you was telling me yesterday

maybe i coulda fixed it
maybe have been convinced
but you threw it all away when you threw that first right

how does it feel
lately i been getting angry losing temper lashing out
i been coming up on realizations
what if rapping was big mistake and
i was supposed to stay in school and finish with a cap and gown
you made some money off of pepsi nigga what you mad about
how does it feel
how you think it feel when you done went from fucking blowing stacks
to all ya business bank accounts in overdraft
this aint what we dreamed about in culdesacs
while everyone around you treat your pockets like theyre goldman sachs
and you dont wanna be the one to let your momma know its bad
how does it feel
im feeling like my patience wearing thin
waiting on a good samaritan
tryna hang around the money trees
but niggas always getting merrill lynched
feeling like a nigga never wins
when shit was lit as it had ever been
maybe i shoulda been more grateful
how does it feel
how it feel when niggas steal ya laptop and ya album
and you aint making any income nigga whats the outcome
crying at a busted car window god how come
how come

chorus
how does it feel how does it feel
how do it feel how do it feel
how do it feel how do it feel when shit get real
yeah yeah

niggas switchin cause they hopping off and on the bandwagon
police aiming at my niggas all because their pants saggin
running all up in your momma crib and then they ransack it
just so they can find a couple nuggets and some damn baggies
how does it feel
how it feel when your girl late
and you just wanna tell the world wait
but you aint moving at the worlds pace
so you hit the block and you hurl weight
youre doing wrong for the right things
you look at god at the pearl gates like i tried
how does it feel
how you feeling when youre twentytwo
and you aint know ing what you wanna do
you hated what you studied up in school
but you live your life following the rules
aint no one knowing what youre going through
till twelve found your body in a room
with a self inflicted bullet wound
how does it feel
when you find out its more to life
than tryna live it like youre sorta right
by making millions fore youre forty five
up and down like a quarter pipe
fifty fifty on the borderline
between peace and starting up a riot
just a crisis in your quarter life

how does it


ask if we run the block
ask if the sun is hot
ask if the biggest dogs turn to pussy cats when they run from cops
ask where the evidence a one hundredk in cash and a ton of rock

that low fade dont you braid your hair in plaits like them
wait im a naija boy i told you i aint black like them
the police rolled up on me put me in the back like them
why
cause im a

law abiding car riding scared of police
maybe cause our brothers dead in the streets
what you saying to me

still momma taught me be prepared for the heat

take off hoodie
all green i see low but my mob goodie
mumbles
lights in our faces but couldnt see through the dark could he
black male
black questions
black answers

july sun burnt blacks skin
black cancer
black coal in good black stockings
ask santa
touch your roots and have black thoughts

my intentions

well
honestly im just tryna fuck and cuddle with something soft right after i bust a nut
and i aint runnin game when i ask you to huddle up
but im still way too in love to be fallin in more than lust and ugh
i dont mean to be long winded but i broke my own heart
cause im stupid and we long distance
i tried to fix it with some long visits
but now im tryna get you right and i hope you see nothin wrong with it
and plus i got my own emotional baggage because my papas a rolling stone and he made it a habit
my mama stayed for the kids and for that i feel kinda bad
and so now i give out the type of love that i wish he was havin
and he wrong for his wrongs but i think i know why
my daddys daddy was a king chief and he had four wives
it made me reanalyze the reason we had our lives
but you asked me a question and thats the reason i swiped right

i aint really shit right now no i aint shit but yeah thats why i swiped right
i really cant commit right now no i admit
but i really wanna lay you down slow if you fine with it
but i aint really shit right now no i aint shit
woo woo
i aint really shit right now no i aint shit
i really cant commit right now no i admit
but i really wanna lay you down slow if you fine with it
but i aint really shit right now no i aint shit
i aint shit yeah

yeah i okay i know that was a lot
i know you wow you didnt really ask me all that
but you asked me what my intentions were i asked i asked and
i figured if im gonna give you intentions i should i should yeah
totally give you the no no no reasons behind the intentions
just shut up shut up shut up yeah
okay
just let me talk

woo
so my daddy hit my mama and i never told ya honor
so when my nigga beat me i just figured it was karma
i used to justify it like he couldt hit me harder
til i woke up at the hospital they thought i was a goner
they put me in a hot seat it felt just like a sauna
they asked if i would press a charge and i aint really wanna
started blowin mary jay because i aint want no more drama
and its easier to smoke it all than cope with all the trauma
i hate that we was everything i wanted us to be
and then they came and locked him up before i was strong enough to leave
and i aint gonna hold ya i aint really got closure
and im only tellin you because its honor amongst the thieves
and i know my mama loved my daddy more than she was scared of him
she just knew his foster parents they were never fair to him
knowin that might just make this a little less embarrassin
i fuck niggas on tinder cause i cant afford a therapist

i aint really shit right now no this is a really unhealthy coping mechanism i know but i aint shit
i really cant commit right now no youre not the only one of us thats kinda fucked up i admit
but i really wanna lay you down slow if you fine with it
but i aint really shit right now no i aint shit
woo woo
i aint really shit right now no i aint shit
i really cant commit right now no i admit
but i really wanna lay you down slow if you fine with it
but i aint really shit right now no i aint shit
i aint shit yeah

so there you go you have like my whole story or whatever so we can just cut the nice guy act and we can just go back to your place right now
actually ugh actually its your turn to shut up okay and ugh
how bout we we get another round how bout that
well cool yeah yeah thats cool
lets talk

i aint really shit right now no i aint shit
i really cant commit right now no i admit
but i really wanna lay you down slow if you fine with it
but i aint really shit right now no i aint shit

my immigrant son my immigrant son
this battle called life our spirit is one
so raise up both flags victorious one
my immigrant son my immigrant son
my immigrant child you immigrant child
you race with both races this road goes for miles
you cant serve two masters but you have two homes
my immigrant son
my immigrant son
my immigrant son

strange growing up i was ashamed
house smelling like fufu kid with the funny name
i was outcast by the outcast
i guess i was lamer than lame
african clothes on picture day wait hold up let me explain
cause i aint fit in with the sallys and i aint fit in with the johns
and i aint fit in with the keishas and i fit in with daquan
i was too black for the white kids too african for the black
too american for my parents friends so what was i to do with that
all i could do was attack
and fit in wherever they let me
but kmart never had bicycle license plates with the name kelechi
so i tried hard to impress these
kids who would never get me
and accept these substitute teachers would never say my name correctly
on dry land on a jetski
a fish out of water
well lets be honest
i was a real african american the definition of mixed breed
so miss me
with that african booty scratcher im an african prince
counting this paper like folding a cootie catcher want to know what passionate is
my bars are like the stars and stripes
painted over green and white
naija blood is in my veins from my mothers love to my fathers might
and we arent alike cause im igbo
meaning i got a big ego
one time for the super eagles
two times for my naija people
the american dreams our parents have seen through me are becoming legitimate
an immigrant son from the the mother land but lady liberty is the surrogate
and we going after every single thing they told our parents they would never get
im nigerian im american
not bad for some immigrant sons

my immigrant son my immigrant son
this battle called life our spirit is one
so raise up both flags victorious one
my immigrant son my immigrant son
my immigrant child you immigrant child
you race with both races this road goes for miles
you cant serve two masters but you have two homes
my immigrant son
my immigrant son
my immigrant son

of your ship and promise when you make it make shit happen

its ironic how empty threats make you full of shit
its ironic how someones missed when a bullet hits
its ironic how old slaves push the newest whips
its ironic right
oh lord knows life on earth aint long enough
for me to right everything wrong with with us
or make everybody hate and fall in love
im so low hydro aint strong enough
so you could never hit the ball enough
for long enough
to get up in the zone with us
so pour it up and toast it up and sing a song with us
so we say
dont make up where you been
dont make no art for free
dont make do with the average
dont make off like a thief
is this me rapping to you
or god talking to me
dont make a million bucks if you cant make no time for me
dont make up where you been
dont make no art for free
dont make do with the average
dont make a mockery
is this me rapping to you
or god talking to me
dont make a thousand racks if you cant make no time for me

dont shame your fathers name
dont stop your mothers laughing
dont take your girl for granted
dont make these hoes a habit
dont make your brothers friends
dont make your haters captains
of your ship and promise when you make it make shit happen

some advice for life
lend me your ear this a tyson fight
visionary eyes its like im cyclops mines are twice as bright
yall be on that bullshit bison
my drive like my license right
bob barker if you sell your soul ask me if the price is right
finding out im a kid took some growing up
its a showdown whenever im showing up
eyelids go down whenever im pouring up
i got smart to realize i dont know enough
its a moment at four in the morn when you know its all gone all shut down less you open up
woke up like folgers with boulders off shoulders
let go of the fixes fore they leave you broken up

dont shame your fathers name
dont stop your mothers laughing
dont take your girl for granted
dont make these hoes a habit
dont make your brothers friends
dont make your haters captains
of your ship and promise when you make it make shit happen

thirteen never told twentythree youre gonna be like this
like this
he lied to me he lied to me oh oooh
so if you look at history feeling like your generations gonna rewrite this
write this
then ride with me ride with me oh ooh
then ride with me ride with me oh ooh
then ride with me ride with me oh ooh
then ride with me ride with me oh ooh
ride with me now ride with me now

when i was thirteen i thought id be twentythree with a money tree
michael jordan stats whenever im recording raps
and now im in the mirror nowhere near where i wanna be
they say be patient yeah the hare told the tortoise that
weekend with the team throwed like the quarter back
bucks haveem all on your sack like warren sapp
them hoes get delivered to your door like you ordered that
only bout a matter of time before youre bored with that
dreads getting longer temper getting shorter
burden of success and her legs on your shoulders
she sayin be quick cause her friends coming over
so she pulled the thong over like a cop meeting quota
they say im getting vulgar i just think im getting older
or maybe its the slope that im slipping like a loafer
try to crucify my ts treat my is like a polka
but the truth is still the truth whether youre faded or youre sober
kelechi young naija unamerican idol
if you kill your old self is that considered homicidal
im ashamed throwing shade like where the hell did your life go
open condom wrapper next to an unopened bible
would you from ten years ago be proud of you now
would he say hes seeing that potential outta you now
or would he lie to you now
and say you shoulda graduated not to mention aint no record labels signing you
i think my best friends dont get me
they dont see it coming like a wet dream
sometimes i think that gods tryna test me
but its still stndrd overall thats the best team
eggs in one basket gets gritty but its gravy
in the scope of greatness but the aftermath is shady
ten years ago i thought that i would ball like im baby
but now my pops being proud could make me bawl like a baby
its crazy

thirteen never told twentythree youre gonna be like this
like this
he lied to me he lied to me oh oooh
so if you look at history feeling like your generations gonna rewrite this
write this
then ride with me ride with me oh ooh
then ride with me ride with me oh ooh
then ride with me ride with me oh ooh
then ride with me ride with me oh ooh
ride with me now ride with me now

when i was thirteen where did i see myself at twentythree question is i dont know i was thirteen sixtynine couldnt play couldnt dunk i could dominate the little kids but guys my age i couldnt touch so in my case i would go to the army base to play with the guys they would never pick me and when i walked into the gym late i could see them whispering like hey dont pick him hes terrible and i was terrible but i never gave up and i followed my dreams what i wanted to be was professional nba player i wanted to be a rapper and i wanted to be smart and through using criticism and turning it into motivation i accomplished all three so the moral of the story is haters they gon hate but use that criticism and turn it into motivation


i had to let go
even though you my bro
but you aint tryna see me grow
you aint tryna see me grow
gave them my soul
my highs and my lows
but they aint tryna see me grow
they aint tryna see me grow


kelechi dont be coming round here
kelechi always singing he switched up the sound yeah
kelechi won that fiftyk and now he on the up and up
i swear to god kelechi isnt coming down here
its been a minute i aint seen kelechi in a church
and he aint talking jesus every line and every verse
and every person that he with is either signed or on the verge
went to his show he made me stand in line to cop some merch
and he aint doing shows for free
hop on tracks and dropping flows for free
no logos not rocking niggas clothes for free
im used to seeing niggas close to me
come back down to the ground where you supposed to be
and if his squad is on then north side theyll all be slumped
and if he try me hell figure i got tommy guns
if he tweet me text me or call me son
boy if if was a fiveth then wed all be drunk


napoleon complex
you saying im simple since you saw me in complex
you say i wont last cause they saying im next
im banking you wont make a dollar off of that nonsense
rewriting my own book
turn the table of contents
niggas cant compete and im a pro with the contest
im so direct you couldnt find west with a  compass
i should kill niggas but i just chil like my mom says
how dare you be confident
how dare you believe in you
how dare you get accolades
how dare you believe its true
how dare you run off of the path that niggas was leading you
your bride wont be no princess
thats inconceivable
im tryna cop most of the whip i really dont need a roof
so if your sights set below the sky im not needing you
the letting the lies blindem im tryna see the truth
im just penning an honest letter from me to you
