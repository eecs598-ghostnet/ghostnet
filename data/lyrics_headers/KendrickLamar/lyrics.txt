i met her at this house party on el segundo and central
she had the credentials of strippers in atlanta
ass came with a hump from the jump she was a camel
i want to ride like arabians push an four mercedesbenz
hello my name is kendrick she said no youre handsome
whispered in my ear disappeared then found her dancin
ciara had played in the background
the parade music we made had us all wearin shades now

okay i know thats borderline compton or paramount
well is it compton  no she replied
and quickly start battin her eyes
and strictly had wanted her thighs around me
seventeen with nothin but pussy stuck on my mental
my motive was rather sinful
what you tryin to get into
she didnt tell just gave me her nextel
dropped the number we chirped the whole summer and well

the summer had passed and now im likin her
conversation we havin probably enticin her
who could imagine maybe my actions will end up wifin her
love or lust regardless well fuck cause the trife in us
its deeprooted the music of bein young and dumb
is never muted in fact its much louder where im from
we know a lot bout each other her mother was a crack addict

so now im down rosecrans in a caravan
passin alameda my gas meter in need of a pump
i got enough to get me through the traffic jam
at least i hope cause my pockets broke as a promise man
im thinkin about that sex thinkin about her thighs
or maybe kissin on her neck or maybe what positions next
sent a picture of her titties blowin up my texts
i looked at em and almost ran my front bumper into corvette
enthused by the touch of a woman shes a masseuse
and im a professional porn star when off the goose
i had a fifth in the trunk like curtis jackson for ransom
im hopin to get her loose like an uncle luke anthem
im two blocks away two hundred and fifty feet
and six steps from where she stay she wavin me cross the street

i promise that i know you very well
your eyes never lie even if they tell
sweet lullabies that come with a smell
of a dozen roses flipping down the green hill
youre living in a world that come with plan b
cause plan a never relay a guarantee
and plan c never could say just what it was
and your plans only can pan around love
you love him you love them you love her
you love so much you love when love hurts
you love red bottom and gold that say queen
you love handbag on the waist of your jean
you love french tip and trip that pay for
you love bank slip that tell you we paid more
you love a good hand whenever the card dealt
but what love got to do with it when you dont love yourself

i do what i wanna do
i say what i wanna say when i feel and i
look in the mirror and know im there
with my hands in the air im proud to say yeah
im real im real im really really real
im real im real im really really real
im real im real im really really real
im real im real cause before you know it everythings gone

i promise that i know you very well
your eyes never lie even if they fell
out the sky and your optics turn stale
where they mold thats green i can see you fit the bill
of living in a world that come with plan b
cause plan a only can make another mistake
and you cant see success coming from plan c
when it all breaks youll still say youre lovely
and love them and love when you love her
you love so much you love when love hurts
you love fast cars and dead presidents old
you love fast women you love keepin control
of everything that you love you love beef

look in the mirror and know im there
with my hands in the air im proud to say yeah
im real im real im really really real
im real im real im really really real
im real im real im really really real
im real im real cause before you know it everythings gone

the reason why i know you very well
cause we have the same eyes cant you tell
the days i tried to cover up and conceal
my pride it only made it harder for me to deal
when living in a world that come with plan b
a scapegoat cause plan a dont come free
and plan c just an excuse like because
or the word but but what if i got love
i love them i love when i love her
i love so much i love when love hurts
i love first verse cause youre the girl i attract
i love second verse cause youre the homie that pack
burner like a stove top that love cooking from scratch
i love what the both of you have to offer
in fact i love it so much i dont love anything else
but what love got to do with it when i dont love myself
to the point i should hate everything i do love
should i hate living my life inside the club
should i hate her for watching me for that reason
should i hate him for telling me that im seizin
should i hate them for telling me ball out
should i hate street credibility im talkin about
hating all money power respect in my will
or hating the fact none of that shit make me real

i do what i wanna do
i say what i wanna say when i feel and i
look in the mirror and know im there
with my hands in the air im proud to say yeah

i said when the lights shut off and its my turn
to settle down my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me

i woke up this morning and figured id call you
in case im not here tomorrow
im hopin that i can borrow
a peace of mind im behind on whats really important
my mind is really distorted
i find nothing but trouble in my life
im fortunate you believe in a dream
this orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
and last night was just another distraction
or a reaction of what we consider madness
i know exactly what happened
you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
but the type of bullet that stuck
had went against his will thats blood spilled on your hands
my plans rather vindictive
everybodys a victim in my eyes
when i ride its a murderous rhythm
and outside became pitch black
a demon glued to my back whispering get em
i got em and i aint give a fuck
that same mentality i told my brother not to duck
in actuality its a trip how we trip off of colors
i wonder if ill ever discover a passion like you and recover
the life that i knew as a youngin
in pajamas and duntaduns
when thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
dumb niggas like me never prosper
prognosis of a problem child im proud and welldevoted
this piru shit been in me forever
so forever ima push it wherever whenever
and i love you cause you love my brother like you did
just promise me youll tell this story when you make it big
and if i die before your album drop i hope gunshots

promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off and its my turn
to settle down my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me

you wrote a song about my sister on your tape
and called it sectioneighty
the message resembled brendas got a baby
whats crazy was i was hearin about it
but doubted your ignorance
how could you ever just put her on blast and shit
judgin her past and shit
well its completely my future
her nigga behind me right now askin for ass and shit
and ima need that forty dollars
even if i got to fuck suck and swallow
in the parking lot gonzales park im followed
by a married man and father of three
my titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin keys
matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with es
he got a cousin named david and i seen him last week
this is the life of another girl damaged by the system
these foster homes i run away and never do miss em
see my hormones just run away and if i can get em
back to where they used to be then ill probably be in the denim
of a family gene that show women how to be woman
or better yet a leader you need her to learn somethin
then you probably need to beat her thats how i was taught
three niggas in one room first time i was tossed
and im exhausted but fuck that sorry for your loss shit
my sister died in vain but what point are you tryna gain
if you cant fit the pumps i walk in
ill wait your rebuttal a little too late
and if you have a album date just make sure im not in the song
cause i dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own
and matter fact did i mention that i physically feel great
a doctors approval is a waste of time i know im straight
ill probably live longer than you and never fade away
ill never fade away ill never fade away i know my fate
and im on the grind for this cake ima get it or die tryin
im eyein every male gender with intentions of buyin
you lyin to these motherfuckers
talkin about you can help em with my story
you can help me if you sell this pussy for me nigga
dont ignore me nigga fuck your glory nigga you aint shit

when the lights shut off and its my turn
to settle down my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off and its my turn
to settle down my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me

sometimes i look in the mirror
and ask myself am i really scared of passin away
if its today i hope i hear a
cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
with the holy ghost til it drown in the blood of jesus
i wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin
the scent of a reaper ensurin that my allegiance
with the other side may come soon and if im doomed
may the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
i suffer a lot
and every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
i tie my stomach in knots
and im not sure why im infatuated with death
my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful
and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
maybe cause im a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
really stuck in the schema of wonderin when ima rest
and youre right your brother was a brother to me
and your sisters situation was the one that pulled me
in a direction to speak on somethin
thats realer than the tv screen
by any means wasnt tryin to offend or come between
her personal life i was like it need to be told
cursin the life of twenty generations after her soul
exactly whatd happen if i aint continue rappin
or steady bein distracted by money drugs and fourfives
i count lives all on these songs
look at the weak and cry pray one day youll be strong
fightin for your rights even when youre wrong
and hope that at least one of you sing about me when im gone
am i worth it did i put enough work in

promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off and its my turn
to settle down my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me

promise that youll sing about me forever
promise that youll sing about me for ooooh
promise that youll sing about me forever
promise that youll sing about me for ooooh
promise that youll sing about me forever
promise that youll sing about me for ooooh

look inside these walls and you see im havin withdrawals
of a prisoner on his way
trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
track attire just tell you im tired and ran away
i should ask a choir what do you require
to sing a song that acquire me to have faith
as the record spin i should pray
for the record i recognize that im easily prey
i got ate alive yesterday
i got animosity buildin its probly big as a buildin
me jumpin off of the roof is me just playin it safe
but what am i posed to do when the topic is red or blue
and you understand that i aint
but know im accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble
and live in the street with rank
no better picture to paint than me walkin from bible study
and called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
from a function that tooken place they was wonderin if i bang
step on my neck and get blood on your nike checks
i dont mind cause one day youll respect
the good kid maad city

mass hallucination baby
ill education baby
want to reconnect with your elations
this is your station baby

all i see is strobe lights blindin me in my hindsight
findin me by myself promise me you can help
in all honesty i got time to be copacetic until
you had finally made decision to hold me against my will
it was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
i can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
every time you clock in the morning i feel you just want to kill
all my innocence while ignorin my purpose to persevere
as a better person i know you heard this and probably in fear
but what am i posed to do when the blinkin of red and blue
flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
and you ask lift up your shirt because you wonder if a tattoo
of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
gang files but that dont matter because the matter is racial profile
i heard em chatter hes probly young but i know that hes down
step on his neck as hard as your bulletproof vest
he dont mind he know well never respect
the good kid maad city

mass hallucination baby
ill education baby
want to reconnect with your elations
this is your station baby

all i see in this room twentys xannies and these shrooms
grownup candy for pain can we live in a sane
society its entirely stressful upon my brain
you hired me as a victim i quietly hope for change
when violence is the rhythm inspired me to obtain
the silence in this room with twentys xannies and shrooms
some grownup candy i lost it i feel its nothin to lose
the streets sure to release the worst side of my best
dont mind cause now you ever in debt to good kid maad city

mass hallucination baby
ill education baby
want to reconnect with your elations
this is your station baby

she said im down on my luck
and its something i gotta have
blue faces
i hit the bank today and told them color me bad
blue faces
get that new money and its breaking me down honey

two tears in the bucket i cry with you
but i could never lie with you
i could never afford not to afford
i could never put my plans to the side with you
i could never see a red light
like a deer with a headlight
i freeze up when i reup
see i barely have patience
and youre relating
only the moment to complete us
why you hate to work for it
the reason i never went to work for it
see a nine to five was so jive turkey
but when thanksgiving came that check didnt hurt me
you plead the fifth
i read the fifth amendment
we both criminals with bad intentions
they say time heals all
but if i can shortcut
my success corvettes by tomorrow
wait a minute

now why you so sad
walking around with them blue faces
she said im down on my luck
and its something i gotta have
blue faces
i hit the bank today and told them color me bad
blue faces
get that new money and its breaking me down honey

my home girl got a credit card scam
she got a scholarship to college but she dont give a damn
intuition got a broke bitch wishin
she tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
i know you woman i console you woman
you feel like the universe owes you woman
oh the anticipation of hoping you could make it
bitches dont prosper chasing education
but youre talented and cant handle it
and your homegirls cant be your manager
three hundred and sixtyfive times four plus more
if you cant get it right tell me do you got the stamina
but shit aint no money like fast money
even today im considered a crash dummy
a rapper chasing stardom how can i fast forward
my accolades better than all them

why you so sad
walking around with them blue faces
she said im down on my luck
and its something i gotta have
blue faces
i hit the bank today and told them color me bad
blue faces
get that new money and its breaking me down honey

i wrote this song looking at a broke home baby
you know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and babies
somebody yell kendrick american they sho is crazy
and i said why
then he looked me in the eye and said nigga you fucked up
youre banking on good luck you wishing for miracles
you never been through shit youre crying hysterical
you settle for everything complain about everything
you say you sold crack my world amphetamine
your projects aint shit i live in a hut bitch
im living to keep warm you living to pay rent
i prayed my way through by waiting on allah
you played your way through by living in scifi
bullshitting yourself you talking to strangers
same thing goes for the ones you came with
when yall came on the boat looking for hope
and all you can say is that youre looking for dope
these days aint no compromise
and your pain aint mines half the time
a brand new excuse aint shit to me
bitch i made my moves with shackled feet
cape town

in todays day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
you wait on them him and her
but when a blessing takes too long thats when you go wrong
you selfish motherfucker

why so sad
walking around with them blue faces
she said im down on my luck
and its something i gotta have
blue faces
i hit the bank today and told them color me bad
blue faces
get that new money and its breaking me down honey

pimp pimp hooray

the hardest thing for me to do
is to get you to know me within sixteen bars
thats the hardest thing

who is k dot a young nigga from compton
on the curb writing raps next to a gunshot
on the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
the fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
everyone i knew was either crip or piru
cousins in elementary relatives in high school
with that being said each one of their rivals
was aiming something at my head i needed survival
got jumped got jacked shot at shot back
and i dont even push a line im just tryna push these rhymes
in the midst of staying neutral and discrete
my momma said youre judged by the company you keep
but what you can consider that if it goes down
theyll kill you if you kill me it gets deep nigga
so if you ask what im doing
im tryna duck the influence of my city thats brewing real talk and

this is why they fuck with me real talk nigga believe it

but one thing you should consider im the realest you know

i was walking from centennial
when an unidentified vehicle rolled up and i was like hol up
where you from i dont bang
where you stay westside thats a piru gang to be exact
well aware they had blue across they hat
dropped backpack and ran inside of the culdesac
shots rang out hoping to god i wasnt wet
crossed across rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
chirped the homies on the ininetyfive they said they already knew
what happened and meet em outside the garage
never seen that many guns in my life
i was paranoid like a fiend in the night but needed revenge
grabbed the nineball opened up the door then got in
somebody said fall back we gon make these niggas suffer

thought about that so long i had failed my finals fuck but

this is why they fuck with me i told you nigga

in hub city on hubcaps no powersteering
i use perseverance in this mad city
where the niggas drink remy and hold semis for cutthroats
bernie mac died its no joke
dont ask why if you dont know about these killers and thieves
seven grams of weed you smoke that but im high off life
i could fall out the sky like twice
and land in the land of the aks
and the minivans where the fan never on
cause its hotter than a lunatics underarms in a straitjacket
in other words we get it cracking but i keep it cool you know

this is why they fuck with me haha

black pendleton ball cap west west west
we dont share the same synonym fall back west west west
been in it before internet had new acts
mimicking radios nemesis made me wack
my innocence limited the experience lacked
ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
the mind of a literate writer but i did it in fact
you admitted it once i submitted it wrapped in plastic
remember scribblin scratchin dilligent sentences backwards
visiting freestyle cyphers for your reaction
now i can live in a stadium pack it the fastest
gamblin benjamin benefits sinnin in traffic
spinnin women in cartwheels linen fabric on fashion
winnin in every decision
kendrick is master that mastered it
isnt it lovely how menaces turned attraction
pivotin rappers finish your fraction while writing blue magic
thank god for rap i would say it got me a plaque
but whats better than that
the fact it brought me back home

we been waitin for you
waitin for you
waitin for you
waitin for you

i know everything
i know everything know myself
i know morality spirituality good and bad health
i know fatality might haunt you
i know everything i know compton
i know street shit i know shit thats conscious
i know everything i know lawyers advertisement their sponsors
i know wisdom i know bad religion i know good karma
i know everything i know history
i know the universe works mentally
i know the perks of bullshit isnt meant for me
i know everything i know cars clothes hoes and money
i know loyalty i know respect i know those thats ornery
i know everything the highs the lows the groupies the junkies
i know if im generous at heart i dont need recognition
the way im rewarded well thats gods decision
i know you know that lines for compton school district
just give it to the kids dont gossip bout how it was distributed
i know how people work
i know the price of life im knowin how much its worth
i know what i know and i know it well not to ever forget
until i realized i didnt know shit
the day i came home

we been waitin for you
waitin for you
waitin for you
waitin for you

i met a little boy that resembled my features
nappy afro gap in his smile
handmedown sneakers bounced through the crowd
run a number on man and woman that crossed him
sun beamin on his beady beads exhausted
tossin footballs with his ashy black ankles
breakin new laws mama passed on home trainin
he looked at me and said kendrick you do know my language
you just forgot because of what public schools had painted
oh i forgot dont kill my vibe thats right youre famous
i used to watch on channel five tv was taken
but never mind youre here right now dont you mistake it
its just a new trip take a glimpse of your familys ancestor
make a new list of everything you thought was progress
and that was bullshit
i know your life is full of turmoil
spoiled by fantasies of who you are i feel bad for you
i can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin you
if you resist ill back off quick go catch a flight or two
but if you pick destiny over rest in peace
then be an advocate tell your homies especially
to come back home

this is a world premiere
this is a world premiere
this is a world premiere

i been lookin for you my whole life an appetite
for the feeling i can barely describe where you reside
is it in a woman is it in money or mankind

lets talk about love
jump jump jump jump
lets talk about love

for the feeling i can barely describe where you reside
is it in a woman is it in money or mankind
tell me something think im losing my mind ah
i say where you at from the front to the back
im lookin for you i react only when you react
ah i thought i found you back in the ghetto
when i was seventeen with the thirtyeight special
maybe youre in a dollar bill maybe youre not real
maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
maybe im paranoid ha maybe i dont need you anyway
dont lie to me im suicidal anyway
i can be your advocate
i can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is


ima get my uncle sam to fuck you up
you aint no king


i remembered you was conflicted
misusing your influence sometimes i did the same
abusing my power full of resentment
resentment that turned into a deep depression
found myself screamin in the hotel room
i didnt wanna selfdestruct
the evils of lucy was all around me
so i went runnin for answers


the ghost of mandela hope my flow stay propellin
let these words be your earth and moon
you consume every message
as i lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
and with that being said my nigga let me ask this question

or question my character and degrade me on every blog

you think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt
you think yall on common ground if you promise to be the first can you be immortalized without your life being expired
even though you share the same blood is it worth the time
like who got your best interest
like how much are you dependent
how clutch are the people that say they love you
and who pretending
how tough is your skin when they turn you in
do you show forgiveness
what brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended
what kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing
what kind of bridge did they burn
revenge or your mind when its mentioned
you wanna love like nelson  you wanna be like nelson
you wanna walk in his shoes but you peacemaking seldom
you wanna be remembered that delivered the message
that considered the blessing of everyone

i know this girl she a real good girl and she be lowkey
looking like a star with a real nice car a mercedes key
she got a nigga and she love this nigga well at least i think
everytime we bark she pay us no mind in the middle of the street
she be like

fuck them other niggas cause im down for my nigga
fuck them other niggas cause im down for my nigga
fuck them other niggas ill ride for my nigga
ill die for my nigga fuck them other

until one day he wasnt acting right
in the middle of the night she checked his phone erica right
when he plead the fifth man it was on matter of fact she gone
matter of fact tyrone was on speed dial
so when she got home it was going down she go

fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
sick of lies from her nigga fuck that other

i know this girl she a real hood girl and she with the shit

she be like

fuck them other niggas cause im down for my nigga
fuck them other niggas cause im down for my nigga
fuck them other niggas ill ride for my nigga
ill die for my nigga fuck them other

until one day he wasnt acting right in the middle of the night
she checked his pockets found condoms by magnum
and the moment they was acknowledged she popped his eye
then ran outside then started driving on the passenger side
homeboy was smiling she gon

fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga

to lend each other uncover emotions when lights dim
so when she telling her to come over itll be alright
the minute she hit the block and turn left shell be turning dyke they

fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
fuck with other bitches on the side cause these niggas

tammys song


uhuh fuck that fuck that

eight doobies to the face fuck that
twelve bottles in the case nigga fuck that
two pills and a halfweight nigga fuck that
got a high tolerance when your age dont exist

man i swear my nigga trippin off that shit again
pick him up then i set him in cold water
then i order someone to bring him vicodin
i hope that take the pain away
from the feelin that he felt today
you know when you part of sectioneighty
and you feel like no one can relate
cause you are you are a loner loner
marijuana endorphins make you stronger stronger
im in the house party trippin off
my generation sippin cough syrup like its water
never no pancakes in the kitchen
man not one of our lives is caught up
in the daily superstition that the world is bout to end
who gives a fuck we never do listen
less it comes with a eight hundred and eight a melody and some hoes
playstation and some drank technology bought my soul
lookin around and all i see
is a big crowd thats product of me
and they probably relatives relevant for a rebels dream
yep her president is black she black too
purple label on her back but that tab is light blue
she take it straight to the head
then she look at me she got adhd

eight doobies to the face fuck that
twelve bottles in the case nigga fuck that
two pills and a halfweight nigga fuck that
got a high tolerance when your age dont exist

and then she started
and then she started feelin herself
like no one else in this apartment
beg your pardon oh i rap baby
how old are you she say twentytwo i say twentythree
okay then we are crack babies
damn why you say that she said where my drink at
ima tell you later
just tell your neighbors that the police relaxed
i stood up shut the blind closed the screen jumbotron
made to the back where she reside
then she said read between the lines
yep hope that i get close enough when the lights turn down
and the fact that she just might open up
when the nuvo start to drown
her body and i know
the both of us really deep in the mood now
its nothin we can do now
somebody walked in with a pound of that bay area kush
she looked at me then looked at it
then she grabbed it then she said get it understood
you know why we crack babies
because we born in the eightys that adhd crazy

eight doobies to the face fuck that
twelve bottles in the case nigga fuck that
two pills and a halfweight nigga fuck that
got a high tolerance when your age dont exist


uh and lord knows shes beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
she take the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
she play mr shakur thats her favorite rapper
bumping brendas got a baby while a pervert yelling at her
and she capture features of a woman but only seventeen
the seven cars start honking she start running like flojo
dont care if they joe blow
if they got money to blow a blow job is a sure go
and sure enough dont see a dime of dirty dollars
she give all to her daddy but she dont know her father thats ironic
see a block away from lueders park i seen the el camino parked
in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
rosa parks never a factor when she making ends meet

and lord knows shes beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
her anatomy is gods temple
and its quite simple her castle is bout to be destroyed
shes always paranoid watching the law inside the streets
undercovers the dummies that look like decoys
remember the sergeant let her slide said if he seen
whats between her thighs hed compromise to no surprise
she took the ultimatum round the alleyway and gave him
a warm welcome that filled him right below the navel
though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
his eyes was closed shut prior charges he had waived em
it was a block away from lueders park i seen a squad car parked
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
cause rosa parks never a factor when she topping off police

and lord knows shes beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
as she bust down like a twelve bunk on tour
she suddenly realized shell never escape the allure
of a black man white man needing satisfaction
at first it became a practice but now shes numb to it
sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
but she never heard of catholic religion or sinners redemption
that sounds foolish and you can blame it on her mother
for letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
ten months before she was ten he moved in and thats when he touched her
this mothafucka is the fucking reason why keisha rushing through that
block away from lueders park i seen the el camino park
and in her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters still she hit the back seat
and caught a knife inside the bladder left for dead raped in the street
keishas song

my little sister eleven i looked her right in the face
the day that i wrote this song sat her down and pressed play


greeting boys and girls greetings boys and girls
my name is petey p my name is petey p
kendricks childhood imaginary friend thats right thats right thats right
i am your neighbor i am your neighbor
and id like to welcome you to good kid maad city good kid maad city
so grab your cartoons and cereal and sing
