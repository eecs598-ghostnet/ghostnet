before we go any further
friends

as you call em they call you when they need something
trees for the blunt the gs for the front
i found a way to get peace of mind for years and left the hell alone
turn a deaf ear to the cellular phone
send me a letter or better we could see each other in real life
just so you could feel me like a steel knife
at least so you could see the white of they eyes
bright with surprise once they finish spitting lies
asssociates is your boys your girls bitches niggas homies
close but really dont know me
mom dad comrade peeps brothers sisters duns dunnies
some come around when they need some money
others make us laugh like the sunday funnies
fam be around whether you paid or bummy
you could either ignore this advice or take it from me
be too nice and people take you for a dummy
so nowadays he aint so friendly
actually they wouldnt have made a worthy enemy
read the signs no feeding the baboon
seein as how they got ya back bleeding from the stab wounds
yall know the dance they smile in ya face yall know the glance
try to put em on they blow the chance
never let your socalled mans know your plans
how many of us have them a show of hands
friends is a term some people use loosely
im real choosy on what i choose to let crews see
you telling me i try to act broke
jealousy the number one killer among black folk
fellas be under some type of spell like crack smoke
ghetto cinderellas lead em right to your stack loc
just another way a chickll lead to your end
i check the dictionary for the meaning of friend
it said person one who likes to socialize with
sympathiser helper and thats about the size of it
most of the time these attributes is onesided
to bolster the crime theyre apt to shoot you through your eyelid
and they cant hide it going wild like a white bitch
sometimes ya need to cut niggas off like a light switch
click and when things get quiet
catch em like a thief in the night what a riot
i first met mr fantastik at a arms deal
dont let it get drastic think of how your momsll feel
when it get for real steel get to sparkin
everything darken and aint no talkin
for somethin so cheap it sure buys a lot of trouble
ya better off focusing than tryin to plot to bubble
or else itd be a sad note to end on the guns we got is
ones we can depend on friends
some come in the form of codependence
a lot of times only end up being codefendants
ten bucks say they tell for a lower sentence
and leave you up under the jail begging for a penance
it dont make no sense what happened to the loyalty
honor amongst crooks trust amongst royalty
id rather go out in a blaze than give em the glory
how many of us have a similar story
friends before lovers we used to have some type of overstanding
just so when i let her get the man thing she know its no strings
we could do the damn thing but ho its no rings
just how the tramp swings
will she see em again
that depends on how good was the skins and could she memorize the lessons
it aint no need to pretend
even though she let em stab it she know theyre just friends

friends
how many of us have them
friends
ones we can depend on
friends
how many of us have them
friends
before we go any further

fellas dont be silly i know who my friends are
and the next nice neighborhood i move into you guysll get crack
negro humor always escaped me

instead of having learned his lesson doom was bitter angry vengeful
my face it is hideous
he traveled the world seeking a cure for his disfigured face
im sorry sir there is nothing we can do for you
he traveled through remote villages where strangers are seldom seen
he continued his search never showing his face
unless threatened by bandits who prey on travelers
who foolishly wander alone through their domain


i get no kick from champagne
mere alcohol doesnt thrill me at all
so tell me why shouldnt it be true
i get a kick out of brew

theres only one beer left
rappers screaming all in our ears like were deaf
tempt me do a number on the label
eat up all they emcees and drink em under the table
like its on meput it on my tab kid
however you get there foot it cab it iron horse it
youre leaving on your face forfeit
i crush the mic hold it like the heat he might toss it
told him tell her they stole it he told her he lost it
she told him get off it and a bunch of other more shit
getting money dts be getting no new leads
its like he eating watermelon stay spitting new seeds
its the weed give me some of what he drooping off
soon as he wake up choking like it was whooping cough
they group been soft
first hour at the open bar and theyre trooping off
he went to go laugh and get some head by the side road
she asked him autograph her derriere read
to wide load this yard bird taste like fried toad turd
love villain take pride in code words
crooked eye mold nerd geek with a cold heart
probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart
study how to eat to die by the pizza guy
no hes not too fly to skeet in a skeezer eye
and squeeze her thigh maybe give her curves a feel
the same way she feel it when he flow with nerves of steel
they call the super when they need their back uhh plumbing fixed
how there only one left the pack comes in six
whatever happened to two and three
a herb tried to slide with four and five and got caught like what you doing g
dont make me have to get cutting like truancy
matter fact not for nothing right now you and me
looser than a pair of adidas
i hope you brought your spare tweeters mcs sound like cheerleaders
rapping and dancing like red head kingpin
doom came do his thing again no matter who be blingin
he do it for the smelly hubbies
seeds know what time it is like its time for tellie tubbies
few can do it even fewer can sell it
take it from the dude who wears mask like a tarded helmet
he plots shows like robberies
in and out one two three no bodies please
run the cash and you wont get a wet sweatshirt
the mic is the shotty nobody move nobody get hurt
bring heat like your boy done gone to war
he came in the door and everybody on the floor
a whole string of jobs like we on tour
every night on the score coming to your corner store

there it is done
now that the representative from south africa has been mind programmed
all of the world leaders on earth are under my control

gumbo

you gotta watch your gums on this
but its its very good its very healthy

not perfect for every situation but edible wrappers could actually beef up your next meal
you would only want to use the wraps when theres no food associated with the use of the wraps
so uh some potential uses include um wrapping bolt packed in a larger package
and in that case the the wrap will actually form into a sauce when you cooked cooked your meats
um theres also been interest in um development of using the wrap and then actually rip up the wrap in case you will get weary the next day
its hoped edible wrappers will do a couple of things
create a new demand for produce
stop throwing out as much garbage as they do
and eat more chitlins


give it a sec for the pain to start
this wreck right here it aint for the faint of heart

and here i am known for giving heavy back aches
grown and living off of little debbie snack cakes
supposed to be checking emails
all i got is messages from ass naked females
i dont know a jenny
she said its free and i wont owe her a penny
and thats the last time i saw her
but thousands of more horrors on online gomorrah
and sodom they got em with they curls out
and they got a better sales pitch than the girl scouts
i wonder what i owe her
for a whole box of caramel coconut samoa
nite nite uh ok honey sweet dreams
now its time to get serious like peek freans
a metal handful wipe it on the quilt
wife wake up and im killt over spilt milk
locked in looking at your picture
fully clothed winter and i right there with ya
thinking about the last time i split your wishbone
a man could only wish you do the same til he get home
fat chance at least he get snacks
thatd have to do til a brother get back
until then smack oneeyed jack
and hope one of his peoples can hook him with a tripack
thats three different flavors
chocolate vanilla and strawberry wafers
acting all hard bout to get beat up
ill show him what time it is once i get this sheet up
soon as he fell off the beat down
all i hear is thirteenth cell put the sheet down
damn co what the hell do she know
besides the fact she wanna get dug out on the dlow
a workaholic with a fountain in the ink pen
out in the mountains and i stopped drinking again
in the wee hours hes gotten farther
needing three showers being hot and bothered
the wiz with her legs bent pregnant
god bless the day she wondered where her egg went
i need a l its hard to drink without it
and could use some kookies but trying not to think about it
watching bet on jazz for knowledge on file
every other commercial college hoes gone wild
soft batch i prefer the other bunch
like we got for lunch chocolate fudge butter crunch


he dont mess with the ritz bits
wheat thins saltines or triscuits
matzos or cheezits
catch sugar fits every time that he sees
chips ahoy double chocolate chunk
something with the bubble and the junk in the trunk
even the oreos no matter what weather
always kept em dipped in milk and stuck together
in the game hes shameless
even uses a code name famous amos
its cheaper than a short stay at the days inn
and good like twentyfive cent oatmeal raisin
give a hand to who invented the camera
skip past the gram animal in grandmas
shh make sure she dont wake from her dream chill
or get caught with a handful of cream fill

oh honey what are you doing thats so nasty
it might seem ill

good health to you all
uh over this way
look out

alright pops still feel like charging me for that meal

one look at his featureless face
one look was enough to ensure his safety
as years passed he became even more bitter and angry
burning with vengeance against the world
finally amidst hidden scrolls he found what hed been seeking
then clothed in a suit of invulnerable armor and possessing the worlds greatest secrets of science and magic he returned to his homeland
and there he has remained
scheming dreaming planning
plotting his mad campaign to conquer the entire world
i cant believe it
alright dont make a big deal about it
i warn you doom youve gone too far
yeah
thatll do it doom get your machine


xthree
i just lie awake and think of pleasant nights wed spend
under summers magic spell
but when autumn came her love did not remain
and made my world a living hell

oo yes here it is doom i see

 it aint nuttin like hip hop music

spilt a shot made the pen lines runny
a ill plot thats ten times ben steins money funny

with more rhymes than is lines in ya database
placing rappers in endangerment whos reckless
with this food for thought sorta like breakfast

loud enough to burst his right eardrum closerange
the game is not only dangerous but its most strange

i sell rhymes like dimes
the one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times

joking rhymes like the is you just happy to see me trick
classical slapstick rappers need chapstick
a lot of em sound like they in a talent show
so i give em something to remember like the alamo
tallyho a high joker like a spades game
came back from five years laying and stayed the same
im saying electromagnetic field it blocks all logic spock
and gshocks her biological clock
when i hit it slit it to the shitter  thought i killed her goose
her power u was pure brita water filtered juice
keep a pen like a fiend keep a pipe with him
gentleman who lent a pen to a friend who write with him
never seen the shit again but hes still my dunny
the only thing that come between us is krill and money

i sell rhymes like dimes
the one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times

better rhymes make for better songs it matters not
if you got a lot of what it takes just to get along
surrender now or suffer serious setbacks
got getback connects wetback get stacks
even if you gots to get jetblack head to toe
to get the dough battle for bottles of mo or dro
this fly flow take practice like tae bo with billy blanks
oh youre too kind really thanks
to the gone and lost forever like oh my darling clementine
he hold his heart when he telling rhyme
when its his time i hope his soul go to heaven
he nasty like the old time old no seven
you still taste it when you chase it with the cocacola
make em wish they could erase it out the motorola
i told her no credit for a bag
if you want what they got then go get it its all gack
only in america could you find a way to earn a healthy buck
and still keep your attitude on selfdestruct

i sell rhymes like dimes
the one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times

joking rhymes like the is you just happy to see me trick

hey there boys and girls

i only play the games that i win at
and stay the same with more rhymes than theres ways to skin cats
as a matter of fact let me rephrase
with more rhymes than ways to fillet felines these days
watch the path of the black one supervillain
who wrecks clubs for delf in a drunken stupor
chillin ready and willin to inadvertantly foil that plan of the rhymers they be whiners like spoiled brats
who got more snottier flows than snotty nose
and holds mics like he knows karate body blows
nobody knows the trouble i see from the mpv
fly dirty tailin the bubble eye thirty
for the record this is some shit i just thought of yall
its science fiction thats not permissible in no court of law
i live to rock mics in threed
the only reason i seek to stop to snuff the tv
i heard beats they sound like karaoke with monkey rhymers on a leash like dont let this nigga choke me
hit em with a penny so we could get these peanuts
and i thought we was nuts
i used to get free cuts
they lock lex luthor up in green haven
since when a nigga never really been too clean shaven
misbehavin rap stars need listament
call me mr bent im at where your sister went intelligent
used to write and be well spoke
now all a nigga wanna do is fight and sell
tell joke
this could lead to catastrophe
bout to stop the violence right after these last of three shots from the black bat that got me at headlock
holdin on to sanity by strands of that dreadlock
she told me get off i said bitch let me set this shit off so i could get rich
then this shit hit me like the point of intoxication
imma come out and rock this nation
like ox defacing
a lot niggas out is rusty like oxidation
in this worlds strangest most dangerous occupation
i could do it
im the super like in your building
villain like trife kinder is in all my children

with some real mature womens and some more of they friends
and when bad men roll tight
its actual true like a pack of big bambu with natural glue
who grip necks of deuce to dukes to triple x
he just came in fourd follow the ripple effects
and itll lead ya right to him
oh snap
seems weve walked into a trap through rap
zoinks this place is filled with pretender willies
one false move and get broke off like end of phillies
yes true believers
aint nothing new to a
crook with special powers like how to tell the future uhhhhh

a fly tramp thats what she called me
cause i dont wear no stetson hats like paul c
as yall see who give a fuck who know what is it
these styles will be flipped to the absolute exquisite
its like a blizzard soon as i got home from atl
looked into my babys face my boo was like  well
i know your types of clientele thoughts needs
as i held her firmly yet gentle as the soft sea
she said the one with the horse weave the pretty one
all crazy had to touch the tattoo through the short sleeve
which one you want im like if there was comp
fuck around a nigga like me probably run up in all three
king geedorah what they call me either caesar or baldy
probably have moved since last yall saw me
on the dlow i slaughter solo emcees they paperthin
in they polo nautica or dk men

amen its funny how significance make a difference
notice parables of three in every other inference
for instance who wanna battle on the real
choose your weapon microphone beats or the wheelsofsteel
i own a crown in all three for getting down without a doubt
id like to give a extra special out to jet jaguar the sun moon and star
the monster island czars  yall know who you are
get that

money
never did a thing for lovin

coming straight from the black lungs
i rip tracks for all players that pack guns
stack ones in packs done and doing backtoback runs
to my peeps that close sos ya knows whats up
yall know the doughs quick hoes that mess with fiveo shrimp like what
like they wanna shmoosh us just to packing the pushers
im packing gat then bust a cap at popo
if they catch us and try to push us
since when a miny nigga dont be taking no shit
i be that drug dealing nigga that be fucking ya bitch

what a fella like salt pepa spinderella
i came to spark the deaf dumb and blind like helen keller
if im not with george of the jungle if he not with stella
or either priscilla im doing dips on godzilla
though yall know he dont play right
tnt throws a nigga out a moving van in broad daylight
and he was shackled by hands and feet
then they say he tried to escape once his face scraped the concrete
near the curb on monster island one hundred and three street
where brothers run the risk of getting swallowed once the beast eat
id rather lay in the cut collect cash pay
only tnt i see is gilligans castaway
with mary jane and ginger
oh from which you spent the night by accident i creep like a ninja
when the mack is bent who can give one fuck
get bucked get broke up like threepiece nunchucks
yall sun struck sick to they headpiece
threeheaded beast brings the drama to a dead cease

get that money god

sick to they headpiece
get that money god

get that money god

get that money god

greenbacks  the meanest green stacks

money
never did a thing for lovin

ask me what i need i need your
money


i remember when last past november when
clown kid got pounded in with the timberlands
they left him trembling he was not remembering
never tuck your denim in just to floss an emblem
some would debate wait the fella ate gelatin
or he been listening in to what his weathermens was telling him
when i could feel it in my melanin its compelling
us to break them off no reassembling
no sciencefiction to no theater near you coming soon to
fuck with you frequently like how phases of the moon would do
you could gather round like it was an eclipse
just dont look directly to the bitch you may be blinded by the scripts
pass the l the last to tussle in them shirttails
all hail king geedorah the third rail
seven hundred volts holds rap to a standstill
fool ignore the rule fuck up and get his man killed
two bottles of dom got his hands filled
and so goes the days of our lives as the hourglass sand spill
and built with passion and a glass of the ze
and the lights went down and hey

and i knew it was the last day  wigtwisting season
when some could get their wigs twisted back within reason
mostly with these crimes of treason
and youll be lucky if theres no squeezing even this evening

from how hes feeling thrilling choice of flow is sick
hes the villain with the million dollar voicethrow trick
hes like a ventriloquist with his fist in the speakers back
couldnt think of no uniquer track nope sneak attack
it dont really matter how big them is so much as a nipple
cause you could have a chick with dtriple
cept the nipple little just hot off the griddle
like how he do monkey rhymers like monkeyinthemiddle by his damn self
aint no average mc ahead of me
getting cheddar instead of the probably better pedigree
with nicknames sick games as rick james
messy games scifly such as jesse james
blast i figure asshawking ass titty licker
last one to walk up in fasttalking city slicker
got bagged cause of the dirty chick with makeup
bail out quick for the seven hundred and thirty wakeup
my only backup was an acup as far as may
to when the leaves turn red and gold to nimrod earthday
all else worthless to say
and the lights went down and hey

thats when i knew it was the first day  wigtwisting season
when some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning
mostly with these crimes of treason men
and yall be lucky if theres no squeezing even this evening

its like a mosquito the much sweeter resent the act
i been bent back since my physical went back
since cultured more of my kin
and for them i keep an l rolled in this hellhole
hold your head use your head and hold or be dead and cold
in the worsest way soon as the leaves show red and gold
to round nimrod release day
and all else needless to say
wait a motherfucking minute true facts presented
the names was probably changed just to protect who aint in it
the xp was threequarters tinted fortyfiveths was converted
the way his shit was twisted ask him if it hurted

wigtwisting season
when some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning
mostly with these crimes of lying and fronting and cheating
all types of different styles of treason

got em on a mental plane avoided bad karma
once sold an inbred skinhead a nigga joke
plus a brand new chrome smoker with the triggers broke
i thought i told em firing pins was separate
he find out later when he tries to go and rep it
took a jehovah money for a arabic torah
charged an advance to translate it and ignored it sorta
one monkey dont stop no slaughter
a junkie want ta cop a quarter ton run for the border
know the drill it aint worth the overkill
flow skill still theres no thrill
villa bill ya ten k bills in his pilla
villa when it gets realer split the skrilla with

dilla dilla mix mix mix

villain and ya wont find him in no gym
probably a foggy bog with the frogs

in any event its fake like wrestlin

ahem elixir for the dry throat
tried to hit the high note villain since a itsy bitsy zygote

jiminy crickets
he gets lucky like winnin free tickets off simplylyrics
one mans waste is another mans soap
sons fan base know the brotha mans dope
a real weirdo with a bugged rare flow
and the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow
he wears a mask so the charge wont grab
on a rooftop with a large stone slab
heads up talk white and thought niggerish
refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorish
black licorice and equally as yucky
how he handled the money was strictly dan stuckie
monkey hustle man on fire
later for the date than the hadron collider
and cost more it be seemin like a style
doom leave the competition steamin like a pile
smile ding sparklin jewels
in effect like alternate side of the street parkin rules
fools the roach was never dead

khan is my name khan nothing else khan
as the funky beat continues a rock steady
we have got to try to find doom
good luck
time to get the feta
