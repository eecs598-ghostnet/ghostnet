record spins im going in
i dont shoot to kill i play to win
stay catching up with the cutthroats
some men shoot a nigga throw em off the tugboat no floats
the body sinks to the bottom
or left off the side of the road to smell rotten
the murder sprees random killings
ghostface killahs back attacking villains hanging from the ceilings
godfather motives gangsta mentality
black superhero with the immortality
forever i be creeping in a black mist
ill night vision with the militant tactics
i glide through the air like a swarm of bees
shake niggas off quick like a dog with fleas
raw meat leave bodies slumped in the street
revenge is the spice of life its so sweet
ay yo pipe bombs blowing they souls to jesus
dont need nothing but the puzzle glue for the pieces
meat cleaver cut finger tips like rib tips
home invasions cars gonna flip delucas lose
pair of cement shoes tossed in the ocean
popped until they brain ooze i wont lose
blood all on my apron hog tie em up while they try escaping
peeped the visual tied em up individual
took their clothes off season em like sausage
let the pits out to eat em thats the remedy
attack kill bite off their extremities
blood bath splash my name on my wall
call it piece delivery leave a tip on the stall
with an arm leg a head im coming for you all

uhhuh its the sure shot yo yeah

heart of a lion king of the jungle
im a humble killer bee you as soft as a bumble
i dont crumble i strike back hard with a vengeance
attack through these killer words i spit in a sentence
im a menace the black clark kent caped crusader
the face of a ghost i disappear in the vapors
you could murder my flesh and bone souls invincible
revenge my death paybacks the main principal
protect ya neck when you move i be lurking in the shadows
starks the gangsta nigga i never lose battles
pimp bitches with a superhero logo on my chest
big gucci link gfk on the crest
icy arm for the eagle with the eight carat ruby eyes
piss on your motherfucking lawn while im stupid high
all black down royalty purple and some ice chips
two glock nines pointed at you in a hype flick

now im alone in the room and i just stare at the wall
revenge my death but im going through withdrawals
my lost niggas i miss them this new power and wisdom
got me thinking ive made a whole lot of bad decisions
got logan still to deal with should i kill her
throw her fuckin ass in a cage with a gorilla
or let her live and treat her like scum of the earth
ive got goons to feed and babies to birth
im the god now plus im a super rich nigga
do more help than harm either way you figure
should i protect and serve or cock and aim destruction
let the enterprise take over the force of production
corruption my mind state is unpredictable
im bulletproof now back from the dead im invincible

drawing cards sent her rap message through a bottle
lines from dolemite few tips from goines
birthday gave her two fifty cent coins
puppy love gorgeous face amazed by lip gloss
cherry scent when the princess spoked yo it bounched off
mole like marilyn monroe threw a rose in her mouth

thought that she could quit but her calculations wasnt right
infactuated with the life of dope fiends and crack pushers
prostituting for old pimps who mack hookers
putting dope in the cook searching for her vein
tracks all over her arms she never felt the pain
the monkey on her back is now a gorilla
fiending for a hit knowing one day its gon kill her
the clinic didnt help nope she just another young black woman
destroying her pretty image and her health
got me thinking to myself damn how could this happen
i seen her on the corner nodding off sniffin and scratching


she wakes up with an urge to get high
everyday the same routine needing a morning fix to get by
so she reaches for her purse grab the bag and the needle
tie a sock around her arm and start shooting up the diesel
having flashbacks screwing some dude up in his hatchback
the night before body still sore holding her ass crack
a regular john she met him through tom
she passed out with the syringe still stuck in her arm
dying a slow death oh she losing her damn mind
from the troubles of the world feeling cursed by mankind
uh caught up in a desperate rage was blessed with aids
lost her appetite hardly slept in days
now its too late praying to jesus she fucked around
with the wrong penis contaminated with diseases
two months pregnant carrying around her fetus
but they found her on broad in the dumpster behind the cleaners

he probably knew the killas cause they jinxed him with ease
cops hold the perimeter thirsty looking for leads
knocking on doors questioning tenants the lieutenant
was the first to arrive on the scene he knew he was finished
dewayne roberts knew him in college midtwenties
stopped being brolic va drivers license in his wallet

good morning good morning

look at the sun so pretty today
its so bright its so smashing
lasting helps out the grass and
smile when its morning time
last night i wrote three rhymes i woke up to see the sun shine
if god is my witness
in scriptures and pictures
the sun kiss scrumptious son its nutricious
it makes me wanna climb
take a bite out of shine
this little light of mine
yo the sun could never be pussy he always come out
hell sit right there even if you pull your gun out
he can never run out when the lights go out
its japans turn now the earth has spun around
i see yellow and green its a beautiful thing
the skys blue cos the sun hit the water like bing
a reflection uhhuh and thats all it is word
you cant stare at him long cos your facell do like this

check out my nephew

and its hard to go back to work when your lunch breaks finished
straphang before so its a fact i support
feeling the warm sun rays upon your back as you walk
the heatdriven a theory i plung to deep living is
souls have to go through the sun to reach heaven
and sensing retreat our souls badden the scene
madame believe since dinosaurs and adam and eve
that suns hovered to the extermination of us
its a peephole which leads to the firmament above us

who can take a raindrop and turn it to glee
and drawn up six miles over tropical isles and bring it to the sea

the slums of a big town as packed with drama and danger as the squalling street of some native quarter in the heart of this melting pot of crime stands an oasis where one man struggles against the forces that turned his loved one to lives of violence and shame

he spares no one
he was forgotten but he was someone

metal lungies junkies nigga i pack the nine millers and thrillers
bulletproof robes and wave caps

the butcher the baker the torturer the taker
imma send you right back to your maker
a few extra holes miss your soul sold to the devil
its the rebirth of slick brought back as a rebel
im immortal gonna kill generations of your fam
you tried to loathe my legacy away but i stand stronger
gfk the pain prolonger

he was a lonely man they killed him
cause they didnt understand
though his spirit possesses a rhythm
as the words on this record unleashes the ghostface killah

young aggressor born into the life of crime
i would walk down the street strapped with two nines
bitch smacking jacking niggas g dub stacking figures

jay de lucas put me with the fam to grow
i was a boss amongst white boys rocking the fro
i had hoes bankrolls and minks by the dozen
my rise to power was quick they just wasnt
tryna make me a made man they fucked up the game plan
i blacked out on them and started my own clan
black gambino black suits the black syndicate
my crime fam was tight every move was intricate
the coke was brought in from bad colombian mules
gorgeous women that i draped down in jewels
streets fight started mafia wars in italy
crime fam against fam and no one could do diddly

do the dirty work bring in the coke by the boatloads
go against the grain nigga i feed nose holes
follow no family rules rules are for fools
chase the paper cause its the cash that rules

fuck the law of the fam its the law of the land
you dont like how i move then try to force my hand
im moving keys them delucas couldnt touch my pianos
putting pressure on them gambinis and verrazanos
they love my money they hate to see a nigga getting it
selling drugs is taboo but i aint fucking sweating it
the dirt gotta get done so i took my position
one day im just black tone with a lot of ambition
next i got status dinners with all courses
flights in and out of the country they getting nauseous
money power respect rise of the black suits
talk shit behind my back but to my face salute
hugs and handshakes they cant stop my reign
got the coconut pilots bringing shit on their plane
its a shame they aint have the balls to make moves
they pussies couldnt walk a mile in my shoes

do the dirty work bring in the coke by the boatloads
go against the grain nigga i feed nose holes
follow no family rules rules are for fools
chase the paper cause its the cash that rules
do the dirty work bring in the coke by the boatloads

record spins im going in
i dont shoot to kill i play to win
stay catching up with the cutthroats
some men shoot a nigga throw em off the tugboat no floats
the body sinks to the bottom
or left off the side of the road to smell rotten
the murder sprees random killings
ghostface killahs back attacking villains hanging from the ceilings
godfather motives gangsta mentality
black superhero with the immortality
forever i be creeping in a black mist
ill night vision with the militant tactics
i glide through the air like a swarm of bees
shake niggas off quick like a dog with fleas
raw meat leave bodies slumped in the street
revenge is the spice of life its so sweet
ay yo pipe bombs blowing they souls to jesus
dont need nothing but the puzzle glue for the pieces
meat cleaver cut finger tips like rib tips
home invasions cars gonna flip delucas lose
pair of cement shoes tossed in the ocean
popped until they brain ooze i wont lose
blood all on my apron hog tie em up while they try escaping
peeped the visual tied em up individual
took their clothes off season em like sausage
let the pits out to eat em thats the remedy
attack kill bite off their extremities
blood bath splash my name on my wall
call it piece delivery leave a tip on the stall
with an arm leg a head
im coming for you all

its the sure shot
heart of a lion king of the jungle
im a humble killer bee you as soft as a bumble
i dont crumble i strike back hard with a vengeance
attack through these killer words i spit in a sentence
im a menace the black clark kent caped crusader
the face of a ghost i disappear in the vapors
you could murder my flesh and bone souls invincible
revenge my death paybacks the main principal
protect ya neck when you move i be lurking in the shadows
starks the gangsta nigga i never lose battles
pimp nigga with a superhero logo on my chest
big gucci link gfk on the crest
icy arm for the eagle with the eight carat ruby eyes
piss on your motherfucking arm while im stupid high
all black down royalty purple and some ice chips
two glock nines pointed at you in a hype flick

now im alone in the room and i just stare at the wall
revenge my death but im going through withdrawals
my lost niggas i miss them this new power and wisdom
got me thinking ive made a whole lot of bad decisions
got locals still to deal with should i kill her
throw her fuckin ass in a cage with a gorilla
or let her live and treat her like scum of the earth
ive got goons to feed and babies to birth
im the god now plus im a super rich nigga
do more help than harm either way you figure
should i protect and serve or cock and aim destruction
let the enterprise take over the force of production
corruption my mind state is unpredictable
im bulletproof now back from the dead im invincible


roads of glory praising me the same
winds of fury cycle in the rain
cycle in the rain with the span of time
through the frame of mind the winds remind
roads of glory praising me the same
winds of fury cycle in the rain
cycle in the rain with the span of time
through the frame of mind the winds remind

if any body knew that time would
sit to show me in the time would never start anew
if any body knew that time would

those who fear his return
must face the catastrophe

i keep having flashbacks of blasting at you bastards cutting outside the benches
got convicted of the gun charge and laughed at my sentence
four years five flat postrelease supervision
for niggas spitting in the wind but thats what i get for missing
so soon as i hit the bridge again niggas is finished
ninja mode on a mission out to end your existence
think im sitting up in prison
with a tin of l in a cell sick ass hell listen
everyday is like christmas i miss my seed and my missus
but i see em on visits i aint stressing over pussy
beat my dick to her pictures
when they free me imma see you leave you food for the fishes
hope the luca crew is in for the fixing
now get the henchman line em up
tommy gun em down the muzzle extension
tear they flesh off if one of em flinching

those who fear his return must face the catastrophe
the catastrophe

those who fear his return must face the catastrophe
the catastrophe
