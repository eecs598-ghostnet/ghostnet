at the very moment when they looked around and said

take it back take it way back
take it way way back to about one thousand nine hundred and ninety
shady grove hospital in rockville maryland
seven hundred and thirtysix am where a biracial baby was born
to a black father and a white mother
father that wasnt there
addicted to crack cocaine alcohol and various other drugs
same as his mom
way way back
so im gonna tell you about that right
and im gonna tell you about how
all this young boy ever wanted was happiness
all he ever wanted was positivity
all he ever wanted to do was entertain
and this boy went through hell
you gotta understand his mother was racist which is crazy
cause how in the fuck is you gonna have
all these black babies with black men but you racist
like bitch that dont make no sense but it is what it is
you know he grew up her callin him a nigger
the kids at school callin him a cracker
identifying as black looking as white
being told what you can or cant be
this kid went through everything
he went through
he saw narcotics in the household
violence murderers drug dealers he was kidnapped
there was crazy shit that happened to this kid
and he persevered while the whole world said
what they said
said you wouldnt be shit
you aint gon be nothin nothin nothin nothin
nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothin nothing
and i and he he said fuck that ima persevere
and thats why the message is always peace love and positivity
see he always saw things from two sides
he always saw things from two sides
he always knew that the message
everybody was born equal
regardless of race religion color creed and sexual orientation
he knew that because he saw that
take it back take it way back
take it way
because he was stripped and torn down
by his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated
and that did not know
and he was stripped and he was torn down
by his white side that did not know
these people that are ignorant
that cannot see the bigger picture
that must fight and kill and murder each other
but once again all he ever wanted to do
was spread a message of equality
for every man woman and child
regardless of race religion color creed and sexual orientation
take it back take it way back
take it way way back to the first
now imagine this child growing up
and seeing the craziest shit
being a part of the craziest shit
running around with the wrong people
running around with guns and knives
and fighting and stealing and and all this
because he didnt know he didnt know
but he knew deep down in his heart that it wasnt right
and he knew that he needed to get away from it
now i want you to also imagine that at seventeen years old
this child okay leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself
two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings
and then he would then come home
to about eight or nine hours of sleep
but spend four five six hours of that
working on music persevering
grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror
and pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people
just chanting his name
hoping that it would happen
but the but the but the world said no
mothafucka little mothafucka nono nono nono nono
ya nigga ya cracka ya white boy ya black mothafucka
nono
take it back take it way back
take it way way back to the first
and he said fuck that
he said peace love and positivity
he said equality for all man
regardless of race religion color creed and sexual orientation yeah
now i want you to also imagine
people telling him that he did not live this life
you just a white boy
you aint never experienced that shit
you from gaithersburg maryland nothing happens there
oh no no we know we werent there
we didnt live with you we didnt live in your section eight household
we didnt live with the narcotics and violence in your household
we just saw it from the outside outside outside outside
outside outside outside outside
and since you white you gotta have money right
take it back take it way back
take it way way back to the first black man
and this young man persevered in spite
of what people told him he was wasnt and would never be
take it back take it way back
take it way way back to the first black
and that man is here today proud
a lover of all human beings
regardless of race religion color creed sexual orientation yeah yeah
and hes here to say
even though were all born and created equal
we are not treated equally
theres extremists on every side
and you should just do your best to live life
and let other people believe whatever they wanna believe
as long as theyre not hurtin anybody
you can believe theyre going to hell
you can believe its not right
you can believe youre superior fine
just stop killing each other

i remember somehow someway
i remember somehow someway
i remember somehow someway
i remember somehow someway

it was december of two thousand and fifteen in sunny los angeles california in the heart of hollywood
i stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch star wars
when suddenly i was engulfed with fear and panic
as my body began to fade
in this moment my mind was full of clarity
but my body insisted it was in danger
i looked around and i told myself i was safe i was fine
but i was convinced that something was wrong
before i knew it i felt as though i was going to
fall and fade away
my body grew weak
and soon enough i found myself in a hospital bed being told what i went through was anxiety
i refused to believe this story
i searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me
i began to feel detached from reality
i felt as though i was seeing the world through a glass
i got blood work done
analysis of my mind and body to no avail
the doctor said it was anxiety
but how could it be anxiety
how could anxiety make me physically feel off balance
how could anxiety make me feel as though i was fading from this world and on the brink of death
derealization
the sense of being out of ones body
im not here
im not me
im not real
nothing is
nothing but this feeling of panic
nobody understands
nobody knows the sufferings
this physical feeling
it cant be anxiety
it cant
or can it
can it in fact be the mind controlling the body
yeah of course
im so in control of my mind and my body
but im subconsciously forcing myself into a state
of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind
i am unhappy
not with life
but with this feeling
i am scared i am human i am a man
but i look in the mirror and i see a child
i am an adult who recognize grown ups dont really know shit
and they never did
and it scares me
cause now im just a grown up who doesnt know shit
but one thing is i do know this feeling this horrible feeling is going to kill me
no no this feeling
this anxiety is nothing
i have anxiety
just like you the person i wrote this for
and together we will overcome this feeling
we will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge
that we are alive
and any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted
we will rejoice in this gift that is life
we will rejoice in this day that we have been given
we will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves
starting with mental health
we will accept ourselves as we are
and we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror
we will accept ourselves
and live with anxiety

its kind of funny how life changed and rearranged
no matter what happens everything aint gon be the same
the incredible album what an incredible outcome
i grip the mic and then talk to the people like im malcolm
i used to think the fame and money was the motivation
until i toured the world and met the people face to face and
understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
it aint about the money and notoriety
its about the people and making a difference in society
but dont get it twisted this life im living is like a movie
the godfather the goodfella wielding a uzi
one with the people if the people is wondering whos he
same level the same rebel that never settled
pullin strings like geppetto who overcame the ghetto
and i know you wrote me and i still aint answered

i used to spend all my time conversing with you
but now i write this song to let you know im hurting with you
shit is too big but lets be honest man its kinda bittersweet
besides the shows and meet and greets yall only see me on the street
and even then that shit is rarei just dont go outside
cause honestly i dont fuck with this world id rather hide
that misconception cause i rap i must be filled with pride
shit i aint perfect if you heard different then someone lied
people in my ear telling me talk that shit
actions speak louder than words id rather walk that shit

the mood around me is people smokin it by the ounce
leave friday for the show and come back monday with a hundred grand
dont fuck with checks so when i bounce i prefer cash in hand
you know my first week looking crazy due to high demand
cause people dont buy music in this day and age they buy the brand
theres ups and downs dont get me wrong but back when i aint have shit
felt like i woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit
thank god he never let lucifer close enough to ask

its the type of shit that they read about
like chris said i gotta bleed it out
ive been in the zone i cant be without
this real shit that i be about
im a visionary thats long term
but def jam said they need it out
if i rush this shit i might be without
but i need a vision cant see without
ive been patient never complacent
left the underground when i left the basement
thats renovation i spit this verse like a revelation
on the road with kid cudi and big
conversations with no id
who made hits with ye got hits with jay
now he wanna fuck around and make hits with me
if its meant to be then its meant to be
cant express what that meant to me what it mean to me
man i swear the shit like a dream to me what it seemed to be
its so different now everything is so different now
ive been there and ive done that
tell em all that i run that thats a fun fact
and im back again cause i love this shit
write it down and they publish it
i went five years without a publicist
cause the word of mouth they in love with this
ive been dreaming ive been scheming
went away a while but ive been fiending
ive missed the fam but they know the deal
been at it way before the deal
now the  music got mass appeal
my main girl got ass appeal
like i feel the vibe thats the main thing
little fish that went mainstream
now im big as fuck
my whole city they know whats up
im unseen and im in the cut about extra shit
i dont give a fuck
when im on the phone dont interrupt
if im talking business i might erupt
if youre at the show put your lighter up
fuck with me if youre really bout it
outsiders i could do without it
i crept in got slept on
sold out shows no one knew about it
when it comes to fucks i give two about it
your cosign i could do without it

okay last verse i gotta make it count
wont speak on my bank account
so many commas id have to pause
and i cant afford to just waste the bars
every day boy i thank the lord
i got a lot of problems but could have more
wish i spoke to my dad more my jeweler less
i been hungry like budapest
tell me who the best dont give a fuck
i just know im blessed
love life even though im stressed
this business boy i swear a test
tell def jam if they dont cut the check
ill send chris to go cut they neck
i love the building no disrespect
but yall better ride when im in effect
thats radio thats tv but visionary got the internet
if yall fuck around or try to throw the ball to another artist
ima intercept its my time
put half a mill of my own money in this album
thats my dime no rap features just my rhymes
my story its all mine from the basement to the stadium
from the roxy to palladium
ive been there and ive done that yes i run that
with this pretty girl on my floor
half naked playing connect four
but ive been trying to throw sex out the window
just to connect more
she so fine type of girl i wanna fuck her mind
and then unwind with some slow head
all my homies like go head
anyway its been a long time
and this here has been a long rhyme so i gotta go
its logic the one nobody would vouch for
hows that shit for an outro

yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yyeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah

every day that they live and breathe is extended to them
they may be misinformed about the truth they may be misguided somebody has led them on the wrong path
a path of corruption and destruction but yet gods mercy every day that they live is extended to them and they have another opportunity to be saved

yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yyeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yyeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah


goddamn goddamnconversations with legends
crazy how one day your idols can turn into your brethren
bitches we severin hit up my jeweler watch him freeze us
breaking bread like im jesus
money aint everything but somehow eases
better believe than think down and leave us the baby cryin
crack cooking where my sister be frying soul food
plus my other sister just went back to her old dude
he whoopin her assill kill him ill kill him
ill motherfuckin kill him
i said i really want to kill himbut i cant
cause if i do popo gon claim im the villain but i aint
see my vision from pictures i paint
do you feel it like i feel it
i grip the mic and then kill itokay im gone
as memories resurface from hella long in my past
chillin sippin sinatra from a flask
little bobby just a youngin skating was my hobby
tryna stay out of trouble my homie in jail for robbery
welfare food stamps and stealing from the store
come home and see an eviction notice taped to my door
cant take no more momma on drugs daddy mia
what can i say i just wanted to be a kid and play
to this day i pay homage to the gods to the greats
never stolen im from maryland
where they shoot you in the dark of the night
like christopher nolan for talking outta your colon
catch me rollin with the realest
lyricism the illest my chain is the chillest sub zero
far from a hero bitch im de niro in goodfellas
if your bitch around me best bring an umbrella
let me tap into my inner southern killer none other illa
murder the game and then resurrect it like thriller
yeah my skin is vanilla but bitch i dare ya to test my killa
we dont do it for the skrilla we do it for love
word to my homies up above we slinging like drugs
and overdose em like the dealer does logic

i swear this music in my genes like denim
lyricism seep in em like venom
yes i know the flow hotter than lucifer
even though heaven sent him

see my vision as ive elevated and risen
open your eyes despise lies told with deadly precision
i finally made my way up out that section eight division
not by busting and killing though ive had my share of stealin
but by putting pen to this pad and dispersing these feelings
while the label only care about making a killin
feel my energyi aint talking energy i mean inner g
thats the shit they never see
but i own supremacy number onei better be
bitch i said i bet i be
take my kindness for weakness trying to get the better of me
tell me how is they gon remember me
as the artist that concocted the perfect recipe
or will they be addressing me talking less of me
just cause i was different
just cause i was doing what i love
and the fans they say they love you
but they push and they shove
cause they want what they want
how they want when they want it
i just gave them twenty songs
now they want another hundred
i just see it as a challenge i could do it bitch i run it
worldwide tours type of shit i always wanted
while the rest of em just worry
bout bitches and getting blunted
still that same motherfucker from that ysone
only difference is im stronger
and better from when ive begun
so when people that never knew me
they tell me that i changed
that my music is different and my visions rearranged
i just stop and do my best to refrain
from having conversations with people that aint in my lane
will i die will i live
give the world everything i have to give
this is feelings on the page know my wisdom not my age
understand that im a man not defined by his wage
even though its in the millions
that shit dont define my brilliance
open your mind and maybe you can see the billions
of people that separated but all equal
to know the ending one must understand the prequel

i swear this music in my genes like denim
lyricism seep in em like venom
yes i know the flow hotter than lucifer
even though heaven sent him

spit it like holy water
prophetically repent em then we gone


somewhere this shit done got crazy
ive just been driving ms daisy
with my hands on the steering wheel
and my eyes on the pavement
i give a fuck bout where they went
i owe my lawyer a payment
they talking bout no arrangement
now i wonder where the rain went
i just been all in my mind homies tell me im stressing
i been counting whats on my bucket list
and not on my blessings
i think its time for a lesson hold up you better pay attention
i cant end up like my momma popping antidepressants
my therapist think im crazy well shit she probably does
all that stress im under i wonder why i dont do drugs
raised in a household full of killers and thugs

me and you together swear to god thats all that worked
away from you though man its just so hard to work hard to work
uh my heart is hard at work
we been together like ten years
goddamn took me as young man
everyday i wonder who i am who will i be where will i go
what will they write upon my grave
a free man born as a king who died as a slave
but everything he gave her was for nothing though
oh no i cant fade that shit i gotta let you go
you got me tripping like a flight to vegas
all this shit you got me doing man its outrageous
all i know is im living the life i never would
finally let you go i thought i never could
dont get me wrong cant forget the times shared
seem like everywhere i go i always know youre there
tried to run but my legs wont
i look away but my head dont
i love it when youre fresh
i love it when i take your top off and we share the same breath
i hate it that i need you nikki
but i love it when i feed you nikki
i hate that i bleed for you
uh i long and i need for you
but i love it when i taste you taste you
nothing can replace you replace you
i wish i could erase you youre everywhere i go
but youre everywhere i long to be
and all these other people that dont seem to understand
im just a man they always ask whats wrong with me
man youre everything i crave
youre the only thing i let in that would put me in the grave

on the front of this bus im busting my mind open
hoping these lyrics will keep me coping
on the grind like copin no time to bring the dope in

young sinatra i created im elated
it seem like everyones somehow related
letters back and forth from my homie
thats locked up in prison
doing fourteen its been five i know my hearts with him
ive been so busy it feel like forever since i hit him man
i think about how i wasnt shit when he went in
what if the tables was turned
and i was the one that been in damn
he said hes seen me in the magazine
he said hes seen me on fallon and kimmel
thats been my dog from the kennel
i never thought that out the millions watching he was one
it makes me reminisce about the times when we begun
skipping class with all of my homies
on a constant search for who i was
i rarely went to school they wonder why and thats because
my situation at home was alcoholics and drugs
i never graduated but i made it to the summit
dont get me wrong so many times
i thought that i would plummet
felt like i didnt have the heart and couldnt seem
to stomach all of the beef around my way
i mean i never wanted to live a life
where all youre truly living is a lie
i knew i always wanted more
and so they wonder why i said they wonder why

so what do you think about space
um space is called the galaxy

i wonder where is this hold up
get the fuck out my business show enough
we roll up then load up
just a bastard born out of wedlock
close to the earth like a dreadlock
got my sites on deadlock
visions of my enemy in a headlock
feel like im livin in bedrock surrounded by rubble
just a youngin in trouble
took a shot and then made it a double
took a shot and then made it a double
this that food for thought my school aint taught me good
no ingredients in my hood
but a tablespoon of this baking soda
gon make it good like it should
thats ignant isnt it hold up wait
now take a look at my pigment
tell me again we can never be kin
based on the color of my skin
matter of fact your lips aint thin
thats a club i dont wanna be in
my dna get done integrated
my god its innovative
thats a million miles away from administrative
i fuckin hate it anyway
long ago way back in the day in a place called west deer park
i was like five sit in my mama lap while she would drive
police would knock on the door i would hide
then they would talk to me and i would lie
hopin i dont die on this side of a fortyfive
then they would handcuff my mama and take her away
over down on the driveway
fast forward a couple of years and im bumpin that sade
fast forward a couple of more and im bumpin that my way
by sinatra so high so high oh my god damn
now im a grown man oh man
what the fuck done happened to the plan
i know as soon as i write this i might just go crazy crazy
anything but lazy i cant sleep why
cause if i do theres another motherfucker
wide awake on the creep tryna kill you and he will too
we livin like civilized people but far from equal
i hope i live a long life and get to see my sequel
my son my seed watch em grow and then watch em lead
let me proceed bumpin that californication by the red hot
fuck around and then hit em with a red dot
yall better not me fuckin with me
who him yeah me i be the god mc


i remember my life long ago in my adolescence
i could feel the presence in my residence
hesitant even thought it was evident
i should get the fuck
i know something is wrong
yeah i know something is wrong
feel like my mind gone
i know i play along i might drown in this song
huh im so focused huh i know you know this
uh when i make a move and feel like no one notice
uh when i quit my job uh i fuckin noticed
shit maybe then im noticed huh but maybe not
feel like this minimum wage is contagious
so outrageous my age is on my mind
walking to work and i go blind
sippin on that koolaid
gettin big wig money thats toupée
look around and see people with no class
like snow on a school day
yall cant do what i do do what i do
starin out this window like like erykah badu
livin life how i do is crazy
this shit never amaze me
but i still let it phase me and i dont know why
all i know is my mind racing
a million miles a minute the second im in it
yeah i be pacing bitch im back again
been here since way back when
now let that shit begin yeah

this album two but this song was written before the first
my mind racing im sick of pacing i feel the thirst
of those around me that down me and pray on my demise
but it only makes it that much better when i rise

this for the people that been through it and couldnt do it
had a vision but blew it while haters screaming i knew it
this is real so real
the type of shit that make you feel like you gotta kill
most of these people will never hit fruition
paying tuition when they shouldve just listened their intuition
now they wishing they was switching up their lifestyle
all alone with no one to dial
im just a man i got problems
understand this is all i ever wanted
yes i do it for the fans and i aint perfect
ive questioned if this life was even worth it
cause all the people care about is what lies on the surface
and my purpose is to do it like it aint never been done
always keep it real and remember where im from now

this album two but this song was written before the first
my mind racing im sick of pacing i feel the thirst
of those around me that down me and pray on my demise
but it only makes it that much better when i rise


ive been workin like ive never been
i struggle every day but i just cant let the devil in
and if i knew back then what i know right now
what i know right now
id be better than ive ever been better than ive ever been

you ever wonder what it all really means
heart full of dreams
i know ima do it go get it by any means
serving food for the thought like its rock to the fiends
i said this shit for years boy this life aint what it seems
sayin that you cant just solidifies you never will
said you would said you could but you aint got the skill
you gotta climb the highest mountain to master the hill
you gotta climb over your ego to master your will
gave up on your dreams for a suit and a pension
god damn i hope youre here for the intervention
you say you would if you had the money
dont make me mention
it dont cost nothin but time for you to pay attention
now dont get me wrong
i know theres people out there hatin on ya
and it feel like your selfesteem is breakin on ya
all they ever seem to do is hate when you speak
they spend seven days preyin on the weak
i know the world sleepin on ya like a sedative
talk all you want about me homie ima let it live
hater this hater that say i sound repetitive
hatin in your blood you was born to be negative

never been
i struggle every day but i just cant let the devil in
and if i knew back then what i know right now
what i know right now
id be better than ive ever been better than ive ever been

this is dedicated to everyone that never made it
and the people that persevered even though they was hated
they had a dream and a vision that they follow like a religion
but on the real the road to success is prone to collision
and every now and then something happens thats unexpected
like that newborn in your life cause you was fuckin unprotected
and i swear nobody perfect hell i know i aint
yeah i know this verse is heaven sent but im far from a saint
live a life with no complaints tryna do just what i can
learn from my fathers mistakes and become a better man
now plant a seed and watch em grow teach em everything i know
show him how to fight his battles and always go toe to toe
and this i know cause i been high low right wrong
but i had to do it all just so i could write this song
i spit knowledge like the listener is my only son
and grip the mic like im at war and its my only gun
sometimes this journey to the top can be a lonely one
yeah and this victory lap a lonely run
while my hometown screamin you the chosen one
tellin myself dont choke dont be the frozen one

ive been workin like ive never been
i struggle every day but i just cant let the devil in
and if i knew back then what i know right now
what i know right now
id be better than ive ever been better than ive ever been
ive been workin like ive never been
i struggle every day but i just cant let the devil in
and if i knew back then what i know right now
what i know right now
id be better than ive ever been better than ive ever been
ive been workin like ive never been
i struggle every day but i just cant let the devil in
and if i knew back then what i know right now
id be better than ive ever been better than ive ever been

um you like that take i like it
yeah should i make it more surreal though or
i think its good hey bobby run it


all day all day everyday everyday
we was on that block until we made a way we made a way
day to day man thats the only way only way

i execute it with the proper etiquette
everybody wanna get ahead of it no i cant take the time to stop

back in the day i was young broke  infamous
a young sinatra that was undeniable
who welcomed you to forever while under pressure
and told you the incredible true story of bobby tarantino
and everybody in the ultra eightyfive
goddamn it feel good to be alive
and all these bitches that i passed up
couldnt fuck witcha cause your hair was too gassed up
member creeping with the gat masked up

god damn its kinda crazy to reminisce on all this shit man
what it was like growing up
damn man just motherfuckers running in and out of the crib
doing drugs selling drugs all types of stuff
meanwhile i was just tryna keep it together
i was tryna make sensesense of all this shit around me
i didnt know how to take it how to perceive it you know what i mean
and then meanwhile im supposed to be going to school and getting good grades and shit
but im seeing like domestic violence in my house
and just so much going on
and im sure everybody was probably like man yo

why little bobby didnt come to school today
on the real i was doin anything to run away
and thats the same reason kids join gangs every day
cause they wanna be accepted but at home they too neglected
meanwhile white america quick to call him a thug
but all he ever wanted was a father to give him some love
tell him that he love him that he need him
promise he wont ever leave him
never smoke crack never lie and wont never beat him
it feel like for my life i been needed a break
looking at my family i aint wanna make the same mistake
and i know that shit sound fucked up but they not all doin great
oh god please
can i have a conversation with a member of my family without it ending asking me for five gs
to pay they bills or they lawyer fees huh
i learned something i aint giving yall a dime
ill give you something worth morethats my time
i aint dropping stacks im dropping knowledge
unless its for my nieces and nephews to go to college
and hit me on the phone hit me up
like uncle bob where you at
yeah i know your pockets fat but i dont give a fuck bout that
im glad we family uh
we a halfbreed family yeah yeah uh

and my dad took me to the studio

and ill never forget it i had like eight rhyme books
hell tell youhell tell you man
i just i went through them motherfuckers
i was rapping for like fifteen minutes straight
and that was my first time yo
i was like tenth grade in the studio
and i knew that this was what i wanted to do
i knew it

i knew it ever since i first saw kill bill
i been flowin like that blood uma thurman spilled
none other than the rza yeah he did the soundtrack
and then i discovered wutang soon as i found that
and then big l mos def and nas it wasnt no turning back
i couldnt change it if i tried homie how bout that
see im a student of the game so simple and plain
but ima take it back to before i ever sat first class on a plane

i was in college park right
