and so i pray you burn in hell and you never find the ocean

i hope your fire fire burns baby
i hope your fire fire burns baby
i hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told
and when youre reaching out for me youll see you reap everything you sow

you piece of shit you broke me down
thought you said you would hold me down
but i can see it in your eyes that youre blinded by the flashing lights
and yous a stupid muthafucker for letting this thing pass you by

i hope your fire fire burns baby
i hope your fire fire burns baby
i hope you lay down in your sleep and you choke on every lie you told
and when youre reaching out for me youll see you reap everything you sow
